For thousands of years the spinning
Earth provided a natural standard for our
measurements of time. However, since
1972 we have added more than 20 “leap
seconds” to our clocks to keep them
synchronized to the Earth. Why are such
adjustments needed? What does it take
to be a good standard? (Don Mason/The

ike all other sciences, physics is based on experimental observations and quantitative measurements. The main objective of physics is to ﬁnd the limited number of fundamental laws that govern natural phenomena and to use them to
develop theories that can predict the results of future experiments. The fundamental laws used in developing theories are expressed in the language of mathematics, the tool that provides a bridge between theory and experiment.
When a discrepancy between theory and experiment arises, new theories must
be formulated to remove the discrepancy. Many times a theory is satisfactory only
under limited conditions; a more general theory might be satisfactory without
such limitations. For example, the laws of motion discovered by Isaac Newton
(1642 – 1727) in the 17th century accurately describe the motion of bodies at normal speeds but do not apply to objects moving at speeds comparable with the
speed of light. In contrast, the special theory of relativity developed by Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955) in the early 1900s gives the same results as Newton’s laws at low
speeds but also correctly describes motion at speeds approaching the speed of
light. Hence, Einstein’s is a more general theory of motion.
Classical physics, which means all of the physics developed before 1900, includes the theories, concepts, laws, and experiments in classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.
Important contributions to classical physics were provided by Newton, who developed classical mechanics as a systematic theory and was one of the originators
of calculus as a mathematical tool. Major developments in mechanics continued in
the 18th century, but the ﬁelds of thermodynamics and electricity and magnetism
were not developed until the latter part of the 19th century, principally because
before that time the apparatus for controlled experiments was either too crude or
unavailable.
A new era in physics, usually referred to as modern physics, began near the end
of the 19th century. Modern physics developed mainly because of the discovery
that many physical phenomena could not be explained by classical physics. The
two most important developments in modern physics were the theories of relativity
and quantum mechanics. Einstein’s theory of relativity revolutionized the traditional concepts of space, time, and energy; quantum mechanics, which applies to
both the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, was originally formulated by a number of distinguished scientists to provide descriptions of physical phenomena at
the atomic level.
Scientists constantly work at improving our understanding of phenomena and
fundamental laws, and new discoveries are made every day. In many research
areas, a great deal of overlap exists between physics, chemistry, geology, and
biology, as well as engineering. Some of the most notable developments are
(1) numerous space missions and the landing of astronauts on the Moon,
(2) microcircuitry and high-speed computers, and (3) sophisticated imaging techniques used in scientiﬁc research and medicine. The impact such developments
and discoveries have had on our society has indeed been great, and it is very likely
that future discoveries and developments will be just as exciting and challenging
and of great beneﬁt to humanity.

STANDARDS OF LENGTH, MASS, AND TIME

The laws of physics are expressed in terms of basic quantities that require a clear definition. In mechanics, the three basic quantities are length (L), mass (M), and time
(T). All other quantities in mechanics can be expressed in terms of these three.

CHAPTER 1

Physics and Measurements

If we are to report the results of a measurement to someone who wishes to reproduce this measurement, a standard must be deﬁned. It would be meaningless if
a visitor from another planet were to talk to us about a length of 8 “glitches” if we
do not know the meaning of the unit glitch. On the other hand, if someone familiar with our system of measurement reports that a wall is 2 meters high and our
unit of length is deﬁned to be 1 meter, we know that the height of the wall is twice
our basic length unit. Likewise, if we are told that a person has a mass of 75 kilograms and our unit of mass is deﬁned to be 1 kilogram, then that person is 75
times as massive as our basic unit.1 Whatever is chosen as a standard must be readily accessible and possess some property that can be measured reliably — measurements taken by different people in different places must yield the same result.
In 1960, an international committee established a set of standards for length,
mass, and other basic quantities. The system established is an adaptation of the
metric system, and it is called the SI system of units. (The abbreviation SI comes
from the system’s French name “Système International.”) In this system, the units
of length, mass, and time are the meter, kilogram, and second, respectively. Other
SI standards established by the committee are those for temperature (the kelvin),
electric current (the ampere), luminous intensity (the candela), and the amount of
substance (the mole). In our study of mechanics we shall be concerned only with
the units of length, mass, and time.

Length
In A.D. 1120 the king of England decreed that the standard of length in his country would be named the yard and would be precisely equal to the distance from the
tip of his nose to the end of his outstretched arm. Similarly, the original standard
for the foot adopted by the French was the length of the royal foot of King Louis
XIV. This standard prevailed until 1799, when the legal standard of length in
France became the meter, deﬁned as one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole along one particular longitudinal line that passes through
Paris.
Many other systems for measuring length have been developed over the years,
but the advantages of the French system have caused it to prevail in almost all
countries and in scientiﬁc circles everywhere. As recently as 1960, the length of the
meter was deﬁned as the distance between two lines on a speciﬁc platinum –
iridium bar stored under controlled conditions in France. This standard was abandoned for several reasons, a principal one being that the limited accuracy with
which the separation between the lines on the bar can be determined does not
meet the current requirements of science and technology. In the 1960s and 1970s,
the meter was deﬁned as 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of orange-red light emitted
from a krypton-86 lamp. However, in October 1983, the meter (m) was redeﬁned
as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time of 1/299 792 458
second. In effect, this latest deﬁnition establishes that the speed of light in vacuum is precisely 299 792 458 m per second.
Table 1.1 lists approximate values of some measured lengths.

The need for assigning numerical values to various measured physical quantities was expressed by
Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) as follows: “I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you should know something about it, but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind. It may be the beginning of
knowledge but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of science.”

Mass
The basic SI unit of mass, the kilogram (kg), is deﬁned as the mass of a speciﬁc platinum – iridium alloy cylinder kept at the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures at Sèvres, France. This mass standard was established in
1887 and has not been changed since that time because platinum – iridium is an
unusually stable alloy (Fig. 1.1a). A duplicate of the Sèvres cylinder is kept at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Time

) of a mean
year 1900.2 The mean solar second was originally deﬁned as (60
solar day. The rotation of the Earth is now known to vary slightly with time, however, and therefore this motion is not a good one to use for deﬁning a standard.
In 1967, consequently, the second was redeﬁned to take advantage of the high
precision obtainable in a device known as an atomic clock (Fig. 1.1b). In this device,
the frequencies associated with certain atomic transitions can be measured to a
precision of one part in 1012. This is equivalent to an uncertainty of less than one
second every 30 000 years. Thus, in 1967 the SI unit of time, the second, was redeﬁned using the characteristic frequency of a particular kind of cesium atom as the
“reference clock.” The basic SI unit of time, the second (s), is deﬁned as 9 192
631 770 times the period of vibration of radiation from the cesium-133
atom.3 To keep these atomic clocks — and therefore all common clocks and

watches that are set to them — synchronized, it has sometimes been necessary to
add leap seconds to our clocks. This is not a new idea. In 46 B.C. Julius Caesar began the practice of adding extra days to the calendar during leap years so that the
seasons occurred at about the same date each year.
Since Einstein’s discovery of the linkage between space and time, precise measurement of time intervals requires that we know both the state of motion of the
clock used to measure the interval and, in some cases, the location of the clock as
well. Otherwise, for example, global positioning system satellites might be unable
to pinpoint your location with sufﬁcient accuracy, should you need rescuing.
Approximate values of time intervals are presented in Table 1.3.

THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATTER

A 1-kg cube of solid gold has a length of 3.73 cm on a side. Is this cube nothing
but wall-to-wall gold, with no empty space? If the cube is cut in half, the two pieces
still retain their chemical identity as solid gold. But what if the pieces are cut again
and again, indeﬁnitely? Will the smaller and smaller pieces always be gold? Questions such as these can be traced back to early Greek philosophers. Two of them —
Leucippus and his student Democritus — could not accept the idea that such cuttings could go on forever. They speculated that the process ultimately must end
when it produces a particle that can no longer be cut. In Greek, atomos means “not
sliceable.” From this comes our English word atom.
Let us review brieﬂy what is known about the structure of matter. All ordinary
matter consists of atoms, and each atom is made up of electrons surrounding a
central nucleus. Following the discovery of the nucleus in 1911, the question
arose: Does it have structure? That is, is the nucleus a single particle or a collection
of particles? The exact composition of the nucleus is not known completely even
today, but by the early 1930s a model evolved that helped us understand how the
nucleus behaves. Speciﬁcally, scientists determined that occupying the nucleus are
two basic entities, protons and neutrons. The proton carries a positive charge, and a
speciﬁc element is identiﬁed by the number of protons in its nucleus. This number is called the atomic number of the element. For instance, the nucleus of a hydrogen atom contains one proton (and so the atomic number of hydrogen is 1),
the nucleus of a helium atom contains two protons (atomic number 2), and the
nucleus of a uranium atom contains 92 protons (atomic number 92). In addition
to atomic number, there is a second number characterizing atoms — mass number, deﬁned as the number of protons plus neutrons in a nucleus. As we shall see,
the atomic number of an element never varies (i.e., the number of protons does
not vary) but the mass number can vary (i.e., the number of neutrons varies). Two
or more atoms of the same element having different mass numbers are isotopes
of one another.
The existence of neutrons was veriﬁed conclusively in 1932. A neutron has no
charge and a mass that is about equal to that of a proton. One of its primary purposes is to act as a “glue” that holds the nucleus together. If neutrons were not
present in the nucleus, the repulsive force between the positively charged particles
would cause the nucleus to come apart.
But is this where the breaking down stops? Protons, neutrons, and a host of
other exotic particles are now known to be composed of six different varieties of
particles called quarks, which have been given the names of up, down, strange,
charm, bottom, and top. The up, charm, and top quarks have charges of ⫹ 32 that of
the proton, whereas the down, strange, and bottom quarks have charges of ⫺ 13
that of the proton. The proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark
(Fig. 1.2), which you can easily show leads to the correct charge for the proton.
Likewise, the neutron consists of two down quarks and one up quark, giving a net
charge of zero.

Density

DENSITY

A property of any substance is its density ␳ (Greek letter rho), deﬁned as the
amount of mass contained in a unit volume, which we usually express as mass per
unit volume:

␳⬅

m
V

(1.1)

For example, aluminum has a density of 2.70 g/cm3, and lead has a density of
11.3 g/cm3. Therefore, a piece of aluminum of volume 10.0 cm3 has a mass of
27.0 g, whereas an equivalent volume of lead has a mass of 113 g. A list of densities
for various substances is given Table 1.5.
The difference in density between aluminum and lead is due, in part, to their
different atomic masses. The atomic mass of an element is the average mass of one
atom in a sample of the element that contains all the element’s isotopes, where the
relative amounts of isotopes are the same as the relative amounts found in nature.
The unit for atomic mass is the atomic mass unit (u), where 1 u ⫽ 1.660 540 2 ⫻
10⫺27 kg. The atomic mass of lead is 207 u, and that of aluminum is 27.0 u. However, the ratio of atomic masses, 207 u/27.0 u ⫽ 7.67, does not correspond to the
ratio of densities, (11.3 g/cm3)/(2.70 g/cm3) ⫽ 4.19. The discrepancy is due to
the difference in atomic separations and atomic arrangements in the crystal structure of these two substances.
The mass of a nucleus is measured relative to the mass of the nucleus of the
carbon-12 isotope, often written as 12C. (This isotope of carbon has six protons
and six neutrons. Other carbon isotopes have six protons but different numbers of
neutrons.) Practically all of the mass of an atom is contained within the nucleus.
Because the atomic mass of 12C is deﬁned to be exactly 12 u, the proton and neutron each have a mass of about 1 u.
One mole (mol) of a substance is that amount of the substance that contains as many particles (atoms, molecules, or other particles) as there are
atoms in 12 g of the carbon-12 isotope. One mole of substance A contains the
same number of particles as there are in 1 mol of any other substance B. For example, 1 mol of aluminum contains the same number of atoms as 1 mol of lead.

Experiments have shown that this number, known as Avogadro’s number, NA , is

Avogadro’s number is deﬁned so that 1 mol of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of
exactly 12 g. In general, the mass in 1 mol of any element is the element’s atomic
mass expressed in grams. For example, 1 mol of iron (atomic mass ⫽ 55.85 u) has
a mass of 55.85 g (we say its molar mass is 55.85 g/mol), and 1 mol of lead (atomic
mass ⫽ 207 u) has a mass of 207 g (its molar mass is 207 g/mol). Because there

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

The word dimension has a special meaning in physics. It usually denotes the physical nature of a quantity. Whether a distance is measured in the length unit feet or
the length unit meters, it is still a distance. We say the dimension — the physical
nature — of distance is length.
The symbols we use in this book to specify length, mass, and time are L, M,
and T, respectively. We shall often use brackets [ ] to denote the dimensions of a
physical quantity. For example, the symbol we use for speed in this book is v, and
in our notation the dimensions of speed are written [v] ⫽ L/T. As another example, the dimensions of area, for which we use the symbol A, are [A] ⫽ L2. The dimensions of area, volume, speed, and acceleration are listed in Table 1.6.
In solving problems in physics, there is a useful and powerful procedure called
dimensional analysis. This procedure, which should always be used, will help minimize the need for rote memorization of equations. Dimensional analysis makes
use of the fact that dimensions can be treated as algebraic quantities. That is,
quantities can be added or subtracted only if they have the same dimensions. Furthermore, the terms on both sides of an equation must have the same dimensions.

By following these simple rules, you can use dimensional analysis to help determine whether an expression has the correct form. The relationship can be correct
only if the dimensions are the same on both sides of the equation.
To illustrate this procedure, suppose you wish to derive a formula for the distance x traveled by a car in a time t if the car starts from rest and moves with constant acceleration a. In Chapter 2, we shall ﬁnd that the correct expression is
x ⫽ 12at 2. Let us use dimensional analysis to check the validity of this expression.
The quantity x on the left side has the dimension of length. For the equation to be
dimensionally correct, the quantity on the right side must also have the dimension
of length. We can perform a dimensional check by substituting the dimensions for
acceleration, L/T 2, and time, T, into the equation. That is, the dimensional form
of the equation x ⫽ 12at 2 is
L
⭈T 2 ⫽ L
T2

L⫽

The units of time squared cancel as shown, leaving the unit of length.
A more general procedure using dimensional analysis is to set up an expression of the form
x ⬀ a nt m
where n and m are exponents that must be determined and the symbol ⬀ indicates
a proportionality. This relationship is correct only if the dimensions of both sides
are the same. Because the dimension of the left side is length, the dimension of
the right side must also be length. That is,
[a nt m] ⫽ L ⫽ LT 0
Because the dimensions of acceleration are L/T 2 and the dimension of time is T,
we have

Analysis of an Equation

Show that the expression v ⫽ at is dimensionally correct,
where v represents speed, a acceleration, and t a time interval.

For the speed term, we have from Table 1.6

Analysis of a Power Law

Suppose we are told that the acceleration a of a particle moving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius r is proportional
to some power of r, say r n, and some power of v, say v m. How
can we determine the values of n and m?

Sometimes it is necessary to convert units from one system to another. Conversion
factors between the SI units and conventional units of length are as follows:

CONVERSION OF UNITS

1 mi ⫽ 1 609 m ⫽ 1.609 km

1 ft ⫽ 0.304 8 m ⫽ 30.48 cm

1 m ⫽ 39.37 in. ⫽ 3.281 ft

1 in. ⬅ 0.025 4 m ⫽ 2.54 cm (exactly)

A more complete list of conversion factors can be found in Appendix A.
Units can be treated as algebraic quantities that can cancel each other. For example, suppose we wish to convert 15.0 in. to centimeters. Because 1 in. is deﬁned
as exactly 2.54 cm, we ﬁnd that
15.0 in. ⫽ (15.0 in.)(2.54 cm/in.) ⫽ 38.1 cm
cm
This works because multiplying by (2.54
1 in. ) is the same as multiplying by 1, because
the numerator and denominator describe identical things.

ESTIMATES AND ORDER-OFMAGNITUDE CALCULATIONS

It is often useful to compute an approximate answer to a physical problem even
where little information is available. Such an approximate answer can then be
used to determine whether a more accurate calculation is necessary. Approximations are usually based on certain assumptions, which must be modiﬁed if greater
accuracy is needed. Thus, we shall sometimes refer to the order of magnitude of a
certain quantity as the power of ten of the number that describes that quantity. If,
for example, we say that a quantity increases in value by three orders of magnitude, this means that its value is increased by a factor of 103 ⫽ 1000. Also, if a
quantity is given as 3 ⫻ 103, we say that the order of magnitude of that quantity is
103 (or in symbolic form, 3 ⫻ 103 ⬃ 103). Likewise, the quantity 8 ⫻ 107 ⬃ 108.
The spirit of order-of-magnitude calculations, sometimes referred to as
“guesstimates” or “ball-park ﬁgures,” is given in the following quotation: “Make an
estimate before every calculation, try a simple physical argument . . . before
every derivation, guess the answer to every puzzle. Courage: no one else needs to

13

14

CHAPTER 1

know what the guess is.” 4 Inaccuracies caused by guessing too low for one number
are often canceled out by other guesses that are too high. You will ﬁnd that with
practice your guesstimates get better and better. Estimation problems can be fun
to work as you freely drop digits, venture reasonable approximations for unknown
numbers, make simplifying assumptions, and turn the question around into something you can answer in your head.

EXAMPLE 1.5

Breaths in a Lifetime

Estimate the number of breaths taken during an average life
span.

Solution We shall start by guessing that the typical life
span is about 70 years. The only other estimate we must make
in this example is the average number of breaths that a person takes in 1 min. This number varies, depending on
whether the person is exercising, sleeping, angry, serene, and
so forth. To the nearest order of magnitude, we shall choose
10 breaths per minute as our estimate of the average. (This is
certainly closer to the true value than 1 breath per minute or
100 breaths per minute.) The number of minutes in a year is

EXAMPLE 1.6

approximately
1 yr ⫻ 400

days
h
min
⫻ 25
⫻ 60
⫽ 6 ⫻ 105 min
yr
day
h

Notice how much simpler it is to multiply 400 ⫻ 25 than it
is to work with the more accurate 365 ⫻ 24. These approximate values for the number of days in a year and the number
of hours in a day are close enough for our purposes. Thus, in
70 years there will be (70 yr)(6 ⫻ 105 min/yr) ⫽ 4 ⫻ 107
min. At a rate of 10 breaths/min, an individual would take
4 ⫻ 10 8 breaths in a lifetime.

It’s a Long Way to San Jose

Estimate the number of steps a person would take walking
from New York to Los Angeles.

Now we switch to scientiﬁc notation so that we can do the
calculation mentally:

Solution Without looking up the distance between these
two cities, you might remember from a geography class that
they are about 3 000 mi apart. The next approximation we
must make is the length of one step. Of course, this length
depends on the person doing the walking, but we can estimate that each step covers about 2 ft. With our estimated step
size, we can determine the number of steps in 1 mi. Because
this is a rough calculation, we round 5 280 ft/mi to 5 000
ft/mi. (What percentage error does this introduce?) This
conversion factor gives us

(3 ⫻ 10 3 mi)(2.5 ⫻ 10 3 steps/mi) ⫽ 7.5 ⫻ 10 6 steps
⬃ 10 7 steps
So if we intend to walk across the United States, it will take us
on the order of ten million steps. This estimate is almost certainly too small because we have not accounted for curving
roads and going up and down hills and mountains. Nonetheless, it is probably within an order of magnitude of the correct answer.

EXAMPLE 1.7

How Much Gas Do We Use?

Estimate the number of gallons of gasoline used each year by
all the cars in the United States.

Solution There are about 270 million people in the
United States, and so we estimate that the number of cars in
the country is 100 million (guessing that there are between
two and three people per car). We also estimate that the aver-

age distance each car travels per year is 10 000 mi. If we assume a gasoline consumption of 20 mi/gal or 0.05 gal/mi,
then each car uses about 500 gal/yr. Multiplying this by the
total number of cars in the United States gives an estimated
total consumption of 5 ⫻ 1010 gal ⬃ 10 11 gal.

Significant Figures

SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

When physical quantities are measured, the measured values are known only to
within the limits of the experimental uncertainty. The value of this uncertainty can
depend on various factors, such as the quality of the apparatus, the skill of the experimenter, and the number of measurements performed.
Suppose that we are asked to measure the area of a computer disk label using
a meter stick as a measuring instrument. Let us assume that the accuracy to which
we can measure with this stick is ⫾ 0.1 cm. If the length of the label is measured to
be 5.5 cm, we can claim only that its length lies somewhere between 5.4 cm and
5.6 cm. In this case, we say that the measured value has two signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Likewise, if the label’s width is measured to be 6.4 cm, the actual value lies between 6.3 cm and 6.5 cm. Note that the signiﬁcant ﬁgures include the ﬁrst estimated digit. Thus we could write the measured values as (5.5 ⫾ 0.1) cm and
(6.4 ⫾ 0.1) cm.
Now suppose we want to ﬁnd the area of the label by multiplying the two measured values. If we were to claim the area is (5.5 cm)(6.4 cm) ⫽ 35.2 cm2, our answer would be unjustiﬁable because it contains three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, which is
greater than the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in either of the measured lengths. A
good rule of thumb to use in determining the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures that
can be claimed is as follows:

When multiplying several quantities, the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the
ﬁnal answer is the same as the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the least accurate
of the quantities being multiplied, where “least accurate” means “having the
lowest number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.” The same rule applies to division.

Applying this rule to the multiplication example above, we see that the answer
for the area can have only two signiﬁcant ﬁgures because our measured lengths
have only two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Thus, all we can claim is that the area is 35 cm2,
realizing that the value can range between (5.4 cm)(6.3 cm) ⫽ 34 cm2 and
(5.6 cm)(6.5 cm) ⫽ 36 cm2.
Zeros may or may not be signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Those used to position the decimal point in such numbers as 0.03 and 0.007 5 are not signiﬁcant. Thus, there are
one and two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, respectively, in these two values. When the zeros
come after other digits, however, there is the possibility of misinterpretation. For
example, suppose the mass of an object is given as 1 500 g. This value is ambiguous because we do not know whether the last two zeros are being used to locate
the decimal point or whether they represent signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the measurement. To remove this ambiguity, it is common to use scientiﬁc notation to indicate
the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. In this case, we would express the mass as 1.5 ⫻
103 g if there are two signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the measured value, 1.50 ⫻ 103 g if
there are three signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and 1.500 ⫻ 103 g if there are four. The same
rule holds when the number is less than 1, so that 2.3 ⫻ 10⫺4 has two signiﬁcant
ﬁgures (and so could be written 0.000 23) and 2.30 ⫻ 10⫺4 has three signiﬁcant
ﬁgures (also written 0.000 230). In general, a signiﬁcant ﬁgure is a reliably
known digit (other than a zero used to locate the decimal point).
For addition and subtraction, you must consider the number of decimal places
when you are determining how many signiﬁcant ﬁgures to report.

QuickLab
Determine the thickness of a page
from this book. (Note that numbers
that have no measurement errors —
like the count of a number of
pages — do not affect the signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in a calculation.) In terms of
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, why is it better to
measure the thickness of as many
pages as possible and then divide by
the number of sheets?

16

CHAPTER 1

Physics and Measurements

When numbers are added or subtracted, the number of decimal places in the
result should equal the smallest number of decimal places of any term in the
sum.
For example, if we wish to compute 123 ⫹ 5.35, the answer given to the correct number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures is 128 and not 128.35. If we compute the sum 1.000 1 ⫹
0.000 3 ⫽ 1.000 4, the result has ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures, even though one of the terms
in the sum, 0.000 3, has only one signiﬁcant ﬁgure. Likewise, if we perform the subtraction 1.002 ⫺ 0.998 ⫽ 0.004, the result has only one signiﬁcant ﬁgure even though
one term has four signiﬁcant ﬁgures and the other has three. In this book, most of
the numerical examples and end-of-chapter problems will yield answers having three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. When carrying out estimates we shall typically work
with a single signiﬁcant ﬁgure.

The Area of a Rectangle

⬇ (209 ⫾ 4) cm2
Because the input data were given to only three signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, we cannot claim any more in our result. Do you see
why we did not need to multiply the uncertainties 0.2 cm and
0.1 cm?

Installing a Carpet

A carpet is to be installed in a room whose length is measured
to be 12.71 m and whose width is measured to be 3.46 m. Find
the area of the room.

Solution If you multiply 12.71 m by 3.46 m on your calculator, you will get an answer of 43.976 6 m2. How many of
these numbers should you claim? Our rule of thumb for multiplication tells us that you can claim only the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the least accurate of the quantities being
measured. In this example, we have only three signiﬁcant ﬁgures in our least accurate measurement, so we should express
our ﬁnal answer as 44.0 m2.

Note that in reducing 43.976 6 to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures
for our answer, we used a general rule for rounding off numbers that states that the last digit retained (the 9 in this example) is increased by 1 if the ﬁrst digit dropped (here, the 7) is
5 or greater. (A technique for avoiding error accumulation is
to delay rounding of numbers in a long calculation until you
have the ﬁnal result. Wait until you are ready to copy the answer from your calculator before rounding to the correct
number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.)

SUMMARY
The three fundamental physical quantities of mechanics are length, mass, and
time, which in the SI system have the units meters (m), kilograms (kg), and seconds (s), respectively. Preﬁxes indicating various powers of ten are used with these
three basic units. The density of a substance is deﬁned as its mass per unit volume.
Different substances have different densities mainly because of differences in their
atomic masses and atomic arrangements.
The number of particles in one mole of any element or compound, called
Avogadro’s number, NA , is 6.02 ⫻ 1023.
The method of dimensional analysis is very powerful in solving physics problems. Dimensions can be treated as algebraic quantities. By making estimates and
making order-of-magnitude calculations, you should be able to approximate the
answer to a problem when there is not enough information available to completely
specify an exact solution.
When you compute a result from several measured numbers, each of which
has a certain accuracy, you should give the result with the correct number of significant ﬁgures.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
1.1

False. Dimensional analysis gives the units of the proportionality constant but provides no information about its
numerical value. For example, experiments show that
doubling the radius of a solid sphere increases its mass
8-fold, and tripling the radius increases the mass 27-fold.
Therefore, its mass is proportional to the cube of its radius. Because m ⬀ r 3we
, can write m ⫽ kr 3. Dimensional analysis shows that the proportionality constant k
must have units kg/m3, but to determine its numerical
value requires either experimental data or geometrical
reasoning.

be better to record the measurement as 1.044 m: this indicates that you know the position to the nearest millimeter, assuming the meter stick has millimeter markings on its scale.

CHAPTER 2

Motion in One Dimension

A

s a ﬁrst step in studying classical mechanics, we describe motion in terms of
space and time while ignoring the agents that caused that motion. This portion of classical mechanics is called kinematics. (The word kinematics has the
same root as cinema. Can you see why?) In this chapter we consider only motion in
one dimension. We ﬁrst deﬁne displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Then, using these concepts, we study the motion of objects traveling in one dimension with
a constant acceleration.
From everyday experience we recognize that motion represents a continuous
change in the position of an object. In physics we are concerned with three types
of motion: translational, rotational, and vibrational. A car moving down a highway
is an example of translational motion, the Earth’s spin on its axis is an example of
rotational motion, and the back-and-forth movement of a pendulum is an example
of vibrational motion. In this and the next few chapters, we are concerned only
with translational motion. (Later in the book we shall discuss rotational and vibrational motions.)
In our study of translational motion, we describe the moving object as a particle regardless of its size. In general, a particle is a point-like mass having inﬁnitesimal size. For example, if we wish to describe the motion of the Earth around
the Sun, we can treat the Earth as a particle and obtain reasonably accurate data
about its orbit. This approximation is justiﬁed because the radius of the Earth’s orbit is large compared with the dimensions of the Earth and the Sun. As an example on a much smaller scale, it is possible to explain the pressure exerted by a gas
on the walls of a container by treating the gas molecules as particles.

DISPLACEMENT, VELOCITY, AND SPEED

The motion of a particle is completely known if the particle’s position in space is
known at all times. Consider a car moving back and forth along the x axis, as shown
in Figure 2.1a. When we begin collecting position data, the car is 30 m to the right
of a road sign. (Let us assume that all data in this example are known to two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. To convey this information, we should report the initial position as
3.0 ⫻ 101 m. We have written this value in this simpler form to make the discussion
easier to follow.) We start our clock and once every 10 s note the car’s location relative to the sign. As you can see from Table 2.1, the car is moving to the right (which
we have deﬁned as the positive direction) during the ﬁrst 10 s of motion, from position 훽 to position 훾. The position values now begin to decrease, however, because
the car is backing up from position 훾 through position . In fact, at , 30 s after
we start measuring, the car is alongside the sign we are using as our origin of coordinates. It continues moving to the left and is more than 50 m to the left of the sign
when we stop recording information after our sixth data point. A graph of this information is presented in Figure 2.1b. Such a plot is called a position – time graph.
If a particle is moving, we can easily determine its change in position. The displacement of a particle is deﬁned as its change in position. As it moves from
an initial position x i to a ﬁnal position xf , its displacement is given by x f ⫺ x i . We
use the Greek letter delta (⌬) to denote the change in a quantity. Therefore, we
write the displacement, or change in position, of the particle as
⌬x ⬅ x f ⫺ x i

(2.1)

From this deﬁnition we see that ⌬x is positive if xf is greater than x i and negative if
xf is less than x i .

A very easy mistake to make is not to recognize the difference between displacement and distance traveled (Fig. 2.2). A baseball player hitting a home run
travels a distance of 360 ft in the trip around the bases. However, the player’s displacement is zero because his ﬁnal and initial positions are identical.
Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. Many other physical quantities, including velocity and acceleration, also are vectors. In general, a vector is a
physical quantity that requires the speciﬁcation of both direction and magnitude. By contrast, a scalar is a quantity that has magnitude and no direction. In this chapter, we use plus and minus signs to indicate vector direction. We
can do this because the chapter deals with one-dimensional motion only; this
means that any object we study can be moving only along a straight line. For example, for horizontal motion, let us arbitrarily specify to the right as being the positive direction. It follows that any object always moving to the right undergoes a

positive displacement ⫹⌬x, and any object moving to the left undergoes a negative
displacement ⫺⌬x. We shall treat vectors in greater detail in Chapter 3.
There is one very important point that has not yet been mentioned. Note that
the graph in Figure 2.1b does not consist of just six data points but is actually a
smooth curve. The graph contains information about the entire 50-s interval during
which we watched the car move. It is much easier to see changes in position from
the graph than from a verbal description or even a table of numbers. For example, it
is clear that the car was covering more ground during the middle of the 50-s interval
than at the end. Between positions 훿 and , the car traveled almost 40 m, but during the last 10 s, between positions  and , it moved less than half that far. A common way of comparing these different motions is to divide the displacement ⌬x that
occurs between two clock readings by the length of that particular time interval ⌬t.
This turns out to be a very useful ratio, one that we shall use many times. For convenience, the ratio has been given a special name — average velocity. The average velocity vx of a particle is deﬁned as the particle’s displacement ⌬ x divided by
the time interval ⌬t during which that displacement occurred:
vx ⬅

Average velocity

3.2

⌬x
⌬t

(2.2)

where the subscript x indicates motion along the x axis. From this deﬁnition we
see that average velocity has dimensions of length divided by time (L/T) — meters
per second in SI units.
Although the distance traveled for any motion is always positive, the average velocity of a particle moving in one dimension can be positive or negative, depending
on the sign of the displacement. (The time interval ⌬t is always positive.) If the coordinate of the particle increases in time (that is, if x f ⬎ x i), then ⌬x is positive and
v x ⫽ ⌬x/⌬t is positive. This case corresponds to motion in the positive x direction.
If the coordinate decreases in time (that is, if x f ⬍ x i), then ⌬x is negative and
hence v x is negative. This case corresponds to motion in the negative x direction.

Instantaneous Velocity and Speed

We can interpret average velocity geometrically by drawing a straight line between any two points on the position – time graph in Figure 2.1b. This line forms
the hypotenuse of a right triangle of height ⌬x and base ⌬t. The slope of this line
is the ratio ⌬x/⌬t. For example, the line between positions 훽 and 훾 has a slope
equal to the average velocity of the car between those two times, (52 m ⫺ 30 m)/
(10 s ⫺ 0) ⫽ 2.2 m/s.
In everyday usage, the terms speed and velocity are interchangeable. In physics,
however, there is a clear distinction between these two quantities. Consider a
marathon runner who runs more than 40 km, yet ends up at his starting point. His
average velocity is zero! Nonetheless, we need to be able to quantify how fast he
was running. A slightly different ratio accomplishes this for us. The average
speed of a particle, a scalar quantity, is deﬁned as the total distance traveled divided by the total time it takes to travel that distance:
Average speed ⫽

total distance
total time

Average speed

The SI unit of average speed is the same as the unit of average velocity: meters
per second. However, unlike average velocity, average speed has no direction and
hence carries no algebraic sign.
Knowledge of the average speed of a particle tells us nothing about the details
of the trip. For example, suppose it takes you 8.0 h to travel 280 km in your car.
The average speed for your trip is 35 km/h. However, you most likely traveled at
various speeds during the trip, and the average speed of 35 km/h could result
from an inﬁnite number of possible speed values.

EXAMPLE 2.1

Calculating the Variables of Motion

Find the displacement, average velocity, and average speed of
the car in Figure 2.1a between positions 훽 and .

Solution The units of displacement must be meters, and
the numerical result should be of the same order of magnitude as the given position data (which means probably not 10
or 100 times bigger or smaller). From the position – time
graph given in Figure 2.1b, note that x A ⫽ 30 m at t A ⫽ 0 s
and that x F ⫽ ⫺53 m at t F ⫽ 50 s. Using these values along
with the deﬁnition of displacement, Equation 2.1, we ﬁnd
that
⌬x ⫽ x F ⫺ x A ⫽ ⫺53 m ⫺ 30 m ⫽ ⫺83 m

magnitude as the supplied data. A quick look at Figure 2.1a
indicates that this is the correct answer.
It is difﬁcult to estimate the average velocity without completing the calculation, but we expect the units to be meters
per second. Because the car ends up to the left of where we
started taking data, we know the average velocity must be
negative. From Equation 2.2,
vx ⫽
⫽

⫺83 m
⫺53 m ⫺ 30 m
⫽
⫽ ⫺1.7 m/s
50 s ⫺ 0 s
50 s

We ﬁnd the car’s average speed for this trip by adding the
distances traveled and dividing by the total time:

This result means that the car ends up 83 m in the negative
direction (to the left, in this case) from where it started. This
number has the correct units and is of the same order of

INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED

Often we need to know the velocity of a particle at a particular instant in time,
rather than over a ﬁnite time interval. For example, even though you might want
to calculate your average velocity during a long automobile trip, you would be especially interested in knowing your velocity at the instant you noticed the police

car parked alongside the road in front of you. In other words, you would like to be
able to specify your velocity just as precisely as you can specify your position by noting what is happening at a speciﬁc clock reading — that is, at some speciﬁc instant.
It may not be immediately obvious how to do this. What does it mean to talk about
how fast something is moving if we “freeze time” and talk only about an individual
instant? This is a subtle point not thoroughly understood until the late 1600s. At
that time, with the invention of calculus, scientists began to understand how to describe an object’s motion at any moment in time.
To see how this is done, consider Figure 2.3a. We have already discussed the
average velocity for the interval during which the car moved from position 훽 to
position 훾 (given by the slope of the dark blue line) and for the interval during
which it moved from 훽 to  (represented by the slope of the light blue line).
Which of these two lines do you think is a closer approximation of the initial velocity of the car? The car starts out by moving to the right, which we deﬁned to be the
positive direction. Therefore, being positive, the value of the average velocity during the 훽 to 훾 interval is probably closer to the initial value than is the value of
the average velocity during the 훽 to  interval, which we determined to be negative in Example 2.1. Now imagine that we start with the dark blue line and slide
point 훾 to the left along the curve, toward point 훽, as in Figure 2.3b. The line between the points becomes steeper and steeper, and as the two points get extremely
close together, the line becomes a tangent line to the curve, indicated by the green
line on the graph. The slope of this tangent line represents the velocity of the car
at the moment we started taking data, at point 훽. What we have done is determine
the instantaneous velocity at that moment. In other words, the instantaneous velocity vx equals the limiting value of the ratio ⌬x/⌬t as ⌬t approaches zero:1

Note that the displacement ⌬x also approaches zero as ⌬t approaches zero. As ⌬x and ⌬t become
smaller and smaller, the ratio ⌬x/⌬t approaches a value equal to the slope of the line tangent to the
x-versus-t curve.

(2.4)

The instantaneous velocity can be positive, negative, or zero. When the slope
of the position – time graph is positive, such as at any time during the ﬁrst 10 s in
Figure 2.3, vx is positive. After point 훾, vx is negative because the slope is negative.
At the peak, the slope and the instantaneous velocity are zero.
From here on, we use the word velocity to designate instantaneous velocity.
When it is average velocity we are interested in, we always use the adjective average.
The instantaneous speed of a particle is deﬁned as the magnitude of its
velocity. As with average speed, instantaneous speed has no direction associated
with it and hence carries no algebraic sign. For example, if one particle has a
velocity of ⫹ 25 m/s along a given line and another particle has a velocity of
⫺ 25 m/s along the same line, both have a speed2 of 25 m/s.

A particle moves along the x axis. Its x coordinate varies with
time according to the expression x ⫽ ⫺4t ⫹ 2t 2, where x is in

motion is shown in Figure 2.4. Note that the particle moves in

at the moment t ⫽ 1 s, and moves in the positive x direction
for t ⬎ 1 s. (a) Determine the displacement of the particle in

Solution

During the ﬁrst time interval, we have a negative
slope and hence a negative velocity. Thus, we know that the
displacement between 훽 and 훾 must be a negative number
having units of meters. Similarly, we expect the displacement
between 훾 and  to be positive.
In the ﬁrst time interval, we set t i ⫽ t A ⫽ 0 and

have the units required for dimensional consistency. When we start our clocks at t ⫽ 0 s, we usually do
not mean to limit the precision to a single digit. Consider any zero value in this book to have as many
signiﬁcant ﬁgures as you need.

Solution Certainly we can guess that this instantaneous velocity must be of the same order of magnitude as our previous results, that is, around 4 m/s. Examining the graph, we
see that the slope of the tangent at position 훿 is greater than
the slope of the blue line connecting points 훾 and . Thus,
we expect the answer to be greater than 4 m/s. By measuring
the slope of the position – time graph at t ⫽ 2.5 s, we ﬁnd that

ACCELERATION

In the last example, we worked with a situation in which the velocity of a particle
changed while the particle was moving. This is an extremely common occurrence.
(How constant is your velocity as you ride a city bus?) It is easy to quantify changes
in velocity as a function of time in exactly the same way we quantify changes in position as a function of time. When the velocity of a particle changes with time, the
particle is said to be accelerating. For example, the velocity of a car increases when
you step on the gas and decreases when you apply the brakes. However, we need a
better deﬁnition of acceleration than this.
Suppose a particle moving along the x axis has a velocity vxi at time ti and a velocity vxf at time tf , as in Figure 2.5a.
The average acceleration of the particle is deﬁned as the change in velocity ⌬vx
divided by the time interval ⌬t during which that change occurred:

As with velocity, when the motion being analyzed is one-dimensional, we can
use positive and negative signs to indicate the direction of the acceleration. Because the dimensions of velocity are L/T and the dimension of time is T, accelera-

Acceleration

tion has dimensions of length divided by time squared, or L/T 2. The SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s 2). It might be easier to interpret
these units if you think of them as meters per second per second. For example,
suppose an object has an acceleration of 2 m/s2. You should form a mental
image of the object having a velocity that is along a straight line and is increasing
by 2 m/s during every 1-s interval. If the object starts from rest, you should be
able to picture it moving at a velocity of ⫹ 2 m/s after 1 s, at ⫹ 4 m/s after 2 s, and
so on.
In some situations, the value of the average acceleration may be different over
different time intervals. It is therefore useful to deﬁne the instantaneous acceleration
as the limit of the average acceleration as ⌬t approaches zero. This concept is analogous to the deﬁnition of instantaneous velocity discussed in the previous section.
If we imagine that point 훾 is brought closer and closer to point 훽 in Figure 2.5a
and take the limit of ⌬vx /⌬t as ⌬t approaches zero, we obtain the instantaneous
acceleration:

(2.6)

Instantaneous acceleration

That is, the instantaneous acceleration equals the derivative of the velocity
with respect to time, which by deﬁnition is the slope of the velocity – time graph
(Fig. 2.5b). Thus, we see that just as the velocity of a moving particle is the slope of
the particle’s x-t graph, the acceleration of a particle is the slope of the particle’s
vx -t graph. One can interpret the derivative of the velocity with respect to time as the
time rate of change of velocity. If ax is positive, then the acceleration is in the positive
x direction; if ax is negative, then the acceleration is in the negative x direction.
From now on we shall use the term acceleration to mean instantaneous acceleration. When we mean average acceleration, we shall always use the adjective
average.
Because vx ⫽ dx/dt, the acceleration can also be written

That is, in one-dimensional motion, the acceleration equals the second derivative of
x with respect to time.
Figure 2.6 illustrates how an acceleration – time graph is related to a
velocity – time graph. The acceleration at any time is the slope of the velocity – time
graph at that time. Positive values of acceleration correspond to those points in
Figure 2.6a where the velocity is increasing in the positive x direction. The acceler-

ation reaches a maximum at time t A , when the slope of the velocity – time graph is
a maximum. The acceleration then goes to zero at time t B , when the velocity is a
maximum (that is, when the slope of the vx -t graph is zero). The acceleration is
negative when the velocity is decreasing in the positive x direction, and it reaches
its most negative value at time t C .

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2.3

Graphical Relationships Between x, vx , and ax

The position of an object moving along the x axis varies with
time as in Figure 2.7a. Graph the velocity versus time and the
acceleration versus time for the object.

Solution The velocity at any instant is the slope of the tangent to the x -t graph at that instant. Between t ⫽ 0 and
t ⫽ t A , the slope of the x-t graph increases uniformly, and so
the velocity increases linearly, as shown in Figure 2.7b. Between t A and t B , the slope of the x -t graph is constant, and so
the velocity remains constant. At t D , the slope of the x-t graph
is zero, so the velocity is zero at that instant. Between t D and
t E , the slope of the x -t graph and thus the velocity are negative and decrease uniformly in this interval. In the interval t E
to t F , the slope of the x -t graph is still negative, and at t F it
goes to zero. Finally, after t F , the slope of the x -t graph is
zero, meaning that the object is at rest for t ⬎ t F .
The acceleration at any instant is the slope of the tangent
to the vx -t graph at that instant. The graph of acceleration
versus time for this object is shown in Figure 2.7c. The acceleration is constant and positive between 0 and t A, where the
slope of the vx -t graph is positive. It is zero between t A and t B
and for t ⬎ t F because the slope of the vx -t graph is zero at
these times. It is negative between t B and t E because the slope
of the vx -t graph is negative during this interval.

Solution

Figure 2.8 is a vx -t graph that was created from
the velocity versus time expression given in the problem statement. Because the slope of the entire vx -t curve is negative,
we expect the acceleration to be negative.

Therefore, the average acceleration in the speciﬁed time interval ⌬t ⫽ t B ⫺ t A ⫽ 2.0 s is

What we have done by comparing the average acceleration
during the interval between 훽 and 훾 (⫺10 m/s2) with the
instantaneous value at 훾 (⫺20 m/s2) is compare the slope of
the line (not shown) joining 훽 and 훾 with the slope of the
tangent at 훾.
Note that the acceleration is not constant in this example.
Situations involving constant acceleration are treated in Section 2.5.

So far we have evaluated the derivatives of a function by starting with the deﬁnition of the function and then taking the limit of a speciﬁc ratio. Those of you familiar with calculus should recognize that there are speciﬁc rules for taking derivatives. These rules, which are listed in Appendix B.6, enable us to evaluate
derivatives quickly. For instance, one rule tells us that the derivative of any constant is zero. As another example, suppose x is proportional to some power of t,
such as in the expression
x ⫽ At n
where A and n are constants. (This is a very common functional form.) The derivative of x with respect to t is
dx
⫽ nAt n⫺1

Applying this rule to Example 2.4, in which vx ⫽ 40 ⫺ 5t 2, we ﬁnd that a x ⫽

Motion in One Dimension

MOTION DIAGRAMS

The concepts of velocity and acceleration are often confused with each other, but
in fact they are quite different quantities. It is instructive to use motion diagrams
to describe the velocity and acceleration while an object is in motion. In order not
to confuse these two vector quantities, for which both magnitude and direction
are important, we use red for velocity vectors and violet for acceleration vectors, as
shown in Figure 2.9. The vectors are sketched at several instants during the motion of the object, and the time intervals between adjacent positions are assumed
to be equal. This illustration represents three sets of strobe photographs of a car
moving from left to right along a straight roadway. The time intervals between
ﬂashes are equal in each diagram.
In Figure 2.9a, the images of the car are equally spaced, showing us that the
car moves the same distance in each time interval. Thus, the car moves with constant positive velocity and has zero acceleration.
In Figure 2.9b, the images become farther apart as time progresses. In this
case, the velocity vector increases in time because the car’s displacement between
adjacent positions increases in time. The car is moving with a positive velocity and a
positive acceleration.
In Figure 2.9c, we can tell that the car slows as it moves to the right because its
displacement between adjacent images decreases with time. In this case, the car
moves to the right with a constant negative acceleration. The velocity vector decreases in time and eventually reaches zero. From this diagram we see that the acceleration and velocity vectors are not in the same direction. The car is moving
with a positive velocity but with a negative acceleration.
You should be able to construct motion diagrams for a car that moves initially
to the left with a constant positive or negative acceleration.

ONE-DIMENSIONAL MOTION WITH
CONSTANT ACCELERATION

If the acceleration of a particle varies in time, its motion can be complex and difﬁcult to analyze. However, a very common and simple type of one-dimensional motion is that in which the acceleration is constant. When this is the case, the average
acceleration over any time interval equals the instantaneous acceleration at any instant within the interval, and the velocity changes at the same rate throughout the
motion.

Velocity as a function of time

This powerful expression enables us to determine an object’s velocity at any time
t if we know the object’s initial velocity and its (constant) acceleration. A
velocity – time graph for this constant-acceleration motion is shown in Figure
2.10a. The graph is a straight line, the (constant) slope of which is the acceleration
ax ; this is consistent with the fact that ax ⫽ dvx /dt is a constant. Note that the slope
is positive; this indicates a positive acceleration. If the acceleration were negative,
then the slope of the line in Figure 2.10a would be negative.
When the acceleration is constant, the graph of acceleration versus time (Fig.
2.10b) is a straight line having a slope of zero.

CHAPTER 2

Motion in One Dimension

Because velocity at constant acceleration varies linearly in time according to
Equation 2.8, we can express the average velocity in any time interval as the arithmetic mean of the initial velocity vxi and the ﬁnal velocity vx f :

v xi ⫹ v x f

(for constant ax )

(2.9)

Note that this expression for average velocity applies only in situations in which the
acceleration is constant.
We can now use Equations 2.1, 2.2, and 2.9 to obtain the displacement of any
object as a function of time. Recalling that ⌬x in Equation 2.2 represents xf ⫺ xi ,
and now using t in place of ⌬t (because we take ti ⫽ 0), we can say
xf ⫺ xi ⫽ v x t ⫽ 12(vxi ⫹ vx f )t

Displacement as a function of

We can obtain another useful expression for displacement at constant acceleration by substituting Equation 2.8 into Equation 2.10:

x f ⫺ x i ⫽ v xit ⫹ 12a x t 2

The position – time graph for motion at constant (positive) acceleration shown in
Figure 2.10c is obtained from Equation 2.11. Note that the curve is a parabola. The
slope of the tangent line to this curve at t ⫽ t i ⫽ 0 equals the initial velocity vxi , and
the slope of the tangent line at any later time t equals the velocity at that time, vx f .
We can check the validity of Equation 2.11 by moving the xi term to the righthand side of the equation and differentiating the equation with respect to time:

tion. Keep in mind that these relationships were derived from the deﬁnitions of
velocity and acceleration, together with some simple algebraic manipulations and
the requirement that the acceleration be constant.
The four kinematic equations used most often are listed in Table 2.2 for convenience. The choice of which equation you use in a given situation depends on
what you know beforehand. Sometimes it is necessary to use two of these equations
to solve for two unknowns. For example, suppose initial velocity vxi and acceleration ax are given. You can then ﬁnd (1) the velocity after an interval t has elapsed,
using v x f ⫽ v xi ⫹ a x t, and (2) the displacement after an interval t has elapsed, using x f ⫺ x i ⫽ v xi t ⫹ 12a x t 2. You should recognize that the quantities that vary during the motion are velocity, displacement, and time.
You will get a great deal of practice in the use of these equations by solving a
number of exercises and problems. Many times you will discover that more than
one method can be used to obtain a solution. Remember that these equations of
kinematics cannot be used in a situation in which the acceleration varies with time.
They can be used only when the acceleration is constant.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2.5

The Velocity of Different Objects
ﬁned as ⌬x/⌬t.) There is one point at which the instantaneous velocity is zero — at the top of the motion.

Consider the following one-dimensional motions: (a) A ball
thrown directly upward rises to a highest point and falls back
into the thrower’s hand. (b) A race car starts from rest and
speeds up to 100 m/s. (c) A spacecraft drifts through space at
constant velocity. Are there any points in the motion of these
objects at which the instantaneous velocity is the same as the
average velocity over the entire motion? If so, identify the
point(s).

(b) The car’s average velocity cannot be evaluated unambiguously with the information given, but it must be some value
between 0 and 100 m/s. Because the car will have every instantaneous velocity between 0 and 100 m/s at some time
during the interval, there must be some instant at which the
instantaneous velocity is equal to the average velocity.

Solution (a) The average velocity for the thrown ball is
zero because the ball returns to the starting point; thus its
displacement is zero. (Remember that average velocity is de-

(c) Because the spacecraft’s instantaneous velocity is constant, its instantaneous velocity at any time and its average velocity over any time interval are the same.

EXAMPLE 2.6

Entering the Trafﬁc Flow

(a) Estimate your average acceleration as you drive up the entrance ramp to an interstate highway.

Solution This problem involves more than our usual
amount of estimating! We are trying to come up with a value

of ax , but that value is hard to guess directly. The other three
variables involved in kinematics are position, velocity, and
time. Velocity is probably the easiest one to approximate. Let
us assume a ﬁnal velocity of 100 km/h, so that you can merge
with trafﬁc. We multiply this value by 1 000 to convert kilome-

38

CHAPTER 2

Motion in One Dimension

ters to meters and then divide by 3 600 to convert hours to
seconds. These two calculations together are roughly equivalent to dividing by 3. In fact, let us just say that the ﬁnal velocity is vx f ⬇ 30 m/s. (Remember, you can get away with this
type of approximation and with dropping digits when performing mental calculations. If you were starting with British
units, you could approximate 1 mi/h as roughly
0.5 m/s and continue from there.)
Now we assume that you started up the ramp at about onethird your ﬁnal velocity, so that vxi ⬇ 10 m/s. Finally, we assume that it takes about 10 s to get from vxi to vxf , basing this
guess on our previous experience in automobiles. We can
then ﬁnd the acceleration, using Equation 2.8:
ax ⫽

vxf ⫺ vxi
t

⬇

30 m/s ⫺ 10 m/s
⫽ 2 m/s2
10 s

Granted, we made many approximations along the way, but
this type of mental effort can be surprisingly useful and often

EXAMPLE 2.7

yields results that are not too different from those derived
from careful measurements.
(b) How far did you go during the ﬁrst half of the time interval during which you accelerated?

Solution We can calculate the distance traveled during
the ﬁrst 5 s from Equation 2.11:
x f ⫺ x i ⫽ v xi t ⫹ 12a x t 2 ⬇ (10 m/s)(5 s) ⫹ 12(2 m/s2)(5 s)2
⫽ 50 m ⫹ 25 m ⫽ 75 m
This result indicates that if you had not accelerated, your initial velocity of 10 m/s would have resulted in a 50-m movement up the ramp during the ﬁrst 5 s. The additional 25 m is
the result of your increasing velocity during that interval.
Do not be afraid to attempt making educated guesses and
doing some fairly drastic number rounding to simplify mental
calculations. Physicists engage in this type of thought analysis
all the time.

Carrier Landing

A jet lands on an aircraft carrier at 140 mi/h (⬇ 63 m/s).
(a) What is its acceleration if it stops in 2.0 s?

(b) What is the displacement of the plane while it is stopping?

Solution We deﬁne our x axis as the direction of motion
of the jet. A careful reading of the problem reveals that in addition to being given the initial speed of 63 m/s, we also
know that the ﬁnal speed is zero. We also note that we are
not given the displacement of the jet while it is slowing
down. Equation 2.8 is the only equation in Table 2.2 that does
not involve displacement, and so we use it to ﬁnd the acceleration:

Solution We can now use any of the other three equations
in Table 2.2 to solve for the displacement. Let us choose
Equation 2.10:

ax ⫽

vx f ⫺ vxi

If the plane travels much farther than this, it might fall into
the ocean. Although the idea of using arresting cables to enable planes to land safely on ships originated at about the
time of the First World War, the cables are still a vital part of
the operation of modern aircraft carriers.

Watch Out for the Speed Limit!

A car traveling at a constant speed of 45.0 m/s passes a
trooper hidden behind a billboard. One second after the
speeding car passes the billboard, the trooper sets out
from the billboard to catch it, accelerating at a constant
rate of 3.00 m/s2. How long does it take her to overtake the
car?

Solution A careful reading lets us categorize this as a constant-acceleration problem. We know that after the 1-s delay
in starting, it will take the trooper 15 additional seconds to
accelerate up to 45.0 m/s. Of course, she then has to continue to pick up speed (at a rate of 3.00 m/s per second) to

catch up to the car. While all this is going on, the car continues to move. We should therefore expect our result to be well
over 15 s. A sketch (Fig. 2.12) helps clarify the sequence of
events.
First, we write expressions for the position of each vehicle
as a function of time. It is convenient to choose the position
of the billboard as the origin and to set t B ⬅ 0 as the time the
trooper begins moving. At that instant, the car has already
traveled a distance of 45.0 m because it has traveled at a constant speed of vx ⫽ 45.0 m/s for 1 s. Thus, the initial position
of the speeding car is x B ⫽ 45.0 m.
Because the car moves with constant speed, its accelera-

FREELY FALLING OBJECTS

It is now well known that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects dropped
near the Earth’s surface fall toward the Earth with the same constant acceleration
under the inﬂuence of the Earth’s gravity. It was not until about 1600 that this
conclusion was accepted. Before that time, the teachings of the great philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 B.C.) had held that heavier objects fall faster than lighter
ones.
It was the Italian Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642) who originated our presentday ideas concerning falling objects. There is a legend that he demonstrated the
law of falling objects by observing that two different weights dropped simultaneously from the Leaning Tower of Pisa hit the ground at approximately the same
time. Although there is some doubt that he carried out this particular experiment, it is well established that Galileo performed many experiments on objects
moving on inclined planes. In his experiments he rolled balls down a slight incline and measured the distances they covered in successive time intervals. The
purpose of the incline was to reduce the acceleration; with the acceleration reduced, Galileo was able to make accurate measurements of the time intervals. By
gradually increasing the slope of the incline, he was finally able to draw conclusions about freely falling objects because a freely falling ball is equivalent to a
ball moving down a vertical incline.

CHAPTER 2

QuickLab

You might want to try the following experiment. Simultaneously drop a coin
and a crumpled-up piece of paper from the same height. If the effects of air resistance are negligible, both will have the same motion and will hit the ﬂoor at the
same time. In the idealized case, in which air resistance is absent, such motion is
referred to as free fall. If this same experiment could be conducted in a vacuum, in
which air resistance is truly negligible, the paper and coin would fall with the same
acceleration even when the paper is not crumpled. On August 2, 1971, such a
demonstration was conducted on the Moon by astronaut David Scott. He simultaneously released a hammer and a feather, and in unison they fell to the lunar surface. This demonstration surely would have pleased Galileo!
When we use the expression freely falling object, we do not necessarily refer to
an object dropped from rest. A freely falling object is any object moving
freely under the inﬂuence of gravity alone, regardless of its initial motion.
Objects thrown upward or downward and those released from rest are all
falling freely once they are released. Any freely falling object experiences
an acceleration directed downward, regardless of its initial motion.
We shall denote the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration by the symbol g. The
value of g near the Earth’s surface decreases with increasing altitude. Furthermore,
slight variations in g occur with changes in latitude. It is common to deﬁne “up” as
the ⫹ y direction and to use y as the position variable in the kinematic equations.
At the Earth’s surface, the value of g is approximately 9.80 m/s2. Unless stated
otherwise, we shall use this value for g when performing calculations. For making
quick estimates, use g ⫽ 10 m/s2.
If we neglect air resistance and assume that the free-fall acceleration does not
vary with altitude over short vertical distances, then the motion of a freely falling
object moving vertically is equivalent to motion in one dimension under constant
acceleration. Therefore, the equations developed in Section 2.5 for objects moving
with constant acceleration can be applied. The only modiﬁcation that we need to
make in these equations for freely falling objects is to note that the motion is in
the vertical direction (the y direction) rather than in the horizontal (x) direction
and that the acceleration is downward and has a magnitude of 9.80 m/s2. Thus, we
always take a y ⫽ ⫺g ⫽ ⫺9.80 m/s2, where the minus sign means that the acceleration of a freely falling object is downward. In Chapter 14 we shall study how to deal
with variations in g with altitude.

The Daring Sky Divers

A sky diver jumps out of a hovering helicopter. A few seconds
later, another sky diver jumps out, and they both fall along
the same vertical line. Ignore air resistance, so that both sky
divers fall with the same acceleration. Does the difference in
their speeds stay the same throughout the fall? Does the vertical distance between them stay the same throughout the fall?
If the two divers were connected by a long bungee cord,
would the tension in the cord increase, lessen, or stay the
same during the fall?

Solution At any given instant, the speeds of the divers are
different because one had a head start. In any time interval

⌬t after this instant, however, the two divers increase their
speeds by the same amount because they have the same acceleration. Thus, the difference in their speeds remains the
same throughout the fall.
The ﬁrst jumper always has a greater speed than the second. Thus, in a given time interval, the ﬁrst diver covers a
greater distance than the second. Thus, the separation distance between them increases.
Once the distance between the divers reaches the length
of the bungee cord, the tension in the cord begins to increase. As the tension increases, the distance between the
divers becomes greater and greater.

Freely Falling Objects

Describing the Motion of a Tossed Ball

A ball is tossed straight up at 25 m/s. Estimate its velocity at
1-s intervals.

Solution Let us choose the upward direction to be positive. Regardless of whether the ball is moving upward or
downward, its vertical velocity changes by approximately
⫺10 m/s for every second it remains in the air. It starts out at
25 m/s. After 1 s has elapsed, it is still moving upward but at
15 m/s because its acceleration is downward (downward acceleration causes its velocity to decrease). After another second, its upward velocity has dropped to 5 m/s. Now comes
the tricky part — after another half second, its velocity is zero.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2.11

The ball has gone as high as it will go. After the last half of
this 1-s interval, the ball is moving at ⫺ 5 m/s. (The minus
sign tells us that the ball is now moving in the negative direction, that is, downward. Its velocity has changed from ⫹5 m/s
to ⫺ 5 m/s during that 1-s interval. The change in velocity is
still ⫺5 ⫺ [⫹5] ⫽ ⫺10 m/s in that second.) It continues
downward, and after another 1 s has elapsed, it is falling at a
velocity of ⫺15 m/s. Finally, after another 1 s, it has reached
its original starting point and is moving downward at
⫺25 m/s. If the ball had been tossed vertically off a cliff so
that it could continue downward, its velocity would continue
to change by about ⫺10 m/s every second.

Follow the Bouncing Ball

A tennis ball is dropped from shoulder height (about 1.5 m)
and bounces three times before it is caught. Sketch graphs of
its position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time,
with the ⫹ y direction deﬁned as upward.

changes substantially during a very short time interval, and so
the acceleration must be quite great. This corresponds to the
very steep upward lines on the velocity – time graph and to
the spikes on the acceleration – time graph.

Solution

For our sketch let us stretch things out horizontally so that we can see what is going on. (Even if the ball
were moving horizontally, this motion would not affect its vertical motion.)
From Figure 2.13 we see that the ball is in contact with the
ﬂoor at points 훾, , and . Because the velocity of the ball
changes from negative to positive three times during these
bounces, the slope of the position – time graph must change
in the same way. Note that the time interval between bounces
decreases. Why is that?
During the rest of the ball’s motion, the slope of the
velocity – time graph should be ⫺ 9.80 m/s2. The acceleration – time graph is a horizontal line at these times because
the acceleration does not change when the ball is in free fall.
When the ball is in contact with the ﬂoor, the velocity

down, as shown in Figure 2.14. Using t A ⫽ 0 as the time the
stone leaves the thrower’s hand at position 훽, determine
(a) the time at which the stone reaches its maximum height,
(b) the maximum height, (c) the time at which the stone returns to the height from which it was thrown, (d) the velocity
of the stone at this instant, and (e) the velocity and position
of the stone at t ⫽ 5.00 s.
(a) As the stone travels from 훽 to 훾, its velocity
must change by 20 m/s because it stops at 훾. Because gravity
causes vertical velocities to change by about 10 m/s for every
second of free fall, it should take the stone about 2 s to go
from 훽 to 훾 in our drawing. (In a problem like this, a sketch
deﬁnitely helps you organize your thoughts.) To calculate the
time t B at which the stone reaches maximum height, we use
Equation 2.8, v y B ⫽ v y A ⫹ a y t, noting that vy B ⫽ 0 and setting
the start of our clock readings at t A ⬅ 0:

Solution

훾

tA = 0
yA = 0
vy A = 20.0 m/s

훽

t B = 2.04 s
y B = 20.4 m
vy B = 0

훿

t C = 4.08 s
yC = 0
vy C = –20.0 m/s



t D = 5.00 s
y D = –22.5 s
vy D = –29.0 m/s

t ⫽ tB ⫽

20.0 m/s
⫽ 2.04 s
9.80 m/s2

Our estimate was pretty close.

50.0 m

(b) Because the average velocity for this ﬁrst interval is
10 m/s (the average of 20 m/s and 0 m/s) and because it
travels for about 2 s, we expect the stone to travel about 20 m.
By substituting our time interval into Equation 2.11, we can
ﬁnd the maximum height as measured from the position of
the thrower, where we set y i ⫽ y A ⫽ 0:
y max ⫽ y B ⫽ v y A t ⫹ 12a y t 2
y B ⫽ (20.0 m/s)(2.04 s) ⫹ 12(⫺9.80 m/s2)(2.04 s)2
⫽ 20.4 m
Our free-fall estimates are very accurate.
(c) There is no reason to believe that the stone’s motion
from 훾 to 훿 is anything other than the reverse of its motion



t E = 5.83 s
y E = –50.0 m
vy E = –37.1 m/s

from 훽 to 훾. Thus, the time needed for it to go from 훽 to
훿 should be twice the time needed for it to go from 훽 to 훾.
When the stone is back at the height from which it was
thrown (position 훿), the y coordinate is again zero. Using
Equation 2.11, with y f ⫽ y C ⫽ 0 and y i ⫽ y A ⫽ 0, we obtain
y C ⫺ y A ⫽ v y A t ⫹ 12a y t 2
0 ⫽ 20.0t ⫺ 4.90t 2
This is a quadratic equation and so has two solutions for
t ⫽ t C . The equation can be factored to give

position . Because the elapsed time for this part of the
motion is about 3 s, we estimate that the acceleration due
to gravity will have changed the speed by about 30 m/s.
We can calculate this from Equation 2.8, where we take
t ⫽ tD ⫺ tB:
v y D ⫽ v y B ⫹ a y t ⫽ 0 m/s ⫹ (⫺9.80 m/s2)(5.00 s ⫺ 2.04 s)
⫽ ⫺29.0 m/s

t(20.0 ⫺ 4.90t) ⫽ 0

We could just as easily have made our calculation between
positions 훽 and  by making sure we use the correct time interval, t ⫽ t D ⫺ t A ⫽ 5.00 s:

One solution is t ⫽ 0, corresponding to the time the stone

v y D ⫽ v y A ⫹ a y t ⫽ 20.0 m/s ⫹ (⫺9.80 m/s2)(5.00 s)
⫽ ⫺29.0 m/s

starts its motion. The other solution is t ⫽ 4.08 s, which is
the solution we are after. Notice that it is double the value we
calculated for t B .
(d) Again, we expect everything at 훿 to be the same as it
is at 훽, except that the velocity is now in the opposite direction. The value for t found in (c) can be inserted into Equation 2.8 to give

To demonstrate the power of our kinematic equations, we
can use Equation 2.11 to ﬁnd the position of the stone at
t D ⫽ 5.00 s by considering the change in position between a
different pair of positions, 훿 and . In this case, the time is
tD ⫺ tC:
y D ⫽ y C ⫹ v y Ct ⫹ 12a y t 2
⫽ 0 m ⫹ (⫺20.0 m/s)(5.00 s ⫺ 4.08 s)

v y C ⫽ v y A ⫹ a y t ⫽ 20.0 m/s ⫹ (⫺9.80 m/s2)(4.08 s)

⫹ 12(⫺9.80 m/s2)(5.00 s ⫺ 4.08 s)2

⫽ ⫺20.0 m/s

⫽ ⫺22.5 m

The velocity of the stone when it arrives back at its original
height is equal in magnitude to its initial velocity but opposite in direction. This indicates that the motion is symmetric.

KINEMATIC EQUATIONS DERIVED FROM CALCULUS

This is an optional section that assumes the reader is familiar with the techniques
of integral calculus. If you have not yet studied integration in your calculus course,
you should skip this section or cover it after you become familiar with integration.
The velocity of a particle moving in a straight line can be obtained if its position
as a function of time is known. Mathematically, the velocity equals the derivative of
the position coordinate with respect to time. It is also possible to ﬁnd the displacement of a particle if its velocity is known as a function of time. In calculus, the procedure used to perform this task is referred to either as integration or as ﬁnding the
antiderivative. Graphically, it is equivalent to ﬁnding the area under a curve.
Suppose the vx -t graph for a particle moving along the x axis is as shown in
Figure 2.15. Let us divide the time interval t f ⫺ t i into many small intervals, each of
duration ⌬tn . From the deﬁnition of average velocity we see that the displacement
during any small interval, such as the one shaded in Figure 2.15, is given by
⌬x n ⫽ v xn ⌬t n , where v xn is the average velocity in that interval. Therefore, the displacement during this small interval is simply the area of the shaded rectangle.

Figure 2.15 Velocity versus time for a particle moving along the x axis. The area of the shaded
rectangle is equal to the displacement ⌬x in the time interval ⌬tn , while the total area under the
curve is the total displacement of the particle.

The total displacement for the interval t f ⫺ t i is the sum of the areas of all the rectangles:
⌬x ⫽ ⌺ v xn ⌬t n
n

where the symbol ⌺ (upper case Greek sigma) signiﬁes a sum over all terms. In
this case, the sum is taken over all the rectangles from t i to tf . Now, as the intervals
are made smaller and smaller, the number of terms in the sum increases and the
sum approaches a value equal to the area under the velocity – time graph. Therefore, in the limit n : ⬁, or ⌬t n : 0, the displacement is
⌬x ⫽ lim

⌺ vxn ⌬t n

⌬tn:0 n

(2.13)

or
Displacement ⫽ area under the vx -t graph
Note that we have replaced the average velocity v xn with the instantaneous velocity
vxn in the sum. As you can see from Figure 2.15, this approximation is clearly valid
in the limit of very small intervals. We conclude that if we know the vx -t graph for
motion along a straight line, we can obtain the displacement during any time interval by measuring the area under the curve corresponding to that time interval.
The limit of the sum shown in Equation 2.13 is called a deﬁnite integral and
is written

where vx(t) denotes the velocity at any time t. If the explicit functional form of
vx(t) is known and the limits are given, then the integral can be evaluated.
Sometimes the vx -t graph for a moving particle has a shape much simpler than
that shown in Figure 2.15. For example, suppose a particle moves at a constant ve-

and its displacement during the time interval ⌬t is simply the area of the shaded
rectangle:
⌬x ⫽ v xi ⌬t

(when v x f ⫽ v xi ⫽ constant)

As another example, consider a particle moving with a velocity that is proportional to t, as shown in Figure 2.17. Taking vx ⫽ a xt, where ax is the constant of proportionality (the acceleration), we ﬁnd that the displacement of the particle during the time interval t ⫽ 0 to t ⫽ t A is equal to the area of the shaded triangle in
Figure 2.17:
⌬x ⫽ 12(t A)(a xt A) ⫽ 12 a x t A2

Kinematic Equations
We now use the deﬁning equations for acceleration and velocity to derive two of
our kinematic equations, Equations 2.8 and 2.11.

where C1 is a constant of integration. For the special case in which the acceleration
is constant, the ax can be removed from the integral to give

The value of C1 depends on the initial conditions of the motion. If we take vx ⫽ vxi
when t ⫽ 0 and substitute these values into the last equation, we have
v xi ⫽ a x(0) ⫹ C1
C 1 ⫽ v xi
Calling vx ⫽ vx f the velocity after the time interval t has passed and substituting
this and the value just found for C1 into Equation 2.15, we obtain kinematic Equation 2.8:

(for constant ax )

Now let us consider the deﬁning equation for velocity (Eq. 2.4):

We can write this as dx ⫽ v x dt or in integral form as

To ﬁnd C 2 , we make use of the initial condition that x ⫽ x i when t ⫽ 0. This gives
C 2 ⫽ x i . Therefore, after substituting xf for x, we have
x f ⫽ x i ⫹ v xit ⫹ 12a x t 2

(for constant ax )

Once we move xi to the left side of the equation, we have kinematic Equation 2.11.
Recall that x f ⫺ x i is equal to the displacement of the object, where xi is its initial
position.

Besides what you might expect to learn about physics concepts, a very valuable skill
you should hope to take away from your physics course is the ability to solve complicated problems. The way physicists approach complex situations and break them
down into manageable pieces is extremely useful. We have developed a memory aid to
help you easily recall the steps required for successful problem solving. When working
on problems, the secret is to keep your GOAL in mind!

GOAL PROBLEM-SOLVING STEPS

Gather information
The ﬁrst thing to do when approaching a problem is to understand the situation.
Carefully read the problem statement, looking for key phrases like “at rest” or
“freely falls.” What information is given? Exactly what is the question asking? Don’t
forget to gather information from your own experiences and common sense. What
should a reasonable answer look like? You wouldn’t expect to calculate the speed
of an automobile to be 5 ⫻ 106 m/s. Do you know what units to expect? Are there
any limiting cases you can consider? What happens when an angle approaches 0°
or 90° or when a mass becomes huge or goes to zero? Also make sure you carefully
study any drawings that accompany the problem.

Organize your approach
Once you have a really good idea of what the problem is about, you need to think
about what to do next. Have you seen this type of question before? Being able to
classify a problem can make it much easier to lay out a plan to solve it. You should
almost always make a quick drawing of the situation. Label important events with
circled letters. Indicate any known values, perhaps in a table or directly on your
sketch.

Analyze the problem
Because you have already categorized the problem, it should not be too difﬁcult to
select relevant equations that apply to this type of situation. Use algebra (and calculus, if necessary) to solve for the unknown variable in terms of what is given.
Substitute in the appropriate numbers, calculate the result, and round it to the
proper number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Learn from your efforts
This is the most important part. Examine your numerical answer. Does it meet
your expectations from the ﬁrst step? What about the algebraic form of the result — before you plugged in numbers? Does it make sense? (Try looking at the
variables in it to see whether the answer would change in a physically meaningful
way if they were drastically increased or decreased or even became zero.) Think
about how this problem compares with others you have done. How was it similar?
In what critical ways did it differ? Why was this problem assigned? You should have
learned something by doing it. Can you ﬁgure out what?
When solving complex problems, you may need to identify a series of subproblems and apply the GOAL process to each. For very simple problems, you probably
don’t need GOAL at all. But when you are looking at a problem and you don’t
know what to do next, remember what the letters in GOAL stand for and use that
as a guide.

Motion in One Dimension

SUMMARY
After a particle moves along the x axis from some initial position xi to some ﬁnal
position xf , its displacement is
(2.1)
⌬x ⬅ x f ⫺ x i
The average velocity of a particle during some time interval is the displacement ⌬x divided by the time interval ⌬t during which that displacement occurred:
vx ⬅

⌬x
⌬t

(2.2)

The average speed of a particle is equal to the ratio of the total distance it
travels to the total time it takes to travel that distance.
The instantaneous velocity of a particle is deﬁned as the limit of the ratio
⌬x/⌬t as ⌬t approaches zero. By deﬁnition, this limit equals the derivative of x with
respect to t, or the time rate of change of the position:
vx ⬅ lim

⌬t:0

⌬x

(2.4)

The instantaneous speed of a particle is equal to the magnitude of its velocity.
The average acceleration of a particle is deﬁned as the ratio of the change in
its velocity ⌬vx divided by the time interval ⌬t during which that change occurred:

The instantaneous acceleration is equal to the limit of the ratio ⌬vx /⌬t as

The equations of kinematics for a particle moving along the x axis with uniform acceleration ax (constant in magnitude and direction) are
v x f ⫽ v xi ⫹ a x t

You should be able to use these equations and the deﬁnitions in this chapter to analyze the motion of any object moving with constant acceleration.
An object falling freely in the presence of the Earth’s gravity experiences a
free-fall acceleration directed toward the center of the Earth. If air resistance is neglected, if the motion occurs near the surface of the Earth, and if the range of the
motion is small compared with the Earth’s radius, then the free-fall acceleration g
is constant over the range of motion, where g is equal to 9.80 m/s2.
Complicated problems are best approached in an organized manner. You
should be able to recall and apply the steps of the GOAL strategy when you need
them.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
2.1 Your graph should look something like the one in (a).
This vx-t graph shows that the maximum speed is
about 5.0 m/s, which is 18 km/h (⫽ 11 mi/h), and
so the driver was not speeding. Can you derive the acceleration – time graph from the velocity – time graph? It
should look something like the one in (b).
2.2 (a) Yes. This occurs when the car is slowing down, so that
the direction of its acceleration is opposite the direction
of its motion. (b) Yes. If the motion is in the direction

chosen as negative, a positive acceleration causes a decrease in speed.
2.3 The left side represents the ﬁnal velocity of an object.
The ﬁrst term on the right side is the velocity that the object had initially when we started watching it. The second
term is the change in that initial velocity that is caused by
the acceleration. If this second term is positive, then the
initial velocity has increased (v xf ⬎ v x i ). If this term is negative, then the initial velocity has decreased (v xf ⬍ v x i ).

and subtraction of vector quantities, together with some common applications to
physical situations.
Vector quantities are used throughout this text, and it is therefore imperative
that you master both their graphical and their algebraic properties.

COORDINATE SYSTEMS

Many aspects of physics deal in some form or other with locations in space. In
Chapter 2, for example, we saw that the mathematical description of an object’s
motion requires a method for describing the object’s position at various times.
This description is accomplished with the use of coordinates, and in Chapter 2 we
used the cartesian coordinate system, in which horizontal and vertical axes intersect at a point taken to be the origin (Fig. 3.1). Cartesian coordinates are also
called rectangular coordinates.
Sometimes it is more convenient to represent a point in a plane by its plane polar coordinates (r, ), as shown in Figure 3.2a. In this polar coordinate system, r is the
distance from the origin to the point having cartesian coordinates (x, y), and  is
the angle between r and a ﬁxed axis. This ﬁxed axis is usually the positive x axis,
and  is usually measured counterclockwise from it. From the right triangle in Figure 3.2b, we ﬁnd that sin   y/r and that cos   x/r. (A review of trigonometric
functions is given in Appendix B.4.) Therefore, starting with the plane polar coordinates of any point, we can obtain the cartesian coordinates, using the equations

These four expressions relating the coordinates (x, y) to the coordinates (r, )

calculators perform conversions between cartesian and polar coordinates based on
these standard conventions.) If the reference axis for the polar angle  is chosen
to be one other than the positive x axis or if the sense of increasing  is chosen differently, then the expressions relating the two sets of coordinates will change.

VECTOR AND SCALAR QUANTITIES

As noted in Chapter 2, some physical quantities are scalar quantities whereas others are vector quantities. When you want to know the temperature outside so that
you will know how to dress, the only information you need is a number and the
unit “degrees C” or “degrees F.” Temperature is therefore an example of a scalar
quantity, which is deﬁned as a quantity that is completely speciﬁed by a number
and appropriate units. That is,
A scalar quantity is speciﬁed by a single value with an appropriate unit and has
no direction.

훾

Other examples of scalar quantities are volume, mass, and time intervals. The
rules of ordinary arithmetic are used to manipulate scalar quantities.
If you are getting ready to pilot a small plane and need to know the wind velocity, you must know both the speed of the wind and its direction. Because direction is part of the information it gives, velocity is a vector quantity, which is deﬁned as a physical quantity that is completely speciﬁed by a number and
appropriate units plus a direction. That is,
A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction.

훽

Figure 3.4 As a particle moves
from 훽 to 훾 along an arbitrary
path represented by the broken
line, its displacement is a vector
quantity shown by the arrow drawn
from 훽 to 훾.

Another example of a vector quantity is displacement, as you know from Chapter 2. Suppose a particle moves from some point 훽 to some point 훾 along a
straight path, as shown in Figure 3.4. We represent this displacement by drawing
an arrow from 훽 to 훾, with the tip of the arrow pointing away from the starting
point. The direction of the arrowhead represents the direction of the displacement, and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the displacement.
If the particle travels along some other path from 훽 to 훾, such as the broken line
in Figure 3.4, its displacement is still the arrow drawn from 훽 to 훾.

either A or 兩 A 兩. The magnitude of a vector has physical units, such as meters for
displacement or meters per second for velocity.

Equality of Two Vectors
For many purposes, two vectors A and B may be deﬁned to be equal if they have
the same magnitude and point in the same direction. That is, A  B only if A  B
and if A and B point in the same direction along parallel lines. For example, all
the vectors in Figure 3.5 are equal even though they have different starting points.
This property allows us to move a vector to a position parallel to itself in a diagram
without affecting the vector.

Figure 3.5 These four vectors are
equal because they have equal
lengths and point in the same direction.

Adding Vectors
2.4

The rules for adding vectors are conveniently described by geometric methods. To
add vector B to vector A, ﬁrst draw vector A, with its magnitude represented by a
convenient scale, on graph paper and then draw vector B to the same scale with its
tail starting from the tip of A, as shown in Figure 3.6. The resultant vector R 
A  B is the vector drawn from the tail of A to the tip of B. This procedure is
known as the triangle method of addition.
For example, if you walked 3.0 m toward the east and then 4.0 m toward the
north, as shown in Figure 3.7, you would ﬁnd yourself 5.0 m from where you

vector sum of the individual displacements.
A geometric construction can also be used to add more than two vectors. This
is shown in Figure 3.8 for the case of four vectors. The resultant vector R  A 
B  C  D is the vector that completes the polygon. In other words, R is the
vector drawn from the tail of the ﬁrst vector to the tip of the last vector.
An alternative graphical procedure for adding two vectors, known as the parallelogram rule of addition, is shown in Figure 3.9a. In this construction, the
tails of the two vectors A and B are joined together and the resultant vector R is
the diagonal of a parallelogram formed with A and B as two of its four sides.
When two vectors are added, the sum is independent of the order of the addition. (This fact may seem trivial, but as you will see in Chapter 11, the order is important when vectors are multiplied). This can be seen from the geometric construction in Figure 3.9b and is known as the commutative law of addition:
ABBA

Commutative law

Associative law

In summary, a vector quantity has both magnitude and direction and also
obeys the laws of vector addition as described in Figures 3.6 to 3.10. When two
or more vectors are added together, all of them must have the same units. It would
be meaningless to add a velocity vector (for example, 60 km/h to the east) to a displacement vector (for example, 200 km to the north) because they represent different physical quantities. The same rule also applies to scalars. For example, it
would be meaningless to add time intervals to temperatures.

Negative of a Vector
The negative of the vector A is deﬁned as the vector that when added to A gives
zero for the vector sum. That is, A  ( A)  0. The vectors A and  A have the
same magnitude but point in opposite directions.

Subtracting Vectors
The operation of vector subtraction makes use of the deﬁnition of the negative of
a vector. We deﬁne the operation A  B as vector  B added to vector A:
A  B  A  ( B)

(3.7)

The geometric construction for subtracting two vectors in this way is illustrated in
Figure 3.11a.
Another way of looking at vector subtraction is to note that the difference
A  B between two vectors A and B is what you have to add to the second vector
to obtain the ﬁrst. In this case, the vector A  B points from the tip of the second
vector to the tip of the ﬁrst, as Figure 3.11b shows.

subtract B from A, apply the rule of
vector addition to the combination
of A and  B: Draw A along some
convenient axis, place the tail of
 B at the tip of A, and C is the difference A  B. (b) A second way
of looking at vector subtraction.
The difference vector C  A  B is

A Vacation Trip

A car travels 20.0 km due north and then 35.0 km in a direction 60.0° west of north, as shown in Figure 3.12. Find the
magnitude and direction of the car’s resultant displacement.

Solution In this example, we show two ways to ﬁnd the resultant of two vectors. We can solve the problem geometrically, using graph paper and a protractor, as shown in Figure
3.12. (In fact, even when you know you are going to be carry-

ing out a calculation, you should sketch the vectors to check
your results.) The displacement R is the resultant when the
two individual displacements A and B are added.
To solve the problem algebraically, we note that the magnitude of R can be obtained from the law of cosines as applied
to the triangle (see Appendix B.4). With   180°  60° 
120° and R 2  A2  B 2  2AB cos , we ﬁnd that

If vector A is multiplied by a positive scalar quantity m, then the product mA is
a vector that has the same direction as A and magnitude mA. If vector A is
multiplied by a negative scalar quantity  m, then the product  mA is directed opposite A. For example, the vector 5A is ﬁve times as long as A and points in the
same direction as A; the vector  13 A is one-third the length of A and points in the
direction opposite A.

COMPONENTS OF A VECTOR AND UNIT VECTORS

The geometric method of adding vectors is not recommended whenever great accuracy is required or in three-dimensional problems. In this section, we describe a
method of adding vectors that makes use of the projections of vectors along coordinate axes. These projections are called the components of the vector. Any vector
can be completely described by its components.
Consider a vector A lying in the xy plane and making an arbitrary angle  with
the positive x axis, as shown in Figure 3.13. This vector can be expressed as the

3.4

65

Components of a Vector and Unit Vectors

sum of two other vectors A x and A y . From Figure 3.13, we see that the three vectors form a right triangle and that A  A x  A y . (If you cannot see why this equality holds, go back to Figure 3.9 and review the parallelogram rule.) We shall often
refer to the “components of a vector A,” written A x and A y (without the boldface
notation). The component A x represents the projection of A along the x axis, and
the component A y represents the projection of A along the y axis. These components can be positive or negative. The component A x is positive if A x points in the
positive x direction and is negative if A x points in the negative x direction. The
same is true for the component A y .
From Figure 3.13 and the deﬁnition of sine and cosine, we see that cos  
Ax /A and that sin   Ay /A. Hence, the components of A are
Ax  A cos

(3.8)

Ay  A sin

(3.9)

Components of the vector A

These components form two sides of a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length
A. Thus, it follows that the magnitude and direction of A are related to its components through the expressions

Note that the signs of the components Ax and Ay depend on the angle ␪.
For example, if   120°, then A x is negative and A y is positive. If   225°, then
both A x and A y are negative. Figure 3.14 summarizes the signs of the components
when A lies in the various quadrants.
When solving problems, you can specify a vector A either with its components
A x and A y or with its magnitude and direction A and .

Quick Quiz 3.3
Can the component of a vector ever be greater than the magnitude of the vector?

Suppose you are working a physics problem that requires resolving a vector
into its components. In many applications it is convenient to express the components in a coordinate system having axes that are not horizontal and vertical but are
still perpendicular to each other. If you choose reference axes or an angle other
than the axes and angle shown in Figure 3.13, the components must be modiﬁed
accordingly. Suppose a vector B makes an angle   with the x axis deﬁned in Figure 3.15. The components of B along the x and y axes are Bx  B cos   and
By  B sin  , as speciﬁed by Equations 3.8 and 3.9. The magnitude and direction
of B are obtained from expressions equivalent to Equations 3.10 and 3.11. Thus,
we can express the components of a vector in any coordinate system that is convenient for a particular situation.

Unit Vectors
Vector quantities often are expressed in terms of unit vectors. A unit vector is a
dimensionless vector having a magnitude of exactly 1. Unit vectors are used
to specify a given direction and have no other physical signiﬁcance. They are used
solely as a convenience in describing a direction in space. We shall use the symbols

i, j, and k to represent unit vectors pointing in the positive x, y, and z directions,
respectively. The unit vectors i, j, and k form a set of mutually perpendicular vectors in a right-handed coordinate system, as shown in Figure 3.16a. The magnitude
of each unit vector equals 1; that is, 兩 i 兩  兩 j 兩  兩 k 兩  1.
Consider a vector A lying in the xy plane, as shown in Figure 3.16b. The product of the component Ax and the unit vector i is the vector Ax i, which lies on the x
axis and has magnitude 兩 Ax 兩. (The vector Ax i is an alternative representation of
vector A x .) Likewise, A y j is a vector of magnitude 兩 Ay 兩 lying on the y axis. (Again,
vector A y j is an alternative representation of vector A y .) Thus, the unit – vector notation for the vector A is
A  Ax i  Ay j

(3.12)

For example, consider a point lying in the xy plane and having cartesian coordinates (x, y), as in Figure 3.17. The point can be speciﬁed by the position vector r,
which in unit – vector form is given by
r  xi  yj

Position vector

(3.13)

This notation tells us that the components of r are the lengths x and y.
Now let us see how to use components to add vectors when the geometric
method is not sufﬁciently accurate. Suppose we wish to add vector B to vector A,
where vector B has components Bx and By . All we do is add the x and y components separately. The resultant vector R  A  B is therefore
R  (Ax i  Ay j)  (Bx i  By j)

or
R  (Ax  Bx)i  (Ay  By)j

Because R  R x i  R y j, we see that the components of the resultant vector are

when using either the algebraic or the geometric method.
At times, we need to consider situations involving motion in three component directions. The extension of our methods to three-dimensional vectors is
straightforward. If A and B both have x, y, and z components, we express them in
the form

Problem-Solving Hints
Adding Vectors
When you need to add two or more vectors, use this step-by-step procedure:
• Select a coordinate system that is convenient. (Try to reduce the number of
components you need to ﬁnd by choosing axes that line up with as many
vectors as possible.)
• Draw a labeled sketch of the vectors described in the problem.
• Find the x and y components of all vectors and the resultant components
(the algebraic sum of the components) in the x and y directions.
• If necessary, use the Pythagorean theorem to ﬁnd the magnitude of the resultant vector and select a suitable trigonometric function to ﬁnd the angle
that the resultant vector makes with the x axis.

and

B  (2.0i  4.0j) m

Solution Comparing this expression for A with the general expression A  Ax i  Ay j, we see that Ax  2.0 m and
that Ay  2.0 m. Likewise, Bx  2.0 m and By  4.0 m. We
obtain the resultant vector R, using Equation 3.14:
R  A  B  (2.0  2.0)i m  (2.0  4.0)j m

mean 27° clockwise from the x axis. Our standard form has
been to quote the angles measured counterclockwise from
the  x axis, and that angle for this vector is   333°.

The Resultant Displacement

A particle undergoes three consecutive displacements: d1 

Let’s Fly Away!

A commuter airplane takes the route shown in Figure 3.20.
First, it ﬂies from the origin of the coordinate system shown
to city A, located 175 km in a direction 30.0° north of east.
Next, it ﬂies 153 km 20.0° west of north to city B. Finally, it
ﬂies 195 km due west to city C. Find the location of city C relative to the origin.

Solution

It is convenient to choose the coordinate system
shown in Figure 3.20, where the x axis points to the east and
the y axis points to the north. Let us denote the three consecutive displacements by the vectors a, b, and c. Displacement a
has a magnitude of 175 km and the components

Displacement b, whose magnitude is 153 km, has the components
bx  b cos(110°)  (153 km)(0.342)  52.3 km
by  b sin(110°)  (153 km)(0.940)  144 km
Finally, displacement c, whose magnitude is 195 km, has the
components
cx  c cos(180°)  (195 km)(1)  195 km
cy  c sin(180°)  0

a x  a cos(30.0°)  (175 km)(0.866)  152 km

Therefore, the components of the position vector R from the
starting point to city C are

a y  a sin(30.0°)  (175 km)(0.500)  87.5 km

Figure 3.22 The addition of the
two vectors Ax and Ay gives vector A.
Note that Ax  Ax i and Ay  A y j,
where Ax and Ay are the components of
vector A.

Scalar quantities are those that have only magnitude and no associated direction. Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction and obey the laws of
vector addition.
We can add two vectors A and B graphically, using either the triangle method
or the parallelogram rule. In the triangle method (Fig. 3.21a), the resultant vector
R  A  B runs from the tail of A to the tip of B. In the parallelogram method
(Fig. 3.21b), R is the diagonal of a parallelogram having A and B as two of its sides.
You should be able to add or subtract vectors, using these graphical methods.
The x component Ax of the vector A is equal to the projection of A along the x
axis of a coordinate system, as shown in Figure 3.22, where Ax  A cos . The y
component Ay of A is the projection of A along the y axis, where Ay  A sin . Be
sure you can determine which trigonometric functions you should use in all situations, especially when  is deﬁned as something other than the counterclockwise
angle from the positive x axis.
If a vector A has an x component Ax and a y component Ay , the vector can be
expressed in unit – vector form as A  Ax i  Ay j. In this notation, i is a unit vector
pointing in the positive x direction, and j is a unit vector pointing in the positive y
direction. Because i and j are unit vectors, 兩 i 兩  兩 j 兩  1.
We can ﬁnd the resultant of two or more vectors by resolving all vectors into
their x and y components, adding their resultant x and y components, and then
using the Pythagorean theorem to ﬁnd the magnitude of the resultant vector. We
can ﬁnd the angle that the resultant vector makes with respect to the x axis by using a suitable trigonometric function.

n this chapter we deal with the kinematics of a particle moving in two dimensions. Knowing the basics of two-dimensional motion will allow us to examine —
in future chapters — a wide variety of motions, ranging from the motion of satellites in orbit to the motion of electrons in a uniform electric ﬁeld. We begin by
studying in greater detail the vector nature of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. As in the case of one-dimensional motion, we derive the kinematic equations
for two-dimensional motion from the fundamental deﬁnitions of these three quantities. We then treat projectile motion and uniform circular motion as special cases
of motion in two dimensions. We also discuss the concept of relative motion,
which shows why observers in different frames of reference may measure different
displacements, velocities, and accelerations for a given particle.

In Chapter 2 we found that the motion of a particle moving along a straight line is
completely known if its position is known as a function of time. Now let us extend
this idea to motion in the xy plane. We begin by describing the position of a particle by its position vector r, drawn from the origin of some coordinate system to the
particle located in the xy plane, as in Figure 4.1. At time ti the particle is at point
훽, and at some later time tf it is at point 훾. The path from 훽 to 훾 is not necessarily a straight line. As the particle moves from 훽 to 훾 in the time interval
⌬t ⫽ t f ⫺ t i , its position vector changes from ri to rf . As we learned in Chapter 2,
displacement is a vector, and the displacement of the particle is the difference between its ﬁnal position and its initial position. We now formally deﬁne the displacement vector ⌬r for the particle of Figure 4.1 as being the difference between its ﬁnal position vector and its initial position vector:
⌬r ⬅ rf ⫺ ri
(4.1)

rf
O

Figure 4.1

Displacement vector

We deﬁne the average velocity of a particle during the time interval ⌬t as the
displacement of the particle divided by that time interval:
⌬r
⌬t

(4.2)

Multiplying or dividing a vector quantity by a scalar quantity changes only the magnitude of the vector, not its direction. Because displacement is a vector quantity
and the time interval is a scalar quantity, we conclude that the average velocity is a
vector quantity directed along ⌬r.
Note that the average velocity between points is independent of the path taken.
This is because average velocity is proportional to displacement, which depends

A particle moving in
the xy plane is located with the position vector r drawn from the origin to the particle. The displacement of the particle as it moves
from 훽 to 훾 in the time interval
⌬t ⫽ t f ⫺ ti is equal to the vector
⌬r ⫽ rf ⫺ ri .

The direction of ⌬r is indicated in Figure 4.1. As we see from the ﬁgure, the magnitude of ⌬r is less than the distance traveled along the curved path followed by
the particle.
As we saw in Chapter 2, it is often useful to quantify motion by looking at the
ratio of a displacement divided by the time interval during which that displacement occurred. In two-dimensional (or three-dimensional) kinematics, everything
is the same as in one-dimensional kinematics except that we must now use vectors
rather than plus and minus signs to indicate the direction of motion.

Figure 4.2 As a particle moves between two points, its average velocity is
in the direction of the displacement vector ⌬r. As the end point of the path is
moved from 훾 to 훾⬘ to 훾⬙, the respective displacements and corresponding
time intervals become smaller and
smaller. In the limit that the end point
approaches 훽, ⌬t approaches zero, and
the direction of ⌬r approaches that of
the line tangent to the curve at 훽. By
deﬁnition, the instantaneous velocity at
훽 is in the direction of this tangent
line.

only on the initial and ﬁnal position vectors and not on the path taken. As we did
with one-dimensional motion, we conclude that if a particle starts its motion at
some point and returns to this point via any path, its average velocity is zero for
this trip because its displacement is zero.
Consider again the motion of a particle between two points in the xy plane, as
shown in Figure 4.2. As the time interval over which we observe the motion becomes smaller and smaller, the direction of the displacement approaches that of
the line tangent to the path at 훽.

That is, the instantaneous velocity equals the derivative of the position vector with

particle’s path is along a line tangent to the path at that point and in the direction
of motion (Fig. 4.3).
The magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector v ⫽ 兩 v 兩 is called the speed,
which, as you should remember, is a scalar quantity.

Two-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration

As a particle moves from one point to another along some path, its instantaneous velocity vector changes from vi at time ti to vf at time tf . Knowing the velocity at these points allows us to determine the average acceleration of the particle:
The average acceleration of a particle as it moves from one position to another is deﬁned as the change in the instantaneous velocity vector ⌬v divided by
the time ⌬t during which that change occurred:

(4.4)

Average acceleration

Because it is the ratio of a vector quantity ⌬v and a scalar quantity ⌬t, we conclude
that average acceleration a is a vector quantity directed along ⌬v. As indicated in
Figure 4.3, the direction of ⌬v is found by adding the vector ⫺ vi (the negative of
vi ) to the vector vf , because by deﬁnition ⌬v ⫽ vf ⫺ vi .
When the average acceleration of a particle changes during different time intervals, it is useful to deﬁne its instantaneous acceleration a:
The instantaneous acceleration a is deﬁned as the limiting value of the ratio
⌬v/⌬t as ⌬t approaches zero:
a ⬅ lim

⌬t:0

In other words, the instantaneous acceleration equals the derivative of the velocity
vector with respect to time.
It is important to recognize that various changes can occur when a particle accelerates. First, the magnitude of the velocity vector (the speed) may change with
time as in straight-line (one-dimensional) motion. Second, the direction of the velocity vector may change with time even if its magnitude (speed) remains constant,
as in curved-path (two-dimensional) motion. Finally, both the magnitude and the
direction of the velocity vector may change simultaneously.

Let us consider two-dimensional motion during which the acceleration remains

The position vector for a particle moving in the xy plane can be written

(4.6)

where x, y, and r change with time as the particle moves while i and j remain constant. If the position vector is known, the velocity of the particle can be obtained
from Equations 4.3 and 4.6, which give

CHAPTER 4

Motion in Two Dimensions

Because a is assumed constant, its components ax and ay also are constants. Therefore, we can apply the equations of kinematics to the x and y components of the
velocity vector. Substituting vx f ⫽ vxi ⫹ a x t and vy f ⫽ vyi ⫹ a y t into Equation 4.7 to
determine the ﬁnal velocity at any time t, we obtain
vf ⫽ (v xi ⫹ a x t)i ⫹ (v yi ⫹ a y t)j
⫽ (v xi i ⫹ v yi j) ⫹ (a x i ⫹ a y j)t
vf ⫽ vi ⫹ at

Velocity vector as a function of time

(4.8)

This result states that the velocity of a particle at some time t equals the vector sum
of its initial velocity vi and the additional velocity at acquired in the time t as a result of constant acceleration.
Similarly, from Equation 2.11 we know that the x and y coordinates of a particle moving with constant acceleration are
x f ⫽ x i ⫹ v xit ⫹ 12a xt 2

Position vector as a function of
time

y f ⫽ y i ⫹ v yit ⫹ 12a yt 2

Substituting these expressions into Equation 4.6 (and labeling the ﬁnal position
vector rf ) gives

This equation tells us that the displacement vector ⌬r ⫽ rf ⫺ ri is the vector sum
of a displacement vi t arising from the initial velocity of the particle and a displacement 12at 2 resulting from the uniform acceleration of the particle.
Graphical representations of Equations 4.8 and 4.9 are shown in Figure 4.4.
For simplicity in drawing the ﬁgure, we have taken ri ⫽ 0 in Figure 4.4a. That is,
we assume the particle is at the origin at t ⫽ t i ⫽ 0. Note from Figure 4.4a that rf is
generally not along the direction of either vi or a because the relationship between these quantities is a vector expression. For the same reason, from Figure
4.4b we see that vf is generally not along the direction of vi or a. Finally, note that
vf and rf are generally not in the same direction.

These components are illustrated in Figure 4.4. The component form of the equations for vf and rf show us that two-dimensional motion at constant acceleration is
equivalent to two independent motions — one in the x direction and one in the y direction — having constant accelerations ax and ay .

EXAMPLE 4.1

Motion in a Plane

A particle starts from the origin at t ⫽ 0 with an initial velocity having an x component of 20 m/s and a y component of
⫺ 15 m/s. The particle moves in the xy plane with an x component of acceleration only, given by ax ⫽ 4.0 m/s2. (a) Determine the components of the velocity vector at any time
and the total velocity vector at any time.

Solution After carefully reading the problem, we realize
we can set vxi ⫽ 20 m/s, vyi ⫽ ⫺ 15 m/s, ax ⫽ 4.0 m/s2, and
ay ⫽ 0. This allows us to sketch a rough motion diagram of
the situation. The x component of velocity starts at 20 m/s
and increases by 4.0 m/s every second. The y component of
velocity never changes from its initial value of ⫺ 15 m/s.
From this information we sketch some velocity vectors as
shown in Figure 4.5. Note that the spacing between successive
images increases as time goes on because the velocity is increasing.
The equations of kinematics give
v x f ⫽ v xi ⫹ a xt ⫽ (20 ⫹ 4.0t) m/s

We could also obtain this result using Equation 4.8 directly, noting that a ⫽ 4.0i m/s2 and vi ⫽ (20i ⫺ 15j) m/s.
According to this result, the x component of velocity increases while the y component remains constant; this is consistent with what we predicted. After a long time, the x component will be so great that the y component will be
negligible. If we were to extend the object’s path in Figure
4.5, eventually it would become nearly parallel to the x axis. It
is always helpful to make comparisons between ﬁnal answers
and initial stated conditions.
(b) Calculate the velocity and speed of the particle at t ⫽
5.0 s.

Solution

With t ⫽ 5.0 s, the result from part (a) gives

vf ⫽ {[20 ⫹ 4.0(5.0)]i ⫺ 15j} m/s ⫽ (40i ⫺ 15j) m/s
This result tells us that at t ⫽ 5.0 s, vxf ⫽ 40 m/s and vyf ⫽
⫺ 15 m/s. Knowing these two components for this twodimensional motion, we can ﬁnd both the direction and the
magnitude of the velocity vector. To determine the angle ␪
that v makes with the x axis at t ⫽ 5.0 s, we use the fact that
tan ␪ ⫽ vyf /vxf :

v y f ⫽ v yi ⫹ a y t ⫽ ⫺15 m/s ⫹ 0 ⫽ ⫺15 m/s
Therefore,

(Alternatively, we could obtain rf by applying Equation 4.9 directly, with vi ⫽ (20i ⫺ 15j) m/s and a ⫽ 4.0i m/s2. Try it!)
Thus, for example, at t ⫽ 5.0 s, x ⫽ 150 m, y ⫽ ⫺ 75 m, and
rf ⫽ (150i ⫺ 75j) m. The magnitude of the displacement of
the particle from the origin at t ⫽ 5.0 s is the magnitude of rf
at this time:

Note that this is not the distance that the particle travels in
this time! Can you determine this distance from the available
data?

PROJECTILE MOTION

Anyone who has observed a baseball in motion (or, for that matter, any other object thrown into the air) has observed projectile motion. The ball moves in a
curved path, and its motion is simple to analyze if we make two assumptions:
(1) the free-fall acceleration g is constant over the range of motion and is directed
downward,1 and (2) the effect of air resistance is negligible.2 With these assumptions, we ﬁnd that the path of a projectile, which we call its trajectory, is always a
parabola. We use these assumptions throughout this chapter.
To show that the trajectory of a projectile is a parabola, let us choose our reference frame such that the y direction is vertical and positive is upward. Because air
resistance is neglected, we know that a y ⫽ ⫺g (as in one-dimensional free fall)
and that a x ⫽ 0. Furthermore, let us assume that at t ⫽ 0, the projectile leaves the
origin (x i ⫽ y i ⫽ 0) with speed vi , as shown in Figure 4.6. The vector vi makes an
angle ␪i with the horizontal, where ␪i is the angle at which the projectile leaves the
origin. From the deﬁnitions of the cosine and sine functions we have

Assumptions of projectile motion

Therefore, the initial x and y components of velocity are

Horizontal position component

v yi ⫽ v i sin ␪i

Substituting the x component into Equation 4.9a with xi ⫽ 0 and ax ⫽ 0, we ﬁnd
that

(4.10)
Repeating with the y component and using yi ⫽ 0 and ay ⫽ ⫺ g, we obtain

This assumption is reasonable as long as the range of motion is small compared with the radius of the
Earth (6.4 ⫻ 106 m). In effect, this assumption is equivalent to assuming that the Earth is ﬂat over the
range of motion considered.
2

This assumption is generally not justiﬁed, especially at high velocities. In addition, any spin imparted
to a projectile, such as that applied when a pitcher throws a curve ball, can give rise to some very interesting effects associated with aerodynamic forces, which will be discussed in Chapter 15.

Figure 4.6 The parabolic path of a projectile that leaves the origin with a velocity vi . The velocity vector v changes with time in both magnitude and direction. This change is the result of acceleration in the negative y direction. The x component of velocity remains constant in time because there is no acceleration along the horizontal direction. The y component of velocity is zero
at the peak of the path.
This equation is valid for launch angles in the range 0 ⬍ ␪i ⬍ ␲/2. We have left
the subscripts off the x and y because the equation is valid for any point (x, y)
along the path of the projectile. The equation is of the form y ⫽ ax ⫺ bx 2, which is
the equation of a parabola that passes through the origin. Thus, we have shown
that the trajectory of a projectile is a parabola. Note that the trajectory is completely speciﬁed if both the initial speed vi and the launch angle ␪i are known.
The vector expression for the position vector of the projectile as a function of
time follows directly from Equation 4.9, with ri ⫽ 0 and a ⫽ g:

CHAPTER 4

Motion in Two Dimensions

Multiﬂash exposure of a tennis
player executing a forehand swing.
Note that the ball follows a parabolic path characteristic of a projectile. Such photographs can be
used to study the quality of sports
equipment and the performance of
an athlete.

It is interesting to realize that the motion of a particle can be considered the
superposition of the term vi t, the displacement if no acceleration were present,
and the term 12 gt 2, which arises from the acceleration due to gravity. In other
words, if there were no gravitational acceleration, the particle would continue to
move along a straight path in the direction of vi . Therefore, the vertical distance
1
2
2 gt through which the particle “falls” off the straight-line path is the same distance that a freely falling body would fall during the same time interval. We conclude that projectile motion is the superposition of two motions: (1) constant-velocity motion in the horizontal direction and (2) free-fall motion in
the vertical direction. Except for t, the time of ﬂight, the horizontal and vertical
components of a projectile’s motion are completely independent of each other.

EXAMPLE 4.2

Approximating Projectile Motion

A ball is thrown in such a way that its initial vertical and horizontal components of velocity are 40 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively. Estimate the total time of ﬂight and the distance
the ball is from its starting point when it lands.

Solution We start by remembering that the two velocity
components are independent of each other. By considering
the vertical motion ﬁrst, we can determine how long the ball
remains in the air. Then, we can use the time of ﬂight to estimate the horizontal distance covered.
A motion diagram like Figure 4.8 helps us organize what
we know about the problem. The acceleration vectors are all
the same, pointing downward with a magnitude of nearly
10 m/s2. The velocity vectors change direction. Their hori-

zontal components are all the same: 20 m/s. Because the vertical motion is free fall, the vertical components of the velocity vectors change, second by second, from 40 m/s to roughly
30, 20, and 10 m/s in the upward direction, and then to
0 m/s. Subsequently, its velocity becomes 10, 20, 30, and
40 m/s in the downward direction. Thus it takes the ball

85

Projectile Motion

about 4 s to go up and another 4 s to come back down, for a
total time of ﬂight of approximately 8 s. Because the horizontal component of velocity is 20 m/s, and because the ball
travels at this speed for 8 s, it ends up approximately 160 m
from its starting point.

Horizontal Range and Maximum Height of a Projectile
Let us assume that a projectile is ﬁred from the origin at ti ⫽ 0 with a positive vyi component, as shown in Figure 4.9. Two points are especially interesting to analyze: the
peak point 훽, which has cartesian coordinates (R/2, h), and the point 훾, which has
coordinates (R, 0). The distance R is called the horizontal range of the projectile, and
the distance h is its maximum height. Let us ﬁnd h and R in terms of vi , ␪i , and g.
We can determine h by noting that at the peak, vy A ⫽ 0. Therefore, we can use
Equation 4.8a to determine the time t A it takes the projectile to reach the peak:

noting that vxi ⫽ vx B ⫽ vi cos ␪i , and setting R ⬅ x B at t ⫽ 2t A , we ﬁnd that

only if vi and ␪i are known (which means that only vi has to be speciﬁed) and if
the projectile lands at the same height from which it started, as it does in Figure 4.9.
The maximum value of R from Equation 4.14 is R max ⫽ v i2/g. This result follows from the fact that the maximum value of sin 2␪i is 1, which occurs when 2␪i ⫽

To carry out this investigation, you
need to be outdoors with a small ball,
such as a tennis ball, as well as a wristwatch. Throw the ball straight up as
hard as you can and determine the
initial speed of your throw and the
approximate maximum height of the
ball, using only your watch. What
happens when you throw the ball at
some angle ␪ ⫽ 90°? Does this
change the time of ﬂight (perhaps
because it is easier to throw)? Can
you still determine the maximum
height and initial speed?

Figure 4.10 illustrates various trajectories for a projectile having a given initial
speed but launched at different angles. As you can see, the range is a maximum
for ␪i ⫽ 45°. In addition, for any ␪i other than 45°, a point having cartesian coordinates (R, 0) can be reached by using either one of two complementary values of ␪i ,
such as 75° and 15°. Of course, the maximum height and time of ﬂight for one of
these values of ␪i are different from the maximum height and time of ﬂight for the
complementary value.

Problem-Solving Hints
Projectile Motion
We suggest that you use the following approach to solving projectile motion
problems:
• Select a coordinate system and resolve the initial velocity vector into x and y
components.
• Follow the techniques for solving constant-velocity problems to analyze the
horizontal motion. Follow the techniques for solving constant-acceleration
problems to analyze the vertical motion. The x and y motions share the
same time of ﬂight t.

The Long-Jump

A long-jumper leaves the ground at an angle of 20.0° above
the horizontal and at a speed of 11.0 m/s. (a) How far does
he jump in the horizontal direction? (Assume his motion is
equivalent to that of a particle.)

Solution

Because the initial speed and launch angle are
given, the most direct way of solving this problem is to use
the range formula given by Equation 4.14. However, it is
more instructive to take a more general approach and use
Figure 4.9. As before, we set our origin of coordinates at the

takeoff point and label the peak as 훽 and the landing point
as 훾. The horizontal motion is described by Equation 4.10:
x f ⫽ x B ⫽ (v i cos ␪ i)t B ⫽ (11.0 m/s)(cos 20.0°)t B
The value of x B can be found if the total time of the jump
is known. We are able to ﬁnd t B by remembering that
a y ⫽ ⫺g and by using the y part of Equation 4.8a. We also
note that at the top of the jump the vertical component of velocity vy A is zero:
v y f ⫽ v y A ⫽ v i sin ␪ i ⫺ gt A
0 ⫽ (11.0 m/s) sin 20.0° ⫺ (9.80 m/s2)t A
t A ⫽ 0.384 s
This is the time needed to reach the top of the jump. Because of the symmetry of the vertical motion, an identical
time interval passes before the jumper returns to the ground.
Therefore, the total time in the air is t B ⫽ 2t A ⫽ 0.768 s. Substituting this value into the above expression for xf gives
x f ⫽ x B ⫽ (11.0 m/s)(cos 20.0°)(0.768 s) ⫽ 7.94 m
This is a reasonable distance for a world-class athlete.
(b) What is the maximum height reached?

Solution

We ﬁnd the maximum height reached by using
Equation 4.11:
y max ⫽ y A ⫽ (v i sin ␪ i)t A ⫺ 12gt A2
⫽ (11.0 m/s)(sin 20.0°)(0.384 s)
⫺ 12(9.80 m/s2)(0.384 s)2
⫽ 0.722 m
Treating the long-jumper as a particle is an oversimpliﬁcation. Nevertheless, the values obtained are reasonable.

In a long-jump event, 1993 United States champion Mike Powell
can leap horizontal distances of at least 8 m.

above the ﬂoor. If vi sin ␪i is less than this value, the projectile
will strike the ﬂoor before reaching the target.

The Stranded Explorers

An Alaskan rescue plane drops a package of emergency rations to a stranded party of explorers, as shown in Figure
4.13. If the plane is traveling horizontally at 40.0 m/s and is
100 m above the ground, where does the package strike the
ground relative to the point at which it was released?

Solution For this problem we choose the coordinate system shown in Figure 4.13, in which the origin is at the point
of release of the package. Consider ﬁrst the horizontal motion of the package. The only equation available to us for
ﬁnding the distance traveled along the horizontal direction is
x f ⫽ v xi t (Eq. 4.9a). The initial x component of the package

velocity is the same as that of the plane when the package is
released: 40.0 m/s. Thus, we have
x f ⫽ (40.0 m/s)t
If we know t, the length of time the package is in the air,
then we can determine xf , the distance the package travels in
the horizontal direction. To ﬁnd t, we use the equations that
describe the vertical motion of the package. We know that at
the instant the package hits the ground, its y coordinate is
y f ⫽ ⫺100 m. We also know that the initial vertical component of the package velocity vyi is zero because at the moment of release, the package had only a horizontal component of velocity.
From Equation 4.9a, we have

Substitution of this value for the time of ﬂight into the
equation for the x coordinate gives

The package hits the ground 181 m to the right of the drop
point.

The End of the Ski Jump

A ski jumper leaves the ski track moving in the horizontal direction with a speed of 25.0 m/s, as shown in Figure 4.14.
The landing incline below him falls off with a slope of 35.0°.
Where does he land on the incline?

Solution It is reasonable to expect the skier to be airborne for less than 10 s, and so he will not go farther than
250 m horizontally. We should expect the value of d, the distance traveled along the incline, to be of the same order of
magnitude. It is convenient to select the beginning of the
jump as the origin (x i ⫽ 0, y i ⫽ 0). Because v xi ⫽ 25.0 m/s
and v yi ⫽ 0, the x and y component forms of Equation 4.9a
are
(1)

x f ⫽ v xi t ⫽ (25.0 m/s)t

(2)

y f ⫽ 12a y t 2 ⫽ ⫺ 12(9.80 m/s2)t 2

d cos 35.0° ⫽ (25.0 m/s)t

(4)

⫺ d sin 35.0° ⫽ ⫺ 12(9.80 m/s2)t 2

Solving (3) for t and substituting the result into (4), we ﬁnd
that d ⫽ 109 m. Hence, the x and y coordinates of the point
at which he lands are
x f ⫽ d cos 35.0° ⫽ (109 m) cos 35.0° ⫽ 89.3 m
y f ⫽ ⫺d sin 35.0° ⫽ ⫺(109 m) sin 35.0° ⫽ ⫺62.5 m

What would have occurred if the skier in the last example happened to be carrying a stone and let go of it while in midair? Because the stone has the same initial velocity as the skier, it will stay near him as he moves — that is, it ﬂoats alongside him. This is a technique that NASA uses to train astronauts. The plane
pictured at the beginning of the chapter ﬂies in the same type of projectile path

UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

Figure 4.16a shows a car moving in a circular path with constant linear speed v.
Such motion is called uniform circular motion. Because the car’s direction of motion changes, the car has an acceleration, as we learned in Section 4.1. For any motion, the velocity vector is tangent to the path. Consequently, when an object moves
in a circular path, its velocity vector is perpendicular to the radius of the circle.
We now show that the acceleration vector in uniform circular motion is always
perpendicular to the path and always points toward the center of the circle. An ac-

celeration of this nature is called a centripetal (center-seeking) acceleration, and
its magnitude is
ar ⫽

v2
r

(4.15)

where r is the radius of the circle and the notation ar is used to indicate that the
centripetal acceleration is along the radial direction.
To derive Equation 4.15, consider Figure 4.16b, which shows a particle ﬁrst at
point 훽 and then at point 훾. The particle is at 훽 at time ti , and its velocity at that
time is vi . It is at 훾 at some later time tf , and its velocity at that time is vf . Let us assume here that vi and vf differ only in direction; their magnitudes (speeds) are the
same (that is, v i ⫽ v f ⫽ v). To calculate the acceleration of the particle, let us begin with the deﬁning equation for average acceleration (Eq. 4.4):
a⫽

vf ⫺ vi
tf ⫺ ti

⫽

⌬v
⌬t

This equation indicates that we must subtract vi from vf , being sure to treat them
as vectors, where ⌬v ⫽ vf ⫺ vi is the change in the velocity. Because vi ⫹ ⌬v ⫽ vf ,
we can ﬁnd the vector ⌬v, using the vector triangle in Figure 4.16c.
Now consider the triangle in Figure 4.16b, which has sides ⌬r and r. This triangle and the one in Figure 4.16c, which has sides ⌬v and v, are similar. This fact enables us to write a relationship between the lengths of the sides:
⌬v
⌬r
⫽
v
r
This equation can be solved for ⌬v and the expression so obtained substituted into
a ⫽ ⌬v/⌬t (Eq. 4.4) to give
a⫽

v ⌬r
r ⌬t

Now imagine that points 훽 and 훾 in Figure 4.16b are extremely close together. In this case ⌬v points toward the center of the circular path, and because
the acceleration is in the direction of ⌬v, it too points toward the center. Furthermore, as 훽 and 훾 approach each other, ⌬t approaches zero, and the ratio ⌬r/⌬t
approaches the speed v. Hence, in the limit ⌬t : 0, the magnitude of the acceleration is
ar ⫽

v2
r

Thus, we conclude that in uniform circular motion, the acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle and has a magnitude given by v 2/r, where v is the
speed of the particle and r is the radius of the circle. You should be able to show
that the dimensions of a r are L/T 2. We shall return to the discussion of circular
motion in Section 6.1.

TANGENTIAL AND RADIAL ACCELERATION

Now let us consider a particle moving along a curved path where the velocity
changes both in direction and in magnitude, as shown in Figure 4.17. As is always
the case, the velocity vector is tangent to the path, but now the direction of the ac-

Figure 4.17 The motion of a particle along an arbitrary curved path lying in the xy plane. If
the velocity vector v (always tangent to the path) changes in direction and magnitude, the component vectors of the acceleration a are a tangential component a t and a radial component ar .
celeration vector a changes from point to point. This vector can be resolved into
two component vectors: a radial component vector ar and a tangential component
vector at . Thus, a can be written as the vector sum of these component vectors:

is parallel to the instantaneous velocity, and its magnitude is

The radial acceleration arises from the change in direction of the velocity
vector as described earlier and has an absolute magnitude given by
ar ⫽

(4.18)

where r is the radius of curvature of the path at the point in question. Because ar
and at are mutually perpendicular component vectors of a, it follows that
a ⫽ √a r2 ⫹ a t2 . As in the case of uniform circular motion, ar in nonuniform circular motion always points toward the center of curvature, as shown in Figure 4.17.
Also, at a given speed, ar is large when the radius of curvature is small (as at points
훽 and 훾 in Figure 4.17) and small when r is large (such as at point 훿). The direction of at is either in the same direction as v (if v is increasing) or opposite v (if v
is decreasing).
In uniform circular motion, where v is constant, at ⫽ 0 and the acceleration is
always completely radial, as we described in Section 4.4. (Note: Eq. 4.18 is identical
to Eq. 4.15.) In other words, uniform circular motion is a special case of motion
along a curved path. Furthermore, if the direction of v does not change, then
there is no radial acceleration and the motion is one-dimensional (in this case,
ar ⫽ 0, but at may not be zero).

counterclockwise from the positive x axis. Note that both r̂ and ␪ˆ “move along with

RELATIVE VELOCITY AND RELATIVE ACCELERATION

In this section, we describe how observations made by different observers in different frames of reference are related to each other. We ﬁnd that observers in different frames of reference may measure different displacements, velocities, and accelerations for a given particle. That is, two observers moving relative to each other
generally do not agree on the outcome of a measurement.
For example, suppose two cars are moving in the same direction with speeds
of 50 mi/h and 60 mi/h. To a passenger in the slower car, the speed of the faster
car is 10 mi/h. Of course, a stationary observer will measure the speed of the faster
car to be 60 mi/h, not 10 mi/h. Which observer is correct? They both are! This
simple example demonstrates that the velocity of an object depends on the frame
of reference in which it is measured.
Suppose a person riding on a skateboard (observer A) throws a ball in such a
way that it appears in this person’s frame of reference to move ﬁrst straight upward
and then straight downward along the same vertical line, as shown in Figure 4.20a.
A stationary observer B sees the path of the ball as a parabola, as illustrated in Figure 4.20b. Relative to observer B, the ball has a vertical component of velocity (resulting from the initial upward velocity and the downward acceleration of gravity)
and a horizontal component.
Another example of this concept that of is a package dropped from an airplane ﬂying with a constant velocity; this is the situation we studied in Example
4.6. An observer on the airplane sees the motion of the package as a straight line
toward the Earth. The stranded explorer on the ground, however, sees the trajectory of the package as a parabola. If, once it drops the package, the airplane con-

ground directly beneath the airplane (if we assume that air resistance is neglected)!
In a more general situation, consider a particle located at point 훽 in Figure
4.21. Imagine that the motion of this particle is being described by two observers,
one in reference frame S, ﬁxed relative to the Earth, and another in reference
frame S⬘, moving to the right relative to S (and therefore relative to the Earth)
with a constant velocity v0 . (Relative to an observer in S⬘, S moves to the left with a
velocity ⫺ v0 .) Where an observer stands in a reference frame is irrelevant in this
discussion, but for purposes of this discussion let us place each observer at her or
his respective origin.
We label the position of the particle relative to the S frame with the position
vector r and that relative to the S⬘ frame with the position vector rⴕ, both after
some time t. The vectors r and rⴕ are related to each other through the expression

That is, after a time t, the S⬘ frame is displaced to the right of the S frame by an

where vⴕ is the velocity of the particle observed in the S⬘ frame and v is its velocity

with uniform motion relative to the Earth.
Although observers in two frames measure different velocities for the particle,
they measure the same acceleration when v0 is constant. We can verify this by taking
the time derivative of Equation 4.21:

A Boat Crossing a River

A boat heading due north crosses a wide river with a speed of
10.0 km/h relative to the water. The water in the river has a uniform speed of 5.00 km/h due east relative to the Earth. Determine the velocity of the boat relative to an observer standing on

Solution

We know vbr , the velocity of the boat relative to

The terms in the equation must be manipulated as vector

vbr is due north, vrE is due east, and the vector sum of the

EXAMPLE 4.10

Which Way Should We Head?

If the boat of the preceding example travels with the same
speed of 10.0 km/h relative to the river and is to travel
due north, as shown in Figure 4.23, what should its heading
be?

Exercise

If the width of the river is 3.0 km, ﬁnd the time it
takes the boat to cross it.

Answer

21 min.

Solution

As in the previous example, we know vrE and the
magnitude of the vector vbr , and we want vbE to be directed
across the river. Figure 4.23 shows that the boat must head
upstream in order to travel directly northward across the
river. Note the difference between the triangle in Figure 4.22
and the one in Figure 4.23 — speciﬁcally, that the hypotenuse
in Figure 4.23 is no longer vbE . Therefore, when we use the
Pythagorean theorem to ﬁnd vbE this time, we obtain

Summary

SUMMARY
If a particle moves with constant acceleration a and has velocity vi and position ri at
t ⫽ 0, its velocity and position vectors at some later time t are
vf ⫽ vi ⫹ at

(4.8)

rf ⫽ ri ⫹ vi t ⫹ 12 at 2

(4.9)

For two-dimensional motion in the xy plane under constant acceleration, each of
these vector expressions is equivalent to two component expressions — one for the
motion in the x direction and one for the motion in the y direction. You should be
able to break the two-dimensional motion of any object into these two components.
Projectile motion is one type of two-dimensional motion under constant acceleration, where a x ⫽ 0 and a y ⫽ ⫺g. It is useful to think of projectile motion as
the superposition of two motions: (1) constant-velocity motion in the x direction
and (2) free-fall motion in the vertical direction subject to a constant downward
acceleration of magnitude g ⫽ 9.80 m/s2. You should be able to analyze the motion in terms of separate horizontal and vertical components of velocity, as shown
in Figure 4.24.
A particle moving in a circle of radius r with constant speed v is in uniform
circular motion. It undergoes a centripetal (or radial) acceleration ar because the
direction of v changes in time. The magnitude of ar is
ar ⫽

v2
r

(4.18)

and its direction is always toward the center of the circle.
If a particle moves along a curved path in such a way that both the magnitude
and the direction of v change in time, then the particle has an acceleration vector
that can be described by two component vectors: (1) a radial component vector ar
that causes the change in direction of v and (2) a tangential component vector
at that causes the change in magnitude of v. The magnitude of ar is v 2/r, and the
magnitude of at is d兩 v 兩/dt. You should be able to sketch motion diagrams for an
object following a curved path and show how the velocity and acceleration vectors
change as the object’s motion varies.
The velocity v of a particle measured in a ﬁxed frame of reference S can be related to the velocity vⴕ of the same particle measured in a moving frame of reference S⬘ by
vⴕ ⫽ v ⫺ v0
(4.21)
where v0 is the velocity of S⬘ relative to S. You should be able to translate back and
forth between different frames of reference.

Motion in Two Dimensions

QUESTIONS
1. Can an object accelerate if its speed is constant? Can an
object accelerate if its velocity is constant?
2. If the average velocity of a particle is zero in some time interval, what can you say about the displacement of the
particle for that interval?
3. If you know the position vectors of a particle at two points
along its path and also know the time it took to get from
one point to the other, can you determine the particle’s
instantaneous velocity? Its average velocity? Explain.
4. Describe a situation in which the velocity of a particle is
always perpendicular to the position vector.
5. Explain whether or not the following particles have an acceleration: (a) a particle moving in a straight line with
constant speed and (b) a particle moving around a curve
with constant speed.
6. Correct the following statement: “The racing car rounds
the turn at a constant velocity of 90 mi/h.’’
7. Determine which of the following moving objects have an
approximately parabolic trajectory: (a) a ball thrown in
an arbitrary direction, (b) a jet airplane, (c) a rocket leaving the launching pad, (d) a rocket whose engines fail a
few minutes after launch, (e) a tossed stone moving to
the bottom of a pond.
8. A rock is dropped at the same instant that a ball at the
same initial elevation is thrown horizontally. Which will
have the greater speed when it reaches ground level?
9. A spacecraft drifts through space at a constant velocity.
Suddenly, a gas leak in the side of the spacecraft causes a
constant acceleration of the spacecraft in a direction perpendicular to the initial velocity. The orientation of the
spacecraft does not change, and so the acceleration remains perpendicular to the original direction of the velocity. What is the shape of the path followed by the
spacecraft in this situation?
10. A ball is projected horizontally from the top of a building.
One second later another ball is projected horizontally
from the same point with the same velocity. At what point
in the motion will the balls be closest to each other? Will
the ﬁrst ball always be traveling faster than the second
ball? How much time passes between the moment the
ﬁrst ball hits the ground and the moment the second one
hits the ground? Can the horizontal projection velocity of
the second ball be changed so that the balls arrive at the
ground at the same time?
11. A student argues that as a satellite orbits the Earth in a
circular path, the satellite moves with a constant velocity

and therefore has no acceleration. The professor claims
that the student is wrong because the satellite must have a
centripetal acceleration as it moves in its circular orbit.
What is wrong with the student’s argument?
What is the fundamental difference between the unit vectors r̂ and ␪ˆ and the unit vectors i and j?
At the end of its arc, the velocity of a pendulum is zero. Is
its acceleration also zero at this point?
If a rock is dropped from the top of a sailboat’s mast, will
it hit the deck at the same point regardless of whether the
boat is at rest or in motion at constant velocity?
A stone is thrown upward from the top of a building.
Does the stone’s displacement depend on the location of
the origin of the coordinate system? Does the stone’s velocity depend on the location of the origin?
Is it possible for a vehicle to travel around a curve without
accelerating? Explain.
A baseball is thrown with an initial velocity of (10i ⫹ 15j)
m/s. When it reaches the top of its trajectory, what are
(a) its velocity and (b) its acceleration? Neglect the effect
of air resistance.
An object moves in a circular path with constant speed v.
(a) Is the velocity of the object constant? (b) Is its acceleration constant? Explain.
A projectile is ﬁred at some angle to the horizontal with
some initial speed vi , and air resistance is neglected. Is
the projectile a freely falling body? What is its acceleration in the vertical direction? What is its acceleration in
the horizontal direction?
A projectile is ﬁred at an angle of 30° from the horizontal
with some initial speed. Firing at what other projectile angle results in the same range if the initial speed is the
same in both cases? Neglect air resistance.
A projectile is ﬁred on the Earth with some initial velocity.
Another projectile is ﬁred on the Moon with the same initial velocity. If air resistance is neglected, which projectile
has the greater range? Which reaches the greater altitude? (Note that the free-fall acceleration on the Moon is
about 1.6 m/s2.)
As a projectile moves through its parabolic trajectory,
which of these quantities, if any, remain constant:
(a) speed, (b) acceleration, (c) horizontal component of
velocity, (d) vertical component of velocity?
A passenger on a train that is moving with constant velocity drops a spoon. What is the acceleration of the spoon
relative to (a) the train and (b) the Earth?

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
4.1 (a) Because acceleration occurs whenever the velocity
changes in any way — with an increase or decrease in
speed, a change in direction, or both — the brake pedal
can also be considered an accelerator because it causes
the car to slow down. The steering wheel is also an accelerator because it changes the direction of the velocity
vector. (b) When the car is moving with constant speed,
the gas pedal is not causing an acceleration; it is an accelerator only when it causes a change in the speedometer reading.
4.2 (a) At only one point — the peak of the trajectory — are
the velocity and acceleration vectors perpendicular to
each other. (b) If the object is thrown straight up or
down, v and a are parallel to each other throughout the
downward motion. Otherwise, the velocity and acceleration vectors are never parallel to each other. (c) The
greater the maximum height, the longer it takes the projectile to reach that altitude and then fall back down from

it. So, as the angle increases from 0° to 90°, the time of
flight increases. Therefore, the 15° angle gives the shortest time of ﬂight, and the 75° angle gives the longest.
4.3 (a) Because the object is moving with a constant speed,
the velocity vector is always the same length; because the
motion is circular, this vector is always tangent to the circle. The only acceleration is that which changes the direction of the velocity vector; it points radially inward.

(b) Now there is a component of the acceleration vector
that is tangent to the circle and points in the direction
opposite the velocity. As a result, the acceleration vector
does not point toward the center. The object is slowing
down, and so the velocity vectors become shorter and
shorter.

The Concept of Force

I

n Chapters 2 and 4, we described motion in terms of displacement, velocity,
and acceleration without considering what might cause that motion. What
might cause one particle to remain at rest and another particle to accelerate? In
this chapter, we investigate what causes changes in motion. The two main factors
we need to consider are the forces acting on an object and the mass of the object.
We discuss the three basic laws of motion, which deal with forces and masses and
were formulated more than three centuries ago by Isaac Newton. Once we understand these laws, we can answer such questions as “What mechanism changes motion?” and “Why do some objects accelerate more than others?”

5.1

THE CONCEPT OF FORCE

Everyone has a basic understanding of the concept of force from everyday experience. When you push your empty dinner plate away, you exert a force on it. Similarly, you exert a force on a ball when you throw or kick it. In these examples, the
word force is associated with muscular activity and some change in the velocity of an
object. Forces do not always cause motion, however. For example, as you sit reading this book, the force of gravity acts on your body and yet you remain stationary.
As a second example, you can push (in other words, exert a force) on a large boulder and not be able to move it.
What force (if any) causes the Moon to orbit the Earth? Newton answered this
and related questions by stating that forces are what cause any change in the velocity of an object. Therefore, if an object moves with uniform motion (constant velocity), no force is required for the motion to be maintained. The Moon’s velocity
is not constant because it moves in a nearly circular orbit around the Earth. We
now know that this change in velocity is caused by the force exerted on the Moon
by the Earth. Because only a force can cause a change in velocity, we can think of
force as that which causes a body to accelerate. In this chapter, we are concerned with
the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the acceleration of
that object.
What happens when several forces act simultaneously on an object? In this
case, the object accelerates only if the net force acting on it is not equal to zero.
The net force acting on an object is deﬁned as the vector sum of all forces acting
on the object. (We sometimes refer to the net force as the total force, the resultant
force, or the unbalanced force.) If the net force exerted on an object is zero, then
the acceleration of the object is zero and its velocity remains constant. That
is, if the net force acting on the object is zero, then the object either remains at
rest or continues to move with constant velocity. When the velocity of an object is
constant (including the case in which the object remains at rest), the object is said
to be in equilibrium.
When a coiled spring is pulled, as in Figure 5.1a, the spring stretches. When a
stationary cart is pulled sufﬁcently hard that friction is overcome, as in Figure 5.1b,
the cart moves. When a football is kicked, as in Figure 5.1c, it is both deformed
and set in motion. These situations are all examples of a class of forces called contact forces. That is, they involve physical contact between two objects. Other examples of contact forces are the force exerted by gas molecules on the walls of a container and the force exerted by your feet on the ﬂoor.
Another class of forces, known as ﬁeld forces, do not involve physical contact between two objects but instead act through empty space. The force of gravitational
attraction between two objects, illustrated in Figure 5.1d, is an example of this
class of force. This gravitational force keeps objects bound to the Earth. The plan-

within the boxed area. Some agent in the environment external to the boxed area exerts a force
on the object.

ets of our Solar System are bound to the Sun by the action of gravitational forces.
Another common example of a ﬁeld force is the electric force that one electric
charge exerts on another, as shown in Figure 5.1e. These charges might be those
of the electron and proton that form a hydrogen atom. A third example of a ﬁeld
force is the force a bar magnet exerts on a piece of iron, as shown in Figure 5.1f.
The forces holding an atomic nucleus together also are ﬁeld forces but are very
short in range. They are the dominating interaction for particle separations of the
order of 10⫺15 m.
Early scientists, including Newton, were uneasy with the idea that a force can
act between two disconnected objects. To overcome this conceptual problem,
Michael Faraday (1791 – 1867) introduced the concept of a ﬁeld. According to this
approach, when object 1 is placed at some point P near object 2, we say that object
1 interacts with object 2 by virtue of the gravitational ﬁeld that exists at P. The
gravitational ﬁeld at P is created by object 2. Likewise, a gravitational ﬁeld created
by object 1 exists at the position of object 2. In fact, all objects create a gravitational ﬁeld in the space around themselves.
The distinction between contact forces and ﬁeld forces is not as sharp as you
may have been led to believe by the previous discussion. When examined at the
atomic level, all the forces we classify as contact forces turn out to be caused by

The Concept of Force

electric (ﬁeld) forces of the type illustrated in Figure 5.1e. Nevertheless, in developing models for macroscopic phenomena, it is convenient to use both classiﬁcations of forces. The only known fundamental forces in nature are all ﬁeld forces:
(1) gravitational forces between objects, (2) electromagnetic forces between electric charges, (3) strong nuclear forces between subatomic particles, and (4) weak
nuclear forces that arise in certain radioactive decay processes. In classical physics,
we are concerned only with gravitational and electromagnetic forces.

It is convenient to use the deformation of a spring to measure force. Suppose we
apply a vertical force to a spring scale that has a ﬁxed upper end, as shown in Figure 5.2a. The spring elongates when the force is applied, and a pointer on the
scale reads the value of the applied force. We can calibrate the spring by deﬁning
the unit force F1 as the force that produces a pointer reading of 1.00 cm. (Because
force is a vector quantity, we use the bold-faced symbol F.) If we now apply a different downward force F2 whose magnitude is 2 units, as seen in Figure 5.2b, the
pointer moves to 2.00 cm. Figure 5.2c shows that the combined effect of the two
collinear forces is the sum of the effects of the individual forces.
Now suppose the two forces are applied simultaneously with F1 downward and
F2 horizontal, as illustrated in Figure 5.2d. In this case, the pointer reads
√5 cm2 ⫽ 2.24 cm. The single force F that would produce this same reading is the
sum of the two vectors F1 and F2 , as described in Figure 5.2d. That is,
兩 F 兩 ⫽ √F 12 ⫹ F 22 ⫽ 2.24 units, and its direction is ␪ ⫽ tan⫺1(⫺ 0.500) ⫽ ⫺ 26.6°.
Because forces are vector quantities, you must use the rules of vector addition to obtain the net force acting on an object.

The Laws of Motion

NEWTON’S FIRST LAW AND INERTIAL FRAMES

Before we state Newton’s ﬁrst law, consider the following simple experiment. Suppose a book is lying on a table. Obviously, the book remains at rest. Now imagine
that you push the book with a horizontal force great enough to overcome the
force of friction between book and table. (This force you exert, the force of friction, and any other forces exerted on the book by other objects are referred to as
external forces.) You can keep the book in motion with constant velocity by applying
a force that is just equal in magnitude to the force of friction and acts in the opposite direction. If you then push harder so that the magnitude of your applied force
exceeds the magnitude of the force of friction, the book accelerates. If you stop
pushing, the book stops after moving a short distance because the force of friction
retards its motion. Suppose you now push the book across a smooth, highly waxed
ﬂoor. The book again comes to rest after you stop pushing but not as quickly as before. Now imagine a ﬂoor so highly polished that friction is absent; in this case, the
book, once set in motion, moves until it hits a wall.
Before about 1600, scientists felt that the natural state of matter was the state
of rest. Galileo was the ﬁrst to take a different approach to motion and the natural
state of matter. He devised thought experiments, such as the one we just discussed
for a book on a frictionless surface, and concluded that it is not the nature of an
object to stop once set in motion: rather, it is its nature to resist changes in its motion.
In his words, “Any velocity once imparted to a moving body will be rigidly maintained as long as the external causes of retardation are removed.”
This new approach to motion was later formalized by Newton in a form that
has come to be known as Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion:
In the absence of external forces, an object at rest remains at rest and an object
in motion continues in motion with a constant velocity (that is, with a constant
speed in a straight line).
In simpler terms, we can say that when no force acts on an object, the acceleration of the object is zero. If nothing acts to change the object’s motion, then its
velocity does not change. From the ﬁrst law, we conclude that any isolated object
(one that does not interact with its environment) is either at rest or moving with
constant velocity. The tendency of an object to resist any attempt to change its velocity is called the inertia of the object. Figure 5.3 shows one dramatic example of
a consequence of Newton’s ﬁrst law.
Another example of uniform (constant-velocity) motion on a nearly frictionless
surface is the motion of a light disk on a ﬁlm of air (the lubricant), as shown in Figure 5.4. If the disk is given an initial velocity, it coasts a great distance before stopping.
Finally, consider a spaceship traveling in space and far removed from any planets or other matter. The spaceship requires some propulsion system to change its
velocity. However, if the propulsion system is turned off when the spaceship
reaches a velocity v, the ship coasts at that constant velocity and the astronauts get
a free ride (that is, no propulsion system is required to keep them moving at the
velocity v).

Inertial Frames

Deﬁnition of inertial frame

As we saw in Section 4.6, a moving object can be observed from any number of reference frames. Newton’s ﬁrst law, sometimes called the law of inertia, deﬁnes a special set of reference frames called inertial frames. An inertial frame of reference

an object in motion continues
in motion with constant velocity. In this case, the wall of the
building did not exert a force
on the moving train that was
large enough to stop it.

Isaac Newton

is one that is not accelerating. Because Newton’s ﬁrst law deals only with objects
that are not accelerating, it holds only in inertial frames. Any reference frame that
moves with constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is itself an inertial frame.
(The Galilean transformations given by Equations 4.20 and 4.21 relate positions
and velocities between two inertial frames.)
A reference frame that moves with constant velocity relative to the distant stars
is the best approximation of an inertial frame, and for our purposes we can consider planet Earth as being such a frame. The Earth is not really an inertial frame
because of its orbital motion around the Sun and its rotational motion about its
own axis. As the Earth travels in its nearly circular orbit around the Sun, it experiences an acceleration of about 4.4 ⫻ 10⫺3 m/s2 directed toward the Sun. In addition, because the Earth rotates about its own axis once every 24 h, a point on the
equator experiences an additional acceleration of 3.37 ⫻ 10⫺2 m/s2 directed toward the center of the Earth. However, these accelerations are small compared
with g and can often be neglected. For this reason, we assume that the Earth is an
inertial frame, as is any other frame attached to it.
If an object is moving with constant velocity, an observer in one inertial frame
(say, one at rest relative to the object) claims that the acceleration of the object
and the resultant force acting on it are zero. An observer in any other inertial frame
also ﬁnds that a ⫽ 0 and ⌺F ⫽ 0 for the object. According to the ﬁrst law, a body
at rest and one moving with constant velocity are equivalent. A passenger in a car
moving along a straight road at a constant speed of 100 km/h can easily pour coffee into a cup. But if the driver steps on the gas or brake pedal or turns the steering wheel while the coffee is being poured, the car accelerates and it is no longer
an inertial frame. The laws of motion do not work as expected, and the coffee
ends up in the passenger’s lap!

Isaac Newton was one of the most
brilliant scientists in history. Before
the age of 30, he formulated the basic
concepts and laws of mechanics, discovered the law of universal gravitation, and invented the mathematical
methods of calculus. As a consequence of his theories, Newton was
able to explain the motions of the
planets, the ebb and ﬂow of the tides,
and many special features of the motions of the Moon and the Earth. He
also interpreted many fundamental
observations concerning the nature
of light. His contributions to physical
theories dominated scientiﬁc thought
for two centuries and remain important today. (Giraudon/Art Resource)

Deﬁnition of mass

MASS

Imagine playing catch with either a basketball or a bowling ball. Which ball is
more likely to keep moving when you try to catch it? Which ball has the greater
tendency to remain motionless when you try to throw it? Because the bowling ball
is more resistant to changes in its velocity, we say it has greater inertia than the basketball. As noted in the preceding section, inertia is a measure of how an object responds to an external force.
Mass is that property of an object that speciﬁes how much inertia the object
has, and as we learned in Section 1.1, the SI unit of mass is the kilogram. The
greater the mass of an object, the less that object accelerates under the action of
an applied force. For example, if a given force acting on a 3-kg mass produces an
acceleration of 4 m/s2, then the same force applied to a 6-kg mass produces an acceleration of 2 m/s2.
To describe mass quantitatively, we begin by comparing the accelerations a
given force produces on different objects. Suppose a force acting on an object of
mass m1 produces an acceleration a1 , and the same force acting on an object of mass
m 2 produces an acceleration a2 . The ratio of the two masses is deﬁned as the inverse ratio of the magnitudes of the accelerations produced by the force:
m1
a
⬅ 2
m2
a1

(5.1)

If one object has a known mass, the mass of the other object can be obtained from
acceleration measurements.
Mass is an inherent property of an object and is independent of the object’s surroundings and of the method used to measure it. Also, mass is a
scalar quantity and thus obeys the rules of ordinary arithmetic. That is, several
masses can be combined in simple numerical fashion. For example, if you combine a 3-kg mass with a 5-kg mass, their total mass is 8 kg. We can verify this result
experimentally by comparing the acceleration that a known force gives to several
objects separately with the acceleration that the same force gives to the same objects combined as one unit.
Mass should not be confused with weight. Mass and weight are two different
quantities. As we see later in this chapter, the weight of an object is equal to the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on the object and varies with location. For
example, a person who weighs 180 lb on the Earth weighs only about 30 lb on the
Moon. On the other hand, the mass of a body is the same everywhere: an object having a mass of 2 kg on the Earth also has a mass of 2 kg on the Moon.

Mass and weight are different
quantities

NEWTON’S SECOND LAW

Newton’s ﬁrst law explains what happens to an object when no forces act on it. It
either remains at rest or moves in a straight line with constant speed. Newton’s second law answers the question of what happens to an object that has a nonzero resultant force acting on it.

5.4

117

Newton’s Second Law

Imagine pushing a block of ice across a frictionless horizontal surface. When
you exert some horizontal force F, the block moves with some acceleration a. If
you apply a force twice as great, the acceleration doubles. If you increase the applied force to 3F, the acceleration triples, and so on. From such observations, we
conclude that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it.
The acceleration of an object also depends on its mass, as stated in the preceding section. We can understand this by considering the following experiment. If
you apply a force F to a block of ice on a frictionless surface, then the block undergoes some acceleration a. If the mass of the block is doubled, then the same
applied force produces an acceleration a/2. If the mass is tripled, then the same
applied force produces an acceleration a/3, and so on. According to this observation, we conclude that the magnitude of the acceleration of an object is inversely proportional to its mass.
These observations are summarized in Newton’s second law:
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on
it and inversely proportional to its mass.

Newton’s second law

Thus, we can relate mass and force through the following mathematical statement
of Newton’s second law:1

Is there any relationship between the net force acting on an object and the direction in
which the object moves?

Unit of Force
The SI unit of force is the newton, which is deﬁned as the force that, when acting
on a 1-kg mass, produces an acceleration of 1 m/s2. From this deﬁnition and Newton’s second law, we see that the newton can be expressed in terms of the following fundamental units of mass, length, and time:
1 N ⬅ 1 kg⭈m/s2

(5.4)

In the British engineering system, the unit of force is the pound, which is
deﬁned as the force that, when acting on a 1-slug mass,2 produces an acceleration
of 1 ft/s2:
1 lb ⬅ 1 slug⭈ft/s2

(5.5)

A convenient approximation is that 1 N ⬇ 14 lb.
1

Equation 5.2 is valid only when the speed of the object is much less than the speed of light. We treat
the relativistic situation in Chapter 39.

The slug is the unit of mass in the British engineering system and is that system’s counterpart of the
SI unit the kilogram. Because most of the calculations in our study of classical mechanics are in SI units,
the slug is seldom used in this text.

a human can provide.

THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AND WEIGHT

We are well aware that all objects are attracted to the Earth. The attractive force
exerted by the Earth on an object is called the force of gravity Fg . This force is
directed toward the center of the Earth,3 and its magnitude is called the weight
of the object.
We saw in Section 2.6 that a freely falling object experiences an acceleration g
acting toward the center of the Earth. Applying Newton’s second law ⌺F ⫽ ma to a
freely falling object of mass m, with a ⫽ g and ⌺F ⫽ Fg , we obtain
Fg ⫽ mg

(5.6)

Thus, the weight of an object, being deﬁned as the magnitude of Fg , is mg. (You
should not confuse the italicized symbol g for gravitational acceleration with the
nonitalicized symbol g used as the abbreviation for “gram.”)
Because it depends on g, weight varies with geographic location. Hence,
weight, unlike mass, is not an inherent property of an object. Because g decreases
with increasing distance from the center of the Earth, bodies weigh less at higher
altitudes than at sea level. For example, a 1 000-kg palette of bricks used in the
construction of the Empire State Building in New York City weighed about 1 N less
by the time it was lifted from sidewalk level to the top of the building. As another
example, suppose an object has a mass of 70.0 kg. Its weight in a location where
g ⫽ 9.80 m/s2 is Fg ⫽ mg ⫽ 686 N (about 150 lb). At the top of a mountain, however, where g ⫽ 9.77 m/s2, its weight is only 684 N. Therefore, if you want to lose
weight without going on a diet, climb a mountain or weigh yourself at 30 000 ft
during an airplane ﬂight!
Because weight ⫽ Fg ⫽ mg, we can compare the masses of two objects by measuring their weights on a spring scale. At a given location, the ratio of the weights
of two objects equals the ratio of their masses.

The life-support unit strapped to the back
of astronaut Edwin Aldrin weighed 300 lb
on the Earth. During his training, a 50-lb
mock-up was used. Although this effectively
simulated the reduced weight the unit
would have on the Moon, it did not correctly mimic the unchanging mass. It was
just as difﬁcult to accelerate the unit (perhaps by jumping or twisting suddenly) on
the Moon as on the Earth.

How Much Do You Weigh in an Elevator?

You have most likely had the experience of standing in an elevator that accelerates upward as it moves toward a higher
ﬂoor. In this case, you feel heavier. In fact, if you are standing
on a bathroom scale at the time, the scale measures a force
magnitude that is greater than your weight. Thus, you have
tactile and measured evidence that leads you to believe you
are heavier in this situation. Are you heavier?

Solution No, your weight is unchanged. To provide the
acceleration upward, the ﬂoor or scale must exert on your
feet an upward force that is greater in magnitude than your
weight. It is this greater force that you feel, which you interpret as feeling heavier. The scale reads this upward force, not
your weight, and so its reading increases.

NEWTON’S THIRD LAW

If you press against a corner of this textbook with your ﬁngertip, the book pushes
back and makes a small dent in your skin. If you push harder, the book does the
same and the dent in your skin gets a little larger. This simple experiment illustrates a general principle of critical importance known as Newton’s third law:
If two objects interact, the force F12 exerted by object 1 on object 2 is equal in
magnitude to and opposite in direction to the force F21 exerted by object 2 on
object 1:
F12 ⫽ ⫺F21

(5.7)

This law, which is illustrated in Figure 5.6a, states that a force that affects the motion of an object must come from a second, external, object. The external object, in
turn, is subject to an equal-magnitude but oppositely directed force exerted on it.

5.6

121

Newton’s Third Law

This is equivalent to stating that a single isolated force cannot exist. The force
that object 1 exerts on object 2 is sometimes called the action force, while the force
object 2 exerts on object 1 is called the reaction force. In reality, either force can be
labeled the action or the reaction force. The action force is equal in magnitude
to the reaction force and opposite in direction. In all cases, the action and
reaction forces act on different objects. For example, the force acting on a
freely falling projectile is Fg ⫽ mg, which is the force of gravity exerted by the
Earth on the projectile. The reaction to this force is the force exerted by the projectile on the Earth, Fg⬘ ⫽ ⫺Fg . The reaction force Fg⬘ accelerates the Earth toward
the projectile just as the action force Fg accelerates the projectile toward the Earth.
However, because the Earth has such a great mass, its acceleration due to this reaction force is negligibly small.
Another example of Newton’s third law is shown in Figure 5.6b. The force exerted by the hammer on the nail (the action force Fhn ) is equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction to the force exerted by the nail on the hammer (the reaction
force Fnh). It is this latter force that causes the hammer to stop its rapid forward
motion when it strikes the nail.
You experience Newton’s third law directly whenever you slam your ﬁst against
a wall or kick a football. You should be able to identify the action and reaction
forces in these cases.

Quick Quiz 5.4
A person steps from a boat toward a dock. Unfortunately, he forgot to tie the boat to the
dock, and the boat scoots away as he steps from it. Analyze this situation in terms of Newton’s third law.

The force of gravity Fg was deﬁned as the attractive force the Earth exerts on
an object. If the object is a TV at rest on a table, as shown in Figure 5.7a, why does
the TV not accelerate in the direction of Fg ? The TV does not accelerate because
the table holds it up. What is happening is that the table exerts on the TV an upward force n called the normal force.4 The normal force is a contact force that
prevents the TV from falling through the table and can have any magnitude
needed to balance the downward force Fg , up to the point of breaking the table. If
someone stacks books on the TV, the normal force exerted by the table on the TV
increases. If someone lifts up on the TV, the normal force exerted by the table on
the TV decreases. (The normal force becomes zero if the TV is raised off the table.)
The two forces in an action – reaction pair always act on different objects.
For the hammer-and-nail situation shown in Figure 5.6b, one force of the pair acts
on the hammer and the other acts on the nail. For the unfortunate person stepping out of the boat in Quick Quiz 5.4, one force of the pair acts on the person,
and the other acts on the boat.
For the TV in Figure 5.7, the force of gravity Fg and the normal force n are not
an action – reaction pair because they act on the same body — the TV. The two reaction forces in this situation — Fg⬘ and n⬘ — are exerted on objects other than the
TV. Because the reaction to Fg is the force Fg⬘ exerted by the TV on the Earth and
the reaction to n is the force n⬘ exerted by the TV on the table, we conclude that

A large man and a small boy stand facing each other on frictionless ice. They put their hands together and push against
each other so that they move apart. (a) Who moves away with
the higher speed?

Solution This situation is similar to what we saw in Quick
Quiz 5.5. According to Newton’s third law, the force exerted
by the man on the boy and the force exerted by the boy on
the man are an action – reaction pair, and so they must be
equal in magnitude. (A bathroom scale placed between their
hands would read the same, regardless of which way it faced.)

Therefore, the boy, having the lesser mass, experiences the
greater acceleration. Both individuals accelerate for the same
amount of time, but the greater acceleration of the boy over
this time interval results in his moving away from the interaction with the higher speed.
(b) Who moves farther while their hands are in contact?

Solution Because the boy has the greater acceleration, he
moves farther during the interval in which the hands are in
contact.

Technically, we should write this equation in the component form Fgy ⫽ ny ⫽ mgy . This component
notation is cumbersome, however, and so in situations in which a vector is parallel to a coordinate axis,
we usually do not include the subscript for that axis because there is no other component.

SOME APPLICATIONS OF NEWTON’S LAWS

In this section we apply Newton’s laws to objects that are either in equilibrium
(a ⫽ 0) or accelerating along a straight line under the action of constant external
forces. We assume that the objects behave as particles so that we need not worry
about rotational motion. We also neglect the effects of friction in those problems
involving motion; this is equivalent to stating that the surfaces are frictionless. Finally, we usually neglect the mass of any ropes involved. In this approximation, the
magnitude of the force exerted at any point along a rope is the same at all points
along the rope. In problem statements, the synonymous terms light, lightweight, and
of negligible mass are used to indicate that a mass is to be ignored when you work
the problems.
When we apply Newton’s laws to an object, we are interested only in external forces that act on the object. For example, in Figure 5.7 the only external
forces acting on the TV are n and Fg . The reactions to these forces, n⬘ and F⬘g , act
on the table and on the Earth, respectively, and therefore do not appear in Newton’s second law applied to the TV.
When a rope attached to an object is pulling on the object, the rope exerts a
force T on the object, and the magnitude of that force is called the tension in the
rope. Because it is the magnitude of a vector quantity, tension is a scalar quantity.
Consider a crate being pulled to the right on a frictionless, horizontal surface,
as shown in Figure 5.8a. Suppose you are asked to ﬁnd the acceleration of the
crate and the force the ﬂoor exerts on it. First, note that the horizontal force being applied to the crate acts through the rope. Use the symbol T to denote the
force exerted by the rope on the crate. The magnitude of T is equal to the tension
in the rope. A dotted circle is drawn around the crate in Figure 5.8a to remind you
that you are interested only in the forces acting on the crate. These are illustrated
in Figure 5.8b. In addition to the force T, this force diagram for the crate includes
the force of gravity Fg and the normal force n exerted by the ﬂoor on the crate.
Such a force diagram, referred to as a free-body diagram, shows all external
forces acting on the object. The construction of a correct free-body diagram is an
important step in applying Newton’s laws. The reactions to the forces we have
listed — namely, the force exerted by the crate on the rope, the force exerted by
the crate on the Earth, and the force exerted by the crate on the ﬂoor — are not included in the free-body diagram because they act on other bodies and not on the
crate.
We can now apply Newton’s second law in component form to the crate. The
only force acting in the x direction is T. Applying ⌺Fx ⫽ max to the horizontal motion gives

That is, the normal force has the same magnitude as the force of gravity but is in

In the situation just described, the magnitude of the normal force n is equal to
the magnitude of Fg , but this is not always the case. For example, suppose a book
is lying on a table and you push down on the book with a force F, as shown in Figure 5.9. Because the book is at rest and therefore not accelerating, ⌺Fy ⫽ 0, which
gives n ⫺ F g ⫺ F ⫽ 0, or n ⫽ F g ⫹ F. Other examples in which n ⫽ F g are presented later.
Consider a lamp suspended from a light chain fastened to the ceiling, as in
Figure 5.10a. The free-body diagram for the lamp (Figure 5.10b) shows that the
forces acting on the lamp are the downward force of gravity Fg and the upward
force T exerted by the chain. If we apply the second law to the lamp, noting that
a ⫽ 0, we see that because there are no forces in the x direction, ⌺Fx ⫽ 0 provides
no helpful information. The condition ⌺Fy ⫽ may ⫽ 0 gives

Again, note that T and Fg are not an action – reaction pair because they act on the
same object — the lamp. The reaction force to T is T⬘, the downward force exerted
by the lamp on the chain, as shown in Figure 5.10c. The ceiling exerts on the

Problem-Solving Hints
Applying Newton’s Laws
The following procedure is recommended when dealing with problems involving Newton’s laws:
• Draw a simple, neat diagram of the system.
• Isolate the object whose motion is being analyzed. Draw a free-body diagram
for this object. For systems containing more than one object, draw separate
free-body diagrams for each object. Do not include in the free-body diagram
forces exerted by the object on its surroundings. Establish convenient coordinate axes for each object and ﬁnd the components of the forces along
these axes.
• Apply Newton’s second law, ⌺F ⫽ ma, in component form. Check your dimensions to make sure that all terms have units of force.
• Solve the component equations for the unknowns. Remember that you must
have as many independent equations as you have unknowns to obtain a
complete solution.
• Make sure your results are consistent with the free-body diagram. Also check
the predictions of your solutions for extreme values of the variables. By doing so, you can often detect errors in your results.

Some Applications of Newton’s Laws

A Trafﬁc Light at Rest

A trafﬁc light weighing 125 N hangs from a cable tied to two
other cables fastened to a support. The upper cables make
angles of 37.0° and 53.0° with the horizontal. Find the tension in the three cables.

Solution Figure 5.11a shows the type of drawing we might
make of this situation. We then construct two free-body diagrams — one for the trafﬁc light, shown in Figure 5.11b, and
one for the knot that holds the three cables together, as seen
in Figure 5.11c. This knot is a convenient object to choose because all the forces we are interested in act through it. Because the acceleration of the system is zero, we know that the
net force on the light and the net force on the knot are both
zero.
In Figure 5.11b the force T3 exerted by the vertical cable
supports the light, and so T3 ⫽ F g ⫽ 125 N.

From (1) we see that the horizontal components of T1 and T2
must be equal in magnitude, and from (2) we see that the
sum of the vertical components of T1 and T2 must balance
the weight of the light. We solve (1) for T2 in terms of T1 to
obtain

This value for T2 is substituted into (2) to yield

Next, we

T1 ⫽ 75.1 N

choose the coordinate axes shown in Figure 5.11c and resolve
the forces acting on the knot into their components:

This problem is important because it combines what we have
learned about vectors with the new topic of forces. The general approach taken here is very powerful, and we will repeat
it many times.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 5.5

The Laws of Motion

Forces Between Cars in a Train

In a train, the cars are connected by couplers, which are under
tension as the locomotive pulls the train. As you move down
the train from locomotive to caboose, does the tension in the
couplers increase, decrease, or stay the same as the train
speeds up? When the engineer applies the brakes, the couplers are under compression. How does this compression
force vary from locomotive to caboose? (Assume that only the
brakes on the wheels of the engine are applied.)

Solution As the train speeds up, the tension decreases
from the front of the train to the back. The coupler between

EXAMPLE 5.6

the locomotive and the ﬁrst car must apply enough force to
accelerate all of the remaining cars. As you move back along
the train, each coupler is accelerating less mass behind it.
The last coupler has to accelerate only the caboose, and so it
is under the least tension.
When the brakes are applied, the force again decreases
from front to back. The coupler connecting the locomotive
to the ﬁrst car must apply a large force to slow down all the
remaining cars. The ﬁnal coupler must apply a force large
enough to slow down only the caboose.

Crate on a Frictionless Incline

A crate of mass m is placed on a frictionless inclined plane of
angle ␪. (a) Determine the acceleration of the crate after it is
released.

Solution Because we know the forces acting on the crate,
we can use Newton’s second law to determine its acceleration. (In other words, we have classiﬁed the problem; this
gives us a hint as to the approach to take.) We make a sketch
as in Figure 5.12a and then construct the free-body diagram
for the crate, as shown in Figure 5.12b. The only forces acting
on the crate are the normal force n exerted by the inclined
plane, which acts perpendicular to the plane, and the force
of gravity Fg ⫽ mg, which acts vertically downward. For problems involving inclined planes, it is convenient to choose the
coordinate axes with x downward along the incline and y perpendicular to it, as shown in Figure 5.12b. (It is possible to
solve the problem with “standard” horizontal and vertical
axes. You may want to try this, just for practice.) Then, we rey

place the force of gravity by a component of magnitude
mg sin ␪ along the positive x axis and by one of magnitude
mg cos ␪ along the negative y axis.
Now we apply Newton’s second law in component form,
noting that ay ⫽ 0:
(1)
(2)

⌺ F x ⫽ mg sin ␪ ⫽ ma x
⌺ F y ⫽ n ⫺ mg cos ␪ ⫽ 0

Solving (1) for ax , we see that the acceleration along the incline
is caused by the component of Fg directed down the incline:
(3)

a x ⫽ g sin ␪

Note that this acceleration component is independent of the
mass of the crate! It depends only on the angle of inclination
and on g.
From (2) we conclude that the component of Fg perpendicular to the incline is balanced by the normal force; that is, n ⫽
mg cos ␪. This is one example of a situation in which the normal force is not equal in magnitude to the weight of the object.

Special Cases Looking over our results, we see that in the
extreme case of ␪ ⫽ 90°, ax ⫽ g and n ⫽ 0. This condition
corresponds to the crate’s being in free fall. When ␪ ⫽ 0,
ax ⫽ 0 and n ⫽ mg (its maximum value); in this case, the
crate is sitting on a horizontal surface.
(b) Suppose the crate is released from rest at the top of
the incline, and the distance from the front edge of the crate
to the bottom is d. How long does it take the front edge to
reach the bottom, and what is its speed just as it gets there?
Because ax ⫽ constant, we can apply Equation
2.11, x f ⫺ x i ⫽ v xi t ⫹ 12a x t 2, to analyze the crate’s motion.

We see from equations (4) and (5) that the time t needed to
reach the bottom and the speed vxf , like acceleration, are independent of the crate’s mass. This suggests a simple method
you can use to measure g, using an inclined air track: Measure the angle of inclination, some distance traveled by a cart
along the incline, and the time needed to travel that distance. The value of g can then be calculated from (4).

One Block Pushes Another

Two blocks of masses m1 and m 2 are placed in contact with
each other on a frictionless horizontal surface. A constant
horizontal force F is applied to the block of mass m1 . (a) Determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the two-block
system.

Solution Common sense tells us that both blocks must experience the same acceleration because they remain in contact with each other. Just as in the preceding example, we
make a labeled sketch and free-body diagrams, which are
shown in Figure 5.13. In Figure 5.13a the dashed line indicates that we treat the two blocks together as a system. Because F is the only external horizontal force acting on the system (the two blocks), we have

Some Applications of Newton’s Laws

Treating the two blocks together as a system simpliﬁes the
solution but does not provide information about internal
forces.
(b) Determine the magnitude of the contact force between the two blocks.

Solution To solve this part of the problem, we must treat
each block separately with its own free-body diagram, as in
Figures 5.13b and 5.13c. We denote the contact force by P.
From Figure 5.13c, we see that the only horizontal force acting on block 2 is the contact force P (the force exerted by
block 1 on block 2), which is directed to the right. Applying
Newton’s second law to block 2 gives
(2)

F

From this result, we see that the contact force P exerted by
block 1 on block 2 is less than the applied force F. This is consistent with the fact that the force required to accelerate
block 2 alone must be less than the force required to produce the same acceleration for the two-block system.
It is instructive to check this expression for P by considering the forces acting on block 1, shown in Figure 5.13b. The
horizontal forces acting on this block are the applied force F
to the right and the contact force P⬘ to the left (the force exerted by block 2 on block 1). From Newton’s third law, P⬘ is
the reaction to P, so that 兩 P⬘ 兩 ⫽ 兩 P 兩. Applying Newton’s second law to block 1 produces

Weighing a Fish in an Elevator

A person weighs a ﬁsh of mass m on a spring scale attached to
the ceiling of an elevator, as illustrated in Figure 5.14. Show
that if the elevator accelerates either upward or downward,
the spring scale gives a reading that is different from the
weight of the ﬁsh.

If the elevator moves upward with an acceleration a relative to an observer standing outside the elevator in an inertial
frame (see Fig. 5.14a), Newton’s second law applied to the
ﬁsh gives the net force on the ﬁsh:

Solution

where we have chosen upward as the positive direction. Thus,
we conclude from (1) that the scale reading T is greater than
the weight mg if a is upward, so that ay is positive, and that
the reading is less than mg if a is downward, so that ay is
negative.
For example, if the weight of the ﬁsh is 40.0 N and a is upward, so that ay ⫽ ⫹2.00 m/s2, the scale reading from (1) is

The external forces acting on the ﬁsh are the
downward force of gravity Fg ⫽ mg and the force T exerted
by the scale. By Newton’s third law, the tension T is also the

of ﬁsh and person is still that of a freely falling object relative

vice is sometimes used in the laboratory to measure the freefall acceleration. Determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the two objects and the tension in the lightweight
cord.

Solution If we were to deﬁne our system as being made
up of both objects, as we did in Example 5.7, we would have
to determine an internal force (tension in the cord). We must
deﬁne two systems here — one for each object — and apply
Newton’s second law to each. The free-body diagrams for the
two objects are shown in Figure 5.15b. Two forces act on each
object: the upward force T exerted by the cord and the downward force of gravity.
We need to be very careful with signs in problems such as
this, in which a string or rope passes over a pulley or some
other structure that causes the string or rope to bend. In Figure 5.15a, notice that if object 1 accelerates upward, then object 2 accelerates downward. Thus, for consistency with signs,
if we deﬁne the upward direction as positive for object 1, we
must deﬁne the downward direction as positive for object 2.
With this sign convention, both objects accelerate in the
same direction as deﬁned by the choice of sign. With this sign
convention applied to the forces, the y component of the net
force exerted on object 1 is T ⫺ m1g, and the y component of
the net force exerted on object 2 is m 2g ⫺ T. Because the objects are connected by a cord, their accelerations must be
equal in magnitude. (Otherwise the cord would stretch or
break as the distance between the objects increased.) If we assume m 2 ⬎ m1 , then object 1 must accelerate upward and object 2 downward.
When Newton’s second law is applied to object 1, we
obtain

In (3) we have replaced ax⬘ with a because that is the acceleration’s only component. In other words, the two objects have accelerations of the same magnitude a, which is what we are trying
to ﬁnd. Equations (1) and (4) provide no information regarding the acceleration. However, if we solve (2) for T and then
substitute this value for T into (3) and solve for a, we obtain

Answer

FORCES OF FRICTION

When a body is in motion either on a surface or in a viscous medium such as air or
water, there is resistance to the motion because the body interacts with its surroundings. We call such resistance a force of friction. Forces of friction are very
important in our everyday lives. They allow us to walk or run and are necessary for
the motion of wheeled vehicles.
Have you ever tried to move a heavy desk across a rough ﬂoor? You push
harder and harder until all of a sudden the desk seems to “break free” and subsequently moves relatively easily. It takes a greater force to start the desk moving
than it does to keep it going once it has started sliding. To understand why this
happens, consider a book on a table, as shown in Figure 5.17a. If we apply an external horizontal force F to the book, acting to the right, the book remains stationary if F is not too great. The force that counteracts F and keeps the book from
moving acts to the left and is called the frictional force f.
As long as the book is not moving, f ⫽ F. Because the book is stationary, we
call this frictional force the force of static friction fs . Experiments show that this
force arises from contacting points that protrude beyond the general level of the
surfaces in contact, even for surfaces that are apparently very smooth, as shown in
the magniﬁed view in Figure 5.17a. (If the surfaces are clean and smooth at the
atomic level, they are likely to weld together when contact is made.) The frictional
force arises in part from one peak’s physically blocking the motion of a peak from
the opposing surface, and in part from chemical bonding of opposing points as
they come into contact. If the surfaces are rough, bouncing is likely to occur, further complicating the analysis. Although the details of friction are quite complex
at the atomic level, this force ultimately involves an electrical interaction between
atoms or molecules.
If we increase the magnitude of F, as shown in Figure 5.17b, the magnitude of
fs increases along with it, keeping the book in place. The force fs cannot increase
indeﬁnitely, however. Eventually the surfaces in contact can no longer supply sufﬁcient frictional force to counteract F, and the book accelerates. When it is on the
verge of moving, fs is a maximum, as shown in Figure 5.17c. When F exceeds fs,max ,
the book accelerates to the right. Once the book is in motion, the retarding frictional force becomes less than fs,max (see Fig. 5.17c). When the book is in motion,
we call the retarding force the force of kinetic friction fk . If F ⫽ fk , then the
book moves to the right with constant speed. If F ⬎ fk , then there is an unbalanced
force F ⫺ fk in the positive x direction, and this force accelerates the book to the
right. If the applied force F is removed, then the frictional force fk acting to the
left accelerates the book in the negative x direction and eventually brings it to rest.
Experimentally, we ﬁnd that, to a good approximation, both fs,max and fk are
proportional to the normal force acting on the book. The following empirical laws
of friction summarize the experimental observations:

where the dimensionless constant ␮s is called the coefﬁcient of static friction
and n is the magnitude of the normal force. The equality in Equation 5.8 holds

All values are approximate. In some cases, the coefﬁcient of friction can exceed 1.0.

• The coefﬁcients of friction are nearly independent of the area of contact be-

tween the surfaces. To understand why, we must examine the difference between the apparent contact area, which is the area we see with our eyes, and the
real contact area, represented by two irregular surfaces touching, as shown in the
magniﬁed view in Figure 5.17a. It seems that increasing the apparent contact
area does not increase the real contact area. When we increase the apparent
area (without changing anything else), there is less force per unit area driving
the jagged points together. This decrease in force counteracts the effect of having more points involved.
Although the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction can vary with speed, we shall usually neglect any such variations in this text. We can easily demonstrate the approximate nature of the equations by trying to get a block to slip down an incline at
constant speed. Especially at low speeds, the motion is likely to be characterized by
alternate episodes of sticking and movement.

Why Does the Sled Accelerate?

A horse pulls a sled along a level, snow-covered road, causing
the sled to accelerate, as shown in Figure 5.18a. Newton’s
third law states that the sled exerts an equal and opposite
force on the horse. In view of this, how can the sled accelerate? Under what condition does the system (horse plus sled)
move with constant velocity?

Solution It is important to remember that the forces described in Newton’s third law act on different objects — the
horse exerts a force on the sled, and the sled exerts an equalmagnitude and oppositely directed force on the horse. Because we are interested only in the motion of the sled, we do
not consider the forces it exerts on the horse. When deter-

mining the motion of an object, you must add only the forces
on that object. The horizontal forces exerted on the sled are
the forward force T exerted by the horse and the backward
force of friction fsled between sled and snow (see Fig. 5.18b).
When the forward force exceeds the backward force, the sled
accelerates to the right.
The force that accelerates the system (horse plus sled) is
the frictional force fhorse exerted by the Earth on the horse’s
feet. The horizontal forces exerted on the horse are the forward force fhorse exerted by the Earth and the backward tension force T exerted by the sled (Fig. 5.18c). The resultant of

these two forces causes the horse to accelerate. When fhorse
balances fsled , the system moves with constant velocity.

Exercise

Are the normal force exerted by the snow on the
horse and the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the
horse a third-law pair?

Answer No, because they act on the same object. Third-law
force pairs are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction,
and the forces act on different objects.

Experimental Determination of ␮s and ␮k

EXAMPLE 5.12

The following is a simple method of measuring coefﬁcients of
friction: Suppose a block is placed on a rough surface inclined relative to the horizontal, as shown in Figure 5.19. The
incline angle is increased until the block starts to move. Let
us show that by measuring the critical angle ␪c at which this
slipping just occurs, we can obtain ␮s .

of slipping but has not yet moved. When we take x to be parallel to the plane and y perpendicular to it, Newton’s second
law applied to the block for this balanced situation gives

Solution

We can eliminate mg by substituting mg ⫽ n/cos ␪ from
(2) into (1) to get

The only forces acting on the block are the force
of gravity mg, the normal force n, and the force of static friction fs . These forces balance when the block is on the verge

perpendicular to the incline mg cos ␪.

A hockey puck on a frozen pond is given an initial speed of
20.0 m/s. If the puck always remains on the ice and slides
115 m before coming to rest, determine the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction between the puck and ice.

Solution The forces acting on the puck after it is in motion are shown in Figure 5.20. If we assume that the force of
kinetic friction fk remains constant, then this force produces
a uniform acceleration of the puck in the direction opposite
its velocity, causing the puck to slow down. First, we ﬁnd this
acceleration in terms of the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction, using Newton’s second law. Knowing the acceleration of the
puck and the distance it travels, we can then use the equations of kinematics to ﬁnd the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction.

Acceleration of Two Connected Objects When Friction Is Present

A block of mass m1 on a rough, horizontal surface is connected to a ball of mass m 2 by a lightweight cord over a lightweight, frictionless pulley, as shown in Figure 5.21a. A force

the block as shown. The coefﬁcient of kinetic friction between the block and surface is ␮k . Determine the magnitude
of the acceleration of the two objects.

Solution

␮k ⫽

We start by drawing free-body diagrams for the
two objects, as shown in Figures 5.21b and 5.21c. (Are you beginning to see the similarities in all these examples?) Next,
we apply Newton’s second law in component form to each
object and use Equation 5.9, f k ⫽ ␮kn. Then we can solve for
the acceleration in terms of the parameters given.
The applied force F has x and y components F cos ␪ and
F sin ␪, respectively. Applying Newton’s second law to both
objects and assuming the motion of the block is to the right,
we obtain

Motion of block:

⌺ F x ⫽ m 2a x ⫽ 0
⌺ F y ⫽ T ⫺ m 2g ⫽ m 2a y ⫽ m 2a

Note that because the two objects are connected, we can
equate the magnitudes of the x component of the acceleration of the block and the y component of the acceleration of
the ball. From Equation 5.9 we know that fk ⫽ ␮k n, and from
(2) we know that n ⫽ m1 g ⫺ F sin ␪ (note that in this case n is
not equal to m1 g); therefore,

Note that the acceleration of the block can be either to

APPLICATION

Automobile Antilock Braking Systems (ABS)

If an automobile tire is rolling and not slipping on a road surface, then the maximum frictional force that the road can exert on the tire is the force of static friction ␮s n. One must use
static friction in this situation because at the point of contact
between the tire and the road, no sliding of one surface over
the other occurs if the tire is not skidding. However, if the
tire starts to skid, the frictional force exerted on it is reduced
to the force of kinetic friction ␮k n. Thus, to maximize the
frictional force and minimize stopping distance, the wheels
must maintain pure rolling motion and not skid. An additional beneﬁt of maintaining wheel rotation is that directional control is not lost as it is in skidding.
Unfortunately, in emergency situations drivers typically
press down as hard as they can on the brake pedal, “locking
the brakes.” This stops the wheels from rotating, ensuring a
skid and reducing the frictional force from the static to the
kinetic case. To address this problem, automotive engineers

have developed antilock braking systems (ABS) that very
brieﬂy release the brakes when a wheel is just about to stop
turning. This maintains rolling contact between the tire and
the pavement. When the brakes are released momentarily,
the stopping distance is greater than it would be if the brakes
were being applied continuously. However, through the use
of computer control, the “brake-off ” time is kept to a minimum. As a result, the stopping distance is much less than
what it would be if the wheels were to skid.
Let us model the stopping of a car by examining real data.
In a recent issue of AutoWeek,7 the braking performance for a
Toyota Corolla was measured. These data correspond to the
braking force acquired by a highly trained, professional driver. We begin by assuming constant acceleration. (Why do we
need to make this assumption?) The magazine provided the
initial speed and stopping distance in non-SI units. After converting these values to SI we use v xf 2 ⫽ v xi2 ⫹ 2a x x to deter-

We take an average value of acceleration of ⫺ 8.4 m/s2,
which is approximately 0.86g. We then calculate the coefﬁcient of friction from ⌺F ⫽ ␮s mg ⫽ ma; this gives ␮s ⫽ 0.86 for
the Toyota. This is lower than the rubber-to-concrete value
given in Table 5.2. Can you think of any reasons for this?
Let us now estimate the stopping distance of the car if the
wheels were skidding. Examining Table 5.2 again, we see that
the difference between the coefﬁcients of static and kinetic
friction for rubber against concrete is about 0.2. Let us therefore assume that our coefﬁcients differ by the same amount,
so that ␮k ⬇ 0.66. This allows us to calculate estimated stopping distances for the case in which the wheels are locked
and the car skids across the pavement. The results illustrate
the advantage of not allowing the wheels to skid.

An ABS keeps the wheels rotating, with the result that the
higher coefﬁcient of static friction is maintained between the
tires and road. This approximates the technique of a professional driver who is able to maintain the wheels at the point
of maximum frictional force. Let us estimate the ABS performance by assuming that the magnitude of the acceleration is
not quite as good as that achieved by the professional driver
but instead is reduced by 5%.
We now plot in Figure 5.22 vehicle speed versus distance
from where the brakes were applied (at an initial speed of
80 mi/h ⫽ 37.5 m/s) for the three cases of amateur driver,
professional driver, and estimated ABS performance (amateur driver). We ﬁnd that a markedly shorter distance is necessary for stopping without locking the wheels and skidding
and a satisfactory value of stopping distance when the ABS
computer maintains tire rotation.
The purpose of the ABS is to help typical drivers (whose tendency is to lock the wheels in an emergency) to better maintain
control of their automobiles and minimize stopping distance.

SUMMARY
Newton’s ﬁrst law states that, in the absence of an external force, a body at rest
remains at rest and a body in uniform motion in a straight line maintains that motion. An inertial frame is one that is not accelerating.
Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The
net force acting on an object equals the product of its mass and its acceleration:

ﬁed forces. If the object is either stationary or moving with constant velocity, then
the forces must vectorially cancel each other.
The force of gravity exerted on an object is equal to the product of its mass
(a scalar quantity) and the free-fall acceleration: Fg ⫽ mg. The weight of an object is the magnitude of the force of gravity acting on the object.
Newton’s third law states that if two objects interact, then the force exerted by
object 1 on object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by object 2 on object 1. Thus, an isolated force cannot exist in nature. Make
sure you can identify third-law pairs and the two objects upon which they act.
The maximum force of static friction fs,max between an object and a surface
is proportional to the normal force acting on the object. In general, fs ⱕ ␮s n,
where ␮s is the coefﬁcient of static friction and n is the magnitude of the normal
force. When an object slides over a surface, the direction of the force of kinetic
friction fk is opposite the direction of sliding motion and is also proportional to
the magnitude of the normal force. The magnitude of this force is given by fk ⫽
␮k n, where ␮k is the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction.
More on Free-Body Diagrams

To be successful in applying Newton’s second law to a system, you must be able to
recognize all the forces acting on the system. That is, you must be able to construct
the correct free-body diagram. The importance of constructing the free-body diagram cannot be overemphasized. In Figure 5.23 a number of systems are presented together with their free-body diagrams. You should examine these carefully
and then construct free-body diagrams for other systems described in the end-ofchapter problems. When a system contains more than one element, it is important
that you construct a separate free-body diagram for each element.
As usual, F denotes some applied force, Fg ⫽ mg is the force of gravity, n denotes a normal force, f is the force of friction, and T is the force whose magnitude
is the tension exerted on an object.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
5.1 (a) True. Newton’s ﬁrst law tells us that motion requires
no force: An object in motion continues to move at constant velocity in the absence of external forces. (b) True.
A stationary object can have several forces acting on it,
but if the vector sum of all these external forces is zero,

there is no net force and the object remains stationary.
It also is possible to have a net force and no motion, but
only for an instant. A ball tossed vertically upward stops
at the peak of its path for an inﬁnitesimally short time,
but the force of gravity is still acting on it. Thus, al-

though v ⫽ 0 at the peak, the net force acting on the
ball is not zero.
5.2 No. Direction of motion is part of an object’s velocity,
and force determines the direction of acceleration, not
that of velocity.
5.3 (a) Force of gravity. (b) Force of gravity. The only external force acting on the ball at all points in its trajectory
is the downward force of gravity.
5.4 As the person steps out of the boat, he pushes against it
with his foot, expecting the boat to push back on him so
that he accelerates toward the dock. However, because
the boat is untied, the force exerted by the foot causes
the boat to scoot away from the dock. As a result, the
person is not able to exert a very large force on the boat
before it moves out of reach. Therefore, the boat does
not exert a very large reaction force on him, and he

ends up not being accelerated sufﬁciently to make it to
the dock. Consequently, he falls into the water instead.
If a small dog were to jump from the untied boat toward
the dock, the force exerted by the boat on the dog
would probably be enough to ensure the dog’s successful landing because of the dog’s small mass.
5.5 (a) The same force is experienced by both. The ﬂy and
bus experience forces that are equal in magnitude but
opposite in direction. (b) The ﬂy. Because the ﬂy has
such a small mass, it undergoes a very large acceleration.
The huge mass of the bus means that it more effectively
resists any change in its motion.
5.6 (b) The crate accelerates to the right. Because the only
horizontal force acting on it is the force of static friction
between its bottom surface and the truck bed, that force
must also be directed to the right.

CHAPTER 6

Circular Motion and Other Applications of Newton’s Laws

I

n the preceding chapter we introduced Newton’s laws of motion and applied
them to situations involving linear motion. Now we discuss motion that is
slightly more complicated. For example, we shall apply Newton’s laws to objects
traveling in circular paths. Also, we shall discuss motion observed from an accelerating frame of reference and motion in a viscous medium. For the most part, this
chapter is a series of examples selected to illustrate the application of Newton’s
laws to a wide variety of circumstances.

6.1

NEWTON’S SECOND LAW APPLIED TO
UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

In Section 4.4 we found that a particle moving with uniform speed v in a circular
path of radius r experiences an acceleration ar that has a magnitude
ar 

4.7

v2
r

The acceleration is called the centripetal acceleration because ar is directed toward
the center of the circle. Furthermore, ar is always perpendicular to v. (If there
were a component of acceleration parallel to v, the particle’s speed would be
changing.)
Consider a ball of mass m that is tied to a string of length r and is being
whirled at constant speed in a horizontal circular path, as illustrated in Figure 6.1.
Its weight is supported by a low-friction table. Why does the ball move in a circle?
Because of its inertia, the tendency of the ball is to move in a straight line; however, the string prevents motion along a straight line by exerting on the ball a
force that makes it follow the circular path. This force is directed along the string
toward the center of the circle, as shown in Figure 6.1. This force can be any one
of our familiar forces causing an object to follow a circular path.
If we apply Newton’s second law along the radial direction, we ﬁnd that the
value of the net force causing the centripetal acceleration can be evaluated:

Figure 6.2 When the string breaks, the
ball moves in the direction tangent to the
circle.
r

A force causing a centripetal acceleration acts toward the center of the circular
path and causes a change in the direction of the velocity vector. If that force
should vanish, the object would no longer move in its circular path; instead, it
would move along a straight-line path tangent to the circle. This idea is illustrated
in Figure 6.2 for the ball whirling at the end of a string. If the string breaks at
some instant, the ball moves along the straight-line path tangent to the circle at
the point where the string broke.

Quick Quiz 6.1
Is it possible for a car to move in a circular path in such a way that it has a tangential acceleration but no centripetal acceleration?

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 6.1

An athlete in the process of throwing the hammer at the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. The force exerted by the chain
is the force causing the circular
motion. Only when the athlete releases the hammer will it move
along a straight-line path tangent to
the circle.

Forces That Cause Centripetal Acceleration

The force causing centripetal acceleration is sometimes
called a centripetal force. We are familiar with a variety of forces
in nature — friction, gravity, normal forces, tension, and so
forth. Should we add centripetal force to this list?

Solution No; centripetal force should not be added to this
list. This is a pitfall for many students. Giving the force causing circular motion a name — centripetal force — leads many
students to consider it a new kind of force rather than a new
role for force. A common mistake in force diagrams is to draw
all the usual forces and then to add another vector for the
centripetal force. But it is not a separate force — it is simply
one of our familiar forces acting in the role of a force that causes
a circular motion.

Consider some examples. For the motion of the Earth
around the Sun, the centripetal force is gravity. For an object
sitting on a rotating turntable, the centripetal force is friction.
For a rock whirled on the end of a string, the centripetal
force is the force of tension in the string. For an amusementpark patron pressed against the inner wall of a rapidly rotating circular room, the centripetal force is the normal force exerted by the wall. What’s more, the centripetal force could
be a combination of two or more forces. For example, as a
Ferris-wheel rider passes through the lowest point, the centripetal force on her is the difference between the normal
force exerted by the seat and her weight.

force. At a certain instant of time, the force on the ball changes abruptly to a new force, and
the ball follows the paths indicated by the solid line with an arrowhead in each of the four
parts of the ﬁgure. For each part of the ﬁgure, describe the magnitude and direction of the
force required to make the ball move in the solid path. If the dotted line represents the
path of a ball being whirled on the end of a string, which path does the ball follow if
the string breaks?

Let us consider some examples of uniform circular motion. In each case, be
sure to recognize the external force (or forces) that causes the body to move in its
circular path.

EXAMPLE 6.2

How Fast Can It Spin?

A ball of mass 0.500 kg is attached to the end of a cord
1.50 m long. The ball is whirled in a horizontal circle as was
shown in Figure 6.1. If the cord can withstand a maximum
tension of 50.0 N, what is the maximum speed the ball can attain before the cord breaks? Assume that the string remains
horizontal during the motion.

Solution It is difﬁcult to know what might be a reasonable
value for the answer. Nonetheless, we know that it cannot be
too large, say 100 m/s, because a person cannot make a ball
move so quickly. It makes sense that the stronger the cord,
the faster the ball can twirl before the cord breaks. Also, we
expect a more massive ball to break the cord at a lower
speed. (Imagine whirling a bowling ball!)
Because the force causing the centripetal acceleration in
this case is the force T exerted by the cord on the ball, Equation 6.1 yields for Fr  mar

The Conical Pendulum

A small object of mass m is suspended from a string of length
L. The object revolves with constant speed v in a horizontal
circle of radius r, as shown in Figure 6.4. (Because the string
sweeps out the surface of a cone, the system is known as a
conical pendulum.) Find an expression for v.

Let us choose  to represent the angle between
string and vertical. In the free-body diagram shown in Figure
6.4, the force T exerted by the string is resolved into a vertical
component T cos  and a horizontal component T sin  acting toward the center of revolution. Because the object does

the upward vertical component of T must balance the downward force of gravity. Therefore,

Because the force providing the centripetal acceleration in
this example is the component T sin , we can use Newton’s
second law and Equation 6.1 to obtain

What Is the Maximum Speed of the Car?

A 1 500-kg car moving on a ﬂat, horizontal road negotiates a
curve, as illustrated in Figure 6.5. If the radius of the curve is
35.0 m and the coefﬁcient of static friction between the tires

and dry pavement is 0.500, ﬁnd the maximum speed the car
can have and still make the turn successfully.

Solution From experience, we should expect a maximum
speed less than 50 m/s. (A convenient mental conversion is
that 1 m/s is roughly 2 mi/h.) In this case, the force that enables the car to remain in its circular path is the force of static friction. (Because no slipping occurs at the point of contact between road and tires, the acting force is a force of
static friction directed toward the center of the curve. If this
force of static friction were zero — for example, if the car
were on an icy road — the car would continue in a straight
line and slide off the road.) Hence, from Equation 6.1 we
have

CHAPTER 6

Circular Motion and Other Applications of Newton’s Laws

Note that the maximum speed does not depend on the mass
of the car. That is why curved highways do not need multiple
speed limit signs to cover the various masses of vehicles using
the road.

EXAMPLE 6.5

Exercise

On a wet day, the car begins to skid on the curve
when its speed reaches 8.00 m/s. What is the coefﬁcient of
static friction in this case?

Answer

0.187.

The Banked Exit Ramp

A civil engineer wishes to design a curved exit ramp for a
highway in such a way that a car will not have to rely on friction to round the curve without skidding. In other words, a
car moving at the designated speed can negotiate the curve
even when the road is covered with ice. Such a ramp is usually banked; this means the roadway is tilted toward the inside
of the curve. Suppose the designated speed for the ramp is to
be 13.4 m/s (30.0 mi/h) and the radius of the curve is
50.0 m. At what angle should the curve be banked?

Solution On a level (unbanked) road, the force that
causes the centripetal acceleration is the force of static friction between car and road, as we saw in the previous example. However, if the road is banked at an angle , as shown in
Figure 6.6, the normal force n has a horizontal component

n sin  pointing toward the center of the curve. Because the
ramp is to be designed so that the force of static friction is
zero, only the component n sin  causes the centripetal acceleration. Hence, Newton’s second law written for the radial direction gives

the sum of the forces exerted by the road on the wheels.

If a car rounds the curve at a speed less than 13.4 m/s,
friction is needed to keep it from sliding down the bank (to
the left in Fig. 6.6). A driver who attempts to negotiate the
curve at a speed greater than 13.4 m/s has to depend on friction to keep from sliding up the bank (to the right in Fig.
6.6). The banking angle is independent of the mass of the vehicle negotiating the curve.

and has a magnitude

A pilot of mass m in a jet aircraft executes a loop-the-loop, as
shown in Figure 6.8a. In this maneuver, the aircraft moves in
a vertical circle of radius 2.70 km at a constant speed of

Express your answers in terms of the weight of the pilot mg.

 Fr  nbot  mg  m

Solution

We expect the answer for (a) to be greater than
that for (b) because at the bottom of the loop the normal
and gravitational forces act in opposite directions, whereas at
the top of the loop these two forces act in the same direction.
It is the vector sum of these two forces that gives the force of
constant magnitude that keeps the pilot moving in a circular
path. To yield net force vectors with the same magnitude, the
normal force at the bottom (where the normal and gravitational forces are in opposite directions) must be greater than
that at the top (where the normal and gravitational forces are
in the same direction). (a) The free-body diagram for the pilot at the bottom of the loop is shown in Figure 6.8b. The
only forces acting on him are the downward force of gravity
Fg  mg and the upward force n bot exerted by the seat. Because the net upward force that provides the centripetal ac-

weight that is greater than his true weight by a factor of 2.91.
(b) The free-body diagram for the pilot at the top of the

shown in Figure 6.10. The vector Fr is directed toward the center of the circle and is
responsible for the centripetal acceleration. The vector Ft tangent to the circle is responsible for the tangential acceleration, which represents a change in the speed of
the particle with time. The following example demonstrates this type of motion.

MOTION IN ACCELERATED FRAMES

When Newton’s laws of motion were introduced in Chapter 5, we emphasized that
they are valid only when observations are made in an inertial frame of reference.
In this section, we analyze how an observer in a noninertial frame of reference
(one that is accelerating) applies Newton’s second law.

6.3

Motion in Accelerated Frames

To understand the motion of a system that is noninertial because an object is
moving along a curved path, consider a car traveling along a highway at a high
speed and approaching a curved exit ramp, as shown in Figure 6.12a. As the car
takes the sharp left turn onto the ramp, a person sitting in the passenger seat
slides to the right and hits the door. At that point, the force exerted on her by the
door keeps her from being ejected from the car. What causes her to move toward
the door? A popular, but improper, explanation is that some mysterious force acting from left to right pushes her outward. (This is often called the “centrifugal”
force, but we shall not use this term because it often creates confusion.) The passenger invents this ﬁctitious force to explain what is going on in her accelerated
frame of reference, as shown in Figure 6.12b. (The driver also experiences this effect but holds on to the steering wheel to keep from sliding to the right.)
The phenomenon is correctly explained as follows. Before the car enters the
ramp, the passenger is moving in a straight-line path. As the car enters the ramp
and travels a curved path, the passenger tends to move along the original straightline path. This is in accordance with Newton’s ﬁrst law: The natural tendency of a
body is to continue moving in a straight line. However, if a sufﬁciently large force
(toward the center of curvature) acts on the passenger, as in Figure 6.12c, she will
move in a curved path along with the car. The origin of this force is the force of
friction between her and the car seat. If this frictional force is not large enough,
she will slide to the right as the car turns to the left under her. Eventually, she encounters the door, which provides a force large enough to enable her to follow the
same curved path as the car. She slides toward the door not because of some mysterious outward force but because the force of friction is not sufﬁciently great
to allow her to travel along the circular path followed by the car.
In general, if a particle moves with an acceleration a relative to an observer in
an inertial frame, that observer may use Newton’s second law and correctly claim
that F  ma. If another observer in an accelerated frame tries to apply Newton’s
second law to the motion of the particle, the person must introduce ﬁctitious
forces to make Newton’s second law work. These forces “invented” by the observer
in the accelerating frame appear to be real. However, we emphasize that these ﬁctitious forces do not exist when the motion is observed in an inertial frame.
Fictitious forces are used only in an accelerating frame and do not represent “real”
forces acting on the particle. (By real forces, we mean the interaction of the particle with its environment.) If the ﬁctitious forces are properly deﬁned in the accelerating frame, the description of motion in this frame is equivalent to the description given by an inertial observer who considers only real forces. Usually, we
analyze motions using inertial reference frames, but there are cases in which it is
more convenient to use an accelerating frame.

move toward the right-hand door? (b) From the frame of reference of the passenger, a (ﬁctitious) force pushes her toward the right door. (c) Relative to the reference frame of the Earth,
the car seat applies a leftward force to the passenger, causing her to change direction along with

Fictitious Forces in Linear Motion

A small sphere of mass m is hung by a cord from the ceiling
of a boxcar that is accelerating to the right, as shown in Figure 6.13. According to the inertial observer at rest (Fig.
6.13a), the forces on the sphere are the force T exerted by
the cord and the force of gravity. The inertial observer concludes that the acceleration of the sphere is the same as that
of the boxcar and that this acceleration is provided by the
horizontal component of T. Also, the vertical component of
T balances the force of gravity. Therefore, she writes Newton’s second law as F  T  m g  ma, which in component form becomes

Because the deﬂection of the cord from the vertical serves as
a measure of acceleration, a simple pendulum can be used as an
accelerometer.
According to the noninertial observer riding in the car
(Fig. 6.13b), the cord still makes an angle  with the vertical;
however, to her the sphere is at rest and so its acceleration is
zero. Therefore, she introduces a ﬁctitious force to balance
the horizontal component of T and claims that the net force
on the sphere is zero! In this noninertial frame of reference,
Newton’s second law in component form yields
Noninertial observer

Thus, by solving (1) and (2) simultaneously for a, the inertial
observer can determine the magnitude of the car’s acceleration through the relationship

According to a noninertial observer attached to the

Therefore, she must introduce a ﬁctitious outward force of

string. According to her, the net force on the block is zero,

Suppose a block of mass m lying on a horizontal, frictionless

the turntable, as shown in Figure 6.14. According to an inertial observer, if the block rotates uniformly, it undergoes an
acceleration of magnitude v 2/r, where v is its linear speed.
The inertial observer concludes that this centripetal acceleration is provided by the force T exerted by the string and
writes Newton’s second law as T  mv 2/r.

MOTION IN THE PRESENCE OF RESISTIVE FORCES

In the preceding chapter we described the force of kinetic friction exerted on an
object moving on some surface. We completely ignored any interaction between
the object and the medium through which it moves. Now let us consider the effect
of that medium, which can be either a liquid or a gas. The medium exerts a resistive force R on the object moving through it. Some examples are the air resistance associated with moving vehicles (sometimes called air drag) and the viscous
forces that act on objects moving through a liquid. The magnitude of R depends
on such factors as the speed of the object, and the direction of R is always opposite
the direction of motion of the object relative to the medium. The magnitude of R
nearly always increases with increasing speed.
The magnitude of the resistive force can depend on speed in a complex way,
and here we consider only two situations. In the ﬁrst situation, we assume the resistive force is proportional to the speed of the moving object; this assumption is
valid for objects falling slowly through a liquid and for very small objects, such as
dust particles, moving through air. In the second situation, we assume a resistive
force that is proportional to the square of the speed of the moving object; large
objects, such as a skydiver moving through air in free fall, experience such a force.

Resistive Force Proportional to Object Speed
If we assume that the resistive force acting on an object moving through a liquid
or gas is proportional to the object’s speed, then the magnitude of the resistive
force can be expressed as
R  bv

(6.2)

where v is the speed of the object and b is a constant whose value depends on the
properties of the medium and on the shape and dimensions of the object. If the
object is a sphere of radius r, then b is proportional to r.
Consider a small sphere of mass m released from rest in a liquid, as in Figure
6.15a. Assuming that the only forces acting on the sphere are the resistive force bv
and the force of gravity Fg , let us describe its motion.1 Applying Newton’s second
law to the vertical motion, choosing the downward direction to be positive, and
noting that Fy  mg  bv, we obtain

This equation is called a differential equation, and the methods of solving it may not
be familiar to you as yet. However, note that initially, when v  0, the resistive
force  bv is also zero and the acceleration dv/dt is simply g. As t increases, the resistive force increases and the acceleration decreases. Eventually, the acceleration
becomes zero when the magnitude of the resistive force equals the sphere’s
weight. At this point, the sphere reaches its terminal speed vt , and from then on
1

There is also a buoyant force acting on the submerged object. This force is constant, and its magnitude
is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. This force changes the apparent weight of the sphere by a
constant factor, so we will ignore the force here. We discuss buoyant forces in Chapter 15.

This gives

speed. This can be seen by noting that when t  , Equation 6.5 yields v  0.632vt .
We can check that Equation 6.5 is a solution to Equation 6.4 by direct differentiation:

Equation 6.5 shows that our solution satisﬁes the differential equation.

A small sphere of mass 2.00 g is released from rest in a large

Air Drag at High Speeds
For objects moving at high speeds through air, such as airplanes, sky divers, cars,
and baseballs, the resistive force is approximately proportional to the square of the
speed. In these situations, the magnitude of the resistive force can be expressed as
R  12D Av2

CHAPTER 6

Circular Motion and Other Applications of Newton’s Laws

where is the density of air, A is the cross-sectional area of the falling object measured in a plane perpendicular to its motion, and D is a dimensionless empirical
quantity called the drag coefﬁcient. The drag coefﬁcient has a value of about 0.5 for
spherical objects but can have a value as great as 2 for irregularly shaped objects.
Let us analyze the motion of an object in free fall subject to an upward air
resistive force of magnitude R  12 D Av2. Suppose an object of mass m is released from rest. As Figure 6.16 shows, the object experiences two external forces:
the downward force of gravity Fg  mg and the upward resistive force R. (There is
also an upward buoyant force that we neglect.) Hence, the magnitude of the net
force is

is, when R   Fg or R  mg. Before this occurs, the acceleration

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 6.12
Consider a sky surfer who jumps from a plane with her feet
attached ﬁrmly to her surfboard, does some tricks, and then
opens her parachute. Describe the forces acting on her during these maneuvers.

Solution When the surfer ﬁrst steps out of the plane, she
has no vertical velocity. The downward force of gravity causes
her to accelerate toward the ground. As her downward speed
increases, so does the upward resistive force exerted by the
air on her body and the board. This upward force reduces
their acceleration, and so their speed increases more slowly.
Eventually, they are going so fast that the upward resistive
force matches the downward force of gravity. Now the net
force is zero and they no longer accelerate, but reach their
terminal speed. At some point after reaching terminal speed,
she opens her parachute, resulting in a drastic increase in the
upward resistive force. The net force (and thus the acceleration) is now upward, in the direction opposite the direction
of the velocity. This causes the downward velocity to decrease
rapidly; this means the resistive force on the chute also decreases. Eventually the upward resistive force and the downward force of gravity balance each other and a much smaller
terminal speed is reached, permitting a safe landing.
(Contrary to popular belief, the velocity vector of a sky
diver never points upward. You may have seen a videotape
in which a sky diver appeared to “rocket” upward once the
chute opened. In fact, what happened is that the diver
slowed down while the person holding the camera continued falling at high speed.)

EXAMPLE 6.13

A sky surfer takes advantage of the upward force of the air on her
board. (

Falling Coffee Filters

The dependence of resistive force on speed is an empirical
relationship. In other words, it is based on observation rather
than on a theoretical model. A series of stacked ﬁlters is
dropped, and the terminal speeds are measured. Table 6.2

presents data for these coffee ﬁlters as they fall through the
air. The time constant is small, so that a dropped ﬁlter
quickly reaches terminal speed. Each ﬁlter has a mass of
1.64 g. When the ﬁlters are nested together, they stack in

such a way that the front-facing surface area does not increase. Determine the relationship between the resistive force
exerted by the air and the speed of the falling ﬁlters.

Solution At terminal speed, the upward resistive force balances the downward force of gravity. So, a single ﬁlter falling
at its terminal speed experiences a resistive force of

Two ﬁlters nested together experience 0.032 2 N of resistive
force, and so forth. A graph of the resistive force on the ﬁlters as a function of terminal speed is shown in Figure 6.17a.
A straight line would not be a good ﬁt, indicating that the resistive force is not proportional to the speed. The curved line
is for a second-order polynomial, indicating a proportionality
of the resistive force to the square of the speed. This proportionality is more clearly seen in Figure 6.17b, in which the resistive force is plotted as a function of the square of the terminal speed.

A pitcher hurls a 0.145-kg baseball past a batter at 40.2 m/s

Solution

We do not expect the air to exert a huge force
on the ball, and so the resistive force we calculate from Equation 6.6 should not be more than a few newtons. First, we
must determine the drag coefﬁcient D. We do this by imagining that we drop the baseball and allow it to reach terminal
speed. We solve Equation 6.9 for D and substitute the appropriate values for m, vt , and A from Table 6.1. Taking the density of air as 1.29 kg/m3, we obtain

NUMERICAL MODELING IN PARTICLE DYNAMICS 2

As we have seen in this and the preceding chapter, the study of the dynamics of a
particle focuses on describing the position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of
time. Cause-and-effect relationships exist among these quantities: Velocity causes
position to change, and acceleration causes velocity to change. Because acceleration is the direct result of applied forces, any analysis of the dynamics of a particle
usually begins with an evaluation of the net force being exerted on the particle.
Up till now, we have used what is called the analytical method to investigate the
position, velocity, and acceleration of a moving particle. Let us review this method
brieﬂy before learning about a second way of approaching problems in dynamics.
(Because we conﬁne our discussion to one-dimensional motion in this section,
boldface notation will not be used for vector quantities.)
If a particle of mass m moves under the inﬂuence of a net force F, Newton’s
second law tells us that the acceleration of the particle is a  F/m. In general, we
apply the analytical method to a dynamics problem using the following procedure:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Sum all the forces acting on the particle to get the net force F.
Use this net force to determine the acceleration from the relationship a  F/m.
Use this acceleration to determine the velocity from the relationship dv/dt  a.
Use this velocity to determine the position from the relationship dx/dt  v.
The following straightforward example illustrates this method.

EXAMPLE 6.15

An Object Falling in a Vacuum — Analytical Method

Consider a particle falling in a vacuum under the inﬂuence
of the force of gravity, as shown in Figure 6.18. Use the analytical method to ﬁnd the acceleration, velocity, and position of
the particle.
2

Solution The only force acting on the particle is the
downward force of gravity of magnitude Fg , which is also the
net force. Applying Newton’s second law, we set the net force
acting on the particle equal to the mass of the particle times

its acceleration (taking upward to be the positive y direction):
Fg  ma y  mg

In these expressions, yi and vyi represent the position and
speed of the particle at t i  0.

Thus, a y  g, which means the acceleration is constant. Because dv y /dt  a y, we see that dv y /dt  g, which may be integrated to yield
v y(t)  v yi  gt
Then, because v y  dy/dt, the position of the particle is obtained from another integration, which yields the well-known

The analytical method is straightforward for many physical situations. In the
“real world,” however, complications often arise that make analytical solutions difﬁcult and perhaps beyond the mathematical abilities of most students taking introductory physics. For example, the net force acting on a particle may depend on
the particle’s position, as in cases where the gravitational acceleration varies with
height. Or the force may vary with velocity, as in cases of resistive forces caused by
motion through a liquid or gas.
Another complication arises because the expressions relating acceleration, velocity, position, and time are differential equations rather than algebraic ones. Differential equations are usually solved using integral calculus and other special
techniques that introductory students may not have mastered.
When such situations arise, scientists often use a procedure called numerical
modeling to study motion. The simplest numerical model is called the Euler
method, after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783).

The Euler Method
In the Euler method for solving differential equations, derivatives are approximated as ratios of ﬁnite differences. Considering a small increment of time t, we
can approximate the relationship between a particle’s speed and the magnitude of
its acceleration as
a(t) ⬇

v
v(t  t)  v(t)

t
t

Then the speed v(t  t) of the particle at the end of the time interval t is approximately equal to the speed v(t) at the beginning of the time interval plus the
magnitude of the acceleration during the interval multiplied by t:
v(t  t) ⬇ v(t)  a(t)t

(6.10)

Because the acceleration is a function of time, this estimate of v(t  t) is accurate
only if the time interval t is short enough that the change in acceleration during
it is very small (as is discussed later). Of course, Equation 6.10 is exact if the acceleration is constant.

6.5

Numerical Modeling in Particle Dynamics

171

The position x(t  t) of the particle at the end of the interval t can be
found in the same manner:
v(t) ⬇

x
x(t  t)  x(t)

t
t

x(t  t) ⬇ x(t)  v(t)t
1
2

(6.11)

a(t)2

You may be tempted to add the term
to this result to make it look like
the familiar kinematics equation, but this term is not included in the Euler
method because t is assumed to be so small that t 2 is nearly zero.
If the acceleration at any instant t is known, the particle’s velocity and position
at a time t  t can be calculated from Equations 6.10 and 6.11. The calculation
then proceeds in a series of ﬁnite steps to determine the velocity and position at
any later time. The acceleration is determined from the net force acting on the
particle, and this force may depend on position, velocity, or time:
a(x, v, t) 

 F(x, v, t)

(6.12)

m

It is convenient to set up the numerical solution to this kind of problem by
numbering the steps and entering the calculations in a table, a procedure that is illustrated in Table 6.3.
The equations in the table can be entered into a spreadsheet and the calculations performed row by row to determine the velocity, position, and acceleration
as functions of time. The calculations can also be carried out by using a program
written in either BASIC, C, or FORTRAN or by using commercially available
mathematics packages for personal computers. Many small increments can be
taken, and accurate results can usually be obtained with the help of a computer.
Graphs of velocity versus time or position versus time can be displayed to help you
visualize the motion.
One advantage of the Euler method is that the dynamics is not obscured — the
fundamental relationships between acceleration and force, velocity and acceleration, and position and velocity are clearly evident. Indeed, these relationships
form the heart of the calculations. There is no need to use advanced mathematics,
and the basic physics governs the dynamics.
The Euler method is completely reliable for inﬁnitesimally small time increments, but for practical reasons a ﬁnite increment size must be chosen. For the ﬁnite difference approximation of Equation 6.10 to be valid, the time increment
must be small enough that the acceleration can be approximated as being constant during the increment. We can determine an appropriate size for the time in-

crement by examining the particular problem being investigated. The criterion for
the size of the time increment may need to be changed during the course of the
motion. In practice, however, we usually choose a time increment appropriate to
the initial conditions and use the same value throughout the calculations.
The size of the time increment inﬂuences the accuracy of the result, but unfortunately it is not easy to determine the accuracy of an Euler-method solution
without a knowledge of the correct analytical solution. One method of determining the accuracy of the numerical solution is to repeat the calculations with a
smaller time increment and compare results. If the two calculations agree to a certain number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, you can assume that the results are correct to
that precision.

SUMMARY
Newton’s second law applied to a particle moving in uniform circular motion states
that the net force causing the particle to undergo a centripetal acceleration is

 Fr  mar 

mv2
r

(6.1)

You should be able to use this formula in situations where the force providing the
centripetal acceleration could be the force of gravity, a force of friction, a force of
string tension, or a normal force.
A particle moving in nonuniform circular motion has both a centripetal component of acceleration and a nonzero tangential component of acceleration. In
the case of a particle rotating in a vertical circle, the force of gravity provides the
tangential component of acceleration and part or all of the centripetal component
of acceleration. Be sure you understand the directions and magnitudes of the velocity and acceleration vectors for nonuniform circular motion.
An observer in a noninertial (accelerating) frame of reference must introduce
ﬁctitious forces when applying Newton’s second law in that frame. If these ﬁctitious forces are properly deﬁned, the description of motion in the noninertial
frame is equivalent to that made by an observer in an inertial frame. However, the
observers in the two frames do not agree on the causes of the motion. You should
be able to distinguish between inertial and noninertial frames and identify the ﬁctitious forces acting in a noninertial frame.
A body moving through a liquid or gas experiences a resistive force that is
speed-dependent. This resistive force, which opposes the motion, generally increases with speed. The magnitude of the resistive force depends on the shape of
the body and on the properties of the medium through which the body is moving.
In the limiting case for a falling body, when the magnitude of the resistive force
equals the body’s weight, the body reaches its terminal speed. You should be able
to apply Newton’s laws to analyze the motion of objects moving under the inﬂuence of resistive forces. You may need to apply Euler’s method if the force depends on velocity, as it does for air drag.

length of time is the ball in ﬂight? The cup is due south
of the golfer ’s location, and he would have a hole-inone if the Earth were not rotating. As shown in Figure

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
6.1 No. The tangential acceleration changes just the speed
part of the velocity vector. For the car to move in a circle, the direction of its velocity vector must change, and
the only way this can happen is for there to be a centripetal acceleration.
6.2 (a) The ball travels in a circular path that has a larger radius than the original circular path, and so there must
be some external force causing the change in the velocity vector’s direction. The external force must not be as
strong as the original tension in the string because if it
were, the ball would follow the original path. (b) The
ball again travels in an arc, implying some kind of external force. As in part (a), the external force is directed toward the center of the new arc and not toward the center of the original circular path. (c) The ball undergoes
an abrupt change in velocity — from tangent to the circle to perpendicular to it — and so must have experienced a large force that had one component opposite
the ball’s velocity (tangent to the circle) and another
component radially outward. (d) The ball travels in a
straight line tangent to the original path. If there is an
external force, it cannot have a component perpendicular to this line because if it did, the path would curve. In

fact, if the string breaks and there is no other force acting on the ball, Newton’s ﬁrst law says the ball will travel
along such a tangent line at constant speed.
6.3 At 훽 the path is along the circumference of the larger
circle. Therefore, the wire must be exerting a force on
the bead directed toward the center of the circle. Because the speed is constant, there is no tangential force
component. At 훾 the path is not curved, and so the wire
exerts no force on the bead. At 훿 the path is again
curved, and so the wire is again exerting a force on the
bead. This time the force is directed toward the center
of the smaller circle. Because the radius of this circle is
smaller, the magnitude of the force exerted on the bead
is larger here than at 훽.

he concept of energy is one of the most important topics in science and engineering. In everyday life, we think of energy in terms of fuel for transportation
and heating, electricity for lights and appliances, and foods for consumption.
However, these ideas do not really deﬁne energy. They merely tell us that fuels are
needed to do a job and that those fuels provide us with something we call energy.
In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce the concept of work. Work is done by a force
acting on an object when the point of application of that force moves through
some distance and the force has a component along the line of motion. Next, we
deﬁne kinetic energy, which is energy an object possesses because of its motion. In
general, we can think of energy as the capacity that an object has for performing
work. We shall see that the concepts of work and kinetic energy can be applied to
the dynamics of a mechanical system without resorting to Newton’s laws. In a complex situation, in fact, the “energy approach” can often allow a much simpler
analysis than the direct application of Newton’s second law. However, it is important to note that the work – energy concepts are based on Newton’s laws and therefore allow us to make predictions that are always in agreement with these laws.
This alternative method of describing motion is especially useful when the
force acting on a particle varies with the position of the particle. In this case, the acceleration is not constant, and we cannot apply the kinematic equations developed
in Chapter 2. Often, a particle in nature is subject to a force that varies with the position of the particle. Such forces include the gravitational force and the force exerted on an object attached to a spring. Although we could analyze situations like
these by applying numerical methods such as those discussed in Section 6.5, utilizing the ideas of work and energy is often much simpler. We describe techniques for
treating complicated systems with the help of an extremely important theorem
called the work – kinetic energy theorem, which is the central topic of this chapter.

WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE

Almost all the terms we have used thus far — velocity, acceleration, force, and so
on — convey nearly the same meaning in physics as they do in everyday life. Now,
however, we encounter a term whose meaning in physics is distinctly different
from its everyday meaning. That new term is work.
To understand what work means to the physicist, consider the situation illustrated in Figure 7.1. A force is applied to a chalkboard eraser, and the eraser slides
along the tray. If we are interested in how effective the force is in moving the

eraser, we need to consider not only the magnitude of the force but also its direction. If we assume that the magnitude of the applied force is the same in all three
photographs, it is clear that the push applied in Figure 7.1b does more to move
the eraser than the push in Figure 7.1a. On the other hand, Figure 7.1c shows a
situation in which the applied force does not move the eraser at all, regardless of
how hard it is pushed. (Unless, of course, we apply a force so great that we break
something.) So, in analyzing forces to determine the work they do, we must consider the vector nature of forces. We also need to know how far the eraser moves
along the tray if we want to determine the work required to cause that motion.
Moving the eraser 3 m requires more work than moving it 2 cm.
Let us examine the situation in Figure 7.2, where an object undergoes a displacement d along a straight line while acted on by a constant force F that makes
an angle ␪ with d.

Figure 7.2 If an object undergoes a displacement d under the

displacement and the magnitude of the displacement:

As an example of the distinction between this deﬁnition of work and our
everyday understanding of the word, consider holding a heavy chair at arm’s
length for 3 min. At the end of this time interval, your tired arms may lead you to
think that you have done a considerable amount of work on the chair. According
to our deﬁnition, however, you have done no work on it whatsoever.1 You exert a
force to support the chair, but you do not move it. A force does no work on an object if the object does not move. This can be seen by noting that if d ⫽ 0, Equation
7.1 gives W ⫽ 0 — the situation depicted in Figure 7.1c.
Also note from Equation 7.1 that the work done by a force on a moving object
is zero when the force applied is perpendicular to the object’s displacement. That
is, if ␪ ⫽ 90°, then W ⫽ 0 because cos 90° ⫽ 0. For example, in Figure 7.3, the
work done by the normal force on the object and the work done by the force of
gravity on the object are both zero because both forces are perpendicular to the
displacement and have zero components in the direction of d.
The sign of the work also depends on the direction of F relative to d. The
work done by the applied force is positive when the vector associated with the
component F cos ␪ is in the same direction as the displacement. For example,
when an object is lifted, the work done by the applied force is positive because the
direction of that force is upward, that is, in the same direction as the displacement. When the vector associated with the component F cos ␪ is in the direction
opposite the displacement, W is negative. For example, as an object is lifted, the
work done by the gravitational force on the object is negative. The factor cos ␪ in
the deﬁnition of W (Eq. 7.1) automatically takes care of the sign. It is important to
note that work is an energy transfer; if energy is transferred to the system (object), W is positive; if energy is transferred from the system, W is negative.

Actually, you do work while holding the chair at arm’s length because your muscles are continuously
contracting and relaxing; this means that they are exerting internal forces on your arm. Thus, work is
being done by your body — but internally on itself rather than on the chair.

If an applied force F acts along the direction of the displacement, then ␪ ⫽ 0

Work is a scalar quantity, and its units are force multiplied by length. Therefore, the SI unit of work is the newtonⴢmeter (N⭈m). This combination of units is
used so frequently that it has been given a name of its own: the joule (J).

Quick Quiz 7.1
Can the component of a force that gives an object a centripetal acceleration do any work on
the object? (One such force is that exerted by the Sun on the Earth that holds the Earth in
a circular orbit around the Sun.)

In general, a particle may be moving with either a constant or a varying velocity under the inﬂuence of several forces. In these cases, because work is a scalar
quantity, the total work done as the particle undergoes some displacement is the
algebraic sum of the amounts of work done by all the forces.

Solution

Because they aid us in clarifying which forces are
acting on the object being considered, drawings like Figure

work (Eq. 7.1):

One thing we should learn from this problem is that the
normal force n, the force of gravity Fg ⫽ mg, and the upward
component of the applied force (50.0 N) (sin 30.0°) do no
work on the vacuum cleaner because these forces are perpendicular to its displacement.

THE SCALAR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS

Because of the way the force and displacement vectors are combined in Equation

This tool allows us to indicate how F and d interact in a way that depends on how
close to parallel they happen to be. We write this scalar product Fⴢd. (Because of
the dot symbol, the scalar product is often called the dot product.) Thus, we can
express Equation 7.1 as a scalar product:
W ⫽ Fⴢd ⫽ Fd cos ␪

(7.2)

In other words, Fⴢd (read “F dot d”) is a shorthand notation for Fd cos ␪.

Scalar product of any two vectors
A and B

In general, the scalar product of any two vectors A and B is a scalar quantity
equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the
angle ␪ between them:
AⴢB  AB cos ␪

(7.3)

This relationship is shown in Figure 7.6. Note that A and B need not have the
same units.

7.2

The Scalar Product of Two Vectors

In Figure 7.6, B cos ␪ is the projection of B onto A. Therefore, Equation 7.3
says that A ⴢ B is the product of the magnitude of A and the projection of B onto
A.2
From the right-hand side of Equation 7.3 we also see that the scalar product is
commutative.3 That is,
AⴢB ⫽ BⴢA

The order of the dot product can
be reversed

Finally, the scalar product obeys the distributive law of multiplication, so
that
Aⴢ(B ⫹ C) ⫽ AⴢB ⫹ AⴢC

B

The dot product is simple to evaluate from Equation 7.3 when A is either perpendicular or parallel to B. If A is perpendicular to B (␪ ⫽ 90°), then AⴢB ⫽ 0.
(The equality AⴢB = 0 also holds in the more trivial case when either A or B is
zero.) If vector A is parallel to vector B and the two point in the same direction
(␪ ⫽ 0), then AⴢB ⫽ AB. If vector A is parallel to vector B but the two point in opposite directions (␪ ⫽ 180°), then AⴢB ⫽ ⫺ AB. The scalar product is negative
when 90° ⬍ ␪ ⬍ 180°.
The unit vectors i, j, and k, which were deﬁned in Chapter 3, lie in the positive x, y, and z directions, respectively, of a right-handed coordinate system. Therefore, it follows from the deﬁnition of A ⴢ B that the scalar products of these unit
vectors are
iⴢi ⫽ jⴢj ⫽ kⴢk ⫽ 1

(7.4)

iⴢj ⫽ iⴢk ⫽ jⴢk ⫽ 0

(7.5)

Equations 3.18 and 3.19 state that two vectors A and B can be expressed in
component vector form as
A ⫽ Ax i ⫹ A y j ⫹ Az k
B ⫽ Bx i ⫹ B y j ⫹ Bz k
Using the information given in Equations 7.4 and 7.5 shows that the scalar product of A and B reduces to
AⴢB ⫽ Ax Bx ⫹ Ay By ⫹ Az Bz

(7.6)

(Details of the derivation are left for you in Problem 7.10.) In the special case in
which A ⫽ B, we see that
AⴢA ⫽ Ax2 ⫹ Ay2 ⫹ Az2 ⫽ A2

Quick Quiz 7.3
If the dot product of two vectors is positive, must the vectors have positive rectangular components?

This is equivalent to stating that AⴢB equals the product of the magnitude of B and the projection of
A onto B.

This may seem obvious, but in Chapter 11 you will see another way of combining vectors that proves
useful in physics and is not commutative.

WORK DONE BY A VARYING FORCE

Consider a particle being displaced along the x axis under the action of a varying
force. The particle is displaced in the direction of increasing x from x ⫽ xi to x ⫽
xf . In such a situation, we cannot use W ⫽ (F cos ␪)d to calculate the work done by
the force because this relationship applies only when F is constant in magnitude
and direction. However, if we imagine that the particle undergoes a very small displacement ⌬x, shown in Figure 7.7a, then the x component of the force Fx is approximately constant over this interval; for this small displacement, we can express
the work done by the force as
⌬W ⫽ Fx ⌬x
This is just the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 7.7a. If we imagine that the
Fx versus x curve is divided into a large number of such intervals, then the total
work done for the displacement from xi to xf is approximately equal to the sum of
a large number of such terms:
xf

W  ⌺ Fx ⌬x

7.3
Area = ∆A = Fx ∆x

Figure 7.7

(a) The work done by the force component Fx
for the small displacement ⌬x is Fx ⌬x, which equals the area
of the shaded rectangle. The total work done for the displacement from x i to xf is approximately equal to the sum of
the areas of all the rectangles. (b) The work done by the
component Fx of the varying force as the particle moves from
xi to xf is exactly equal to the area under this curve.

Graphical Solution The minus sign in the formula for
the force indicates that the probe is attracted to the Sun. Because the probe is moving away from the Sun, we expect to
calculate a negative value for the work done on it.

A common physical system for which the force varies with position is shown in Figure 7.10. A block on a horizontal, frictionless surface is connected to a spring. If
the spring is either stretched or compressed a small distance from its unstretched
(equilibrium) conﬁguration, it exerts on the block a force of magnitude
Fs ⫽ ⫺kx

(7.9)

where x is the displacement of the block from its unstretched (x ⫽ 0) position and
k is a positive constant called the force constant of the spring. In other words, the
force required to stretch or compress a spring is proportional to the amount of
stretch or compression x. This force law for springs, known as Hooke’s law, is
valid only in the limiting case of small displacements. The value of k is a measure
of the stiffness of the spring. Stiff springs have large k values, and soft springs have
small k values.

Quick Quiz 7.4
What are the units for k, the force constant in Hooke’s law?

The negative sign in Equation 7.9 signiﬁes that the force exerted by the spring
is always directed opposite the displacement. When x ⬎ 0 as in Figure 7.10a, the
spring force is directed to the left, in the negative x direction. When x ⬍ 0 as in
Figure 7.10c, the spring force is directed to the right, in the positive x direction.
When x ⫽ 0 as in Figure 7.10b, the spring is unstretched and Fs ⫽ 0. Because the
spring force always acts toward the equilibrium position (x ⫽ 0), it sometimes is
called a restoring force. If the spring is compressed until the block is at the point
⫺ x max and is then released, the block moves from ⫺ x max through zero to ⫹ x max.
If the spring is instead stretched until the block is at the point x max and is then released, the block moves from ⫹ x max through zero to ⫺ x max. It then reverses direction, returns to ⫹ x max, and continues oscillating back and forth.
Suppose the block has been pushed to the left a distance x max from equilibrium and is then released. Let us calculate the work Ws done by the spring force as
the block moves from xi ⫽ ⫺ x max to xf ⫽ 0. Applying Equation 7.7 and assuming
the block may be treated as a particle, we obtain

The force exerted by a spring on a block varies with the block’s displacement x

(c) When x is negative (compressed spring), the spring force is directed to the right. (d) Graph
of Fs versus x for the block – spring system. The work done by the spring force as the block moves

where we have used the indeﬁnite integral x ndx ⫽ x n⫹1/(n ⫹ 1) with n ⫽ 1. The
work done by the spring force is positive because the force is in the same direction
as the displacement (both are to the right). When we consider the work done by

Work Done by a Varying Force

Ws ⫽ ⫺ 12 kx 2max because for this part of the motion the displacement is to the right
and the spring force is to the left. Therefore, the net work done by the spring force
as the block moves from xi ⫽ ⫺ x max to xf ⫽ x max is zero.
Figure 7.10d is a plot of Fs versus x. The work calculated in Equation 7.10 is
the area of the shaded triangle, corresponding to the displacement from ⫺ x max to
0. Because the triangle has base x max and height kx max, its area is 12 kx2max , the work
done by the spring as given by Equation 7.10.

For example, if the spring has a force constant of 80 N/m and is compressed
3.0 cm from equilibrium, the work done by the spring force as the block moves
from xi ⫽ ⫺ 3.0 cm to its unstretched position xf ⫽ 0 is 3.6 ⫻ 10⫺2 J. From Equation 7.11 we also see that the work done by the spring force is zero for any motion
that ends where it began (xi ⫽ xf ). We shall make use of this important result in
Chapter 8, in which we describe the motion of this system in greater detail.
Equations 7.10 and 7.11 describe the work done by the spring on the block.
Now let us consider the work done on the spring by an external agent that stretches
the spring very slowly from xi ⫽ 0 to xf ⫽ x max, as in Figure 7.11. We can calculate
this work by noting that at any value of the displacement, the applied force Fapp is
equal to and opposite the spring force Fs , so that Fapp ⫽ ⫺ (⫺ kx) ⫽ kx. Therefore,

EXAMPLE 7.6

Measuring k for a Spring

A common technique used to measure the force constant of
a spring is described in Figure 7.12. The spring is hung vertically, and an object of mass m is attached to its lower end. Under the action of the “load” mg, the spring stretches a distance d from its equilibrium position. Because the spring
force is upward (opposite the displacement), it must balance
the downward force of gravity m g when the system is at rest.

KINETIC ENERGY AND THE
WORK – KINETIC ENERGY THEOREM

It can be difﬁcult to use Newton’s second law to solve motion problems involving
complex forces. An alternative approach is to relate the speed of a moving particle
to its displacement under the inﬂuence of some net force. If the work done by the
net force on a particle can be calculated for a given displacement, then the change
in the particle’s speed can be easily evaluated.
Figure 7.13 shows a particle of mass m moving to the right under the action of
a constant net force ⌺F. Because the force is constant, we know from Newton’s second law that the particle moves with a constant acceleration a. If the particle is displaced a distance d, the net work done by the total force ⌺F is

on it equals the change in kinetic energy of the particle.
In general, the kinetic energy K of a particle of mass m moving with a speed v

Kinetic Energy and the Work — Kinetic Energy Theorem

Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and has the same units as work. For example, a 2.0-kg object moving with a speed of 4.0 m/s has a kinetic energy of 16 J.
Table 7.1 lists the kinetic energies for various objects.
It is often convenient to write Equation 7.13 in the form

⌺ W ⫽ Kf ⫺ Ki ⫽ ⌬K

(7.15)

Work – kinetic energy theorem

That is, Ki ⫹ ⌺W ⫽ Kf .
Equation 7.15 is an important result known as the work – kinetic energy theorem. It is important to note that when we use this theorem, we must include all
of the forces that do work on the particle in the calculation of the net work done.
From this theorem, we see that the speed of a particle increases if the net work
done on it is positive because the ﬁnal kinetic energy is greater than the initial kinetic energy. The particle’s speed decreases if the net work done is negative because the ﬁnal kinetic energy is less than the initial kinetic energy.
The work – kinetic energy theorem as expressed by Equation 7.15 allows us to
think of kinetic energy as the work a particle can do in coming to rest, or the
amount of energy stored in the particle. For example, suppose a hammer (our
particle) is on the verge of striking a nail, as shown in Figure 7.14. The moving
hammer has kinetic energy and so can do work on the nail. The work done on the
nail is equal to Fd, where F is the average force exerted on the nail by the hammer
and d is the distance the nail is driven into the wall.4
We derived the work – kinetic energy theorem under the assumption of a constant net force, but it also is valid when the force varies. To see this, suppose the
net force acting on a particle in the x direction is ⌺Fx . We can apply Newton’s second law, ⌺Fx ⫽ max , and use Equation 7.8 to express the net work done as

⌺W ⫽

 ⌺



Fx dx ⫽



max dx

If the resultant force varies with x, the acceleration and speed also depend on x.
Because we normally consider acceleration as a function of t, we now use the following chain rule to express a in a slightly different way:
a⫽

dv
dv dx
dv
⫽
⫽v

dx dt
dx

Figure 7.14 The moving hammer has kinetic energy and thus
can do work on the nail, driving it
into the wall.

Substituting this expression for a into the above equation for ⌺W gives

⌺W ⫽

⌺ W ⫽ 12 mv f 2 ⫺ 12 mv i2

(7.16)

The limits of the integration were changed from x values to v values because the
variable was changed from x to v. Thus, we conclude that the net work done on a
particle by the net force acting on it is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of
the particle. This is true whether or not the net force is constant.
4

Note that because the nail and the hammer are systems of particles rather than single particles, part of
the hammer’s kinetic energy goes into warming the hammer and the nail upon impact. Also, as the nail
moves into the wall in response to the impact, the large frictional force between the nail and the wood
results in the continuous transformation of the kinetic energy of the nail into further temperature increases in the nail and the wood, as well as in deformation of the wall. Energy associated with temperature changes is called internal energy and will be studied in detail in Chapter 20.

The net work done on a particle
equals the change in its kinetic
energy

CHAPTER 7

Work and Kinetic Energy

Situations Involving Kinetic Friction
One way to include frictional forces in analyzing the motion of an object sliding
on a horizontal surface is to describe the kinetic energy lost because of friction.
Suppose a book moving on a horizontal surface is given an initial horizontal velocity vi and slides a distance d before reaching a ﬁnal velocity vf as shown in Figure
7.15. The external force that causes the book to undergo an acceleration in the
negative x direction is the force of kinetic friction fk acting to the left, opposite the
motion. The initial kinetic energy of the book is 12 mvi2, and its ﬁnal kinetic energy
is 12 mvf 2 . Applying Newton’s second law to the book can show this. Because the
only force acting on the book in the x direction is the friction force, Newton’s second law gives ⫺ fk ⫽ max . Multiplying both sides of this expression by d and using
Equation 2.12 in the form vxf 2 ⫺ vxi2 ⫽ 2ax d for motion under constant acceleration give ⫺ fkd ⫽ (max)d ⫽ 12 mvxf 2 ⫺ 12 mvxi2 or

Figure 7.15 A book sliding to
the right on a horizontal surface
slows down in the presence of a
force of kinetic friction acting to
the left. The initial velocity of the
book is vi , and its ﬁnal velocity is
vf . The normal force and the force
of gravity are not included in the
diagram because they are perpendicular to the direction of motion
and therefore do not inﬂuence the
book’s velocity.

EXAMPLE 7.7

(7.17a)

This result speciﬁes that the amount by which the force of kinetic friction changes
the kinetic energy of the book is equal to ⫺ fk d. Part of this lost kinetic energy goes
into warming up the book, and the rest goes into warming up the surface over
which the book slides. In effect, the quantity ⫺ fk d is equal to the work done by kinetic friction on the book plus the work done by kinetic friction on the surface.
(We shall study the relationship between temperature and energy in Part III of this
text.) When friction — as well as other forces — acts on an object, the work – kinetic
energy theorem reads

Here, ⌺Wother represents the sum of the amounts of work done on the object by
forces other than kinetic friction.

its speed was 3.5 m/s.

Does the Ramp Lessen the Work Required?

A man wishes to load a refrigerator onto a truck using a
ramp, as shown in Figure 7.17. He claims that less work would
be required to load the truck if the length L of the ramp were
increased. Is his statement valid?

Solution No. Although less force is required with a longer
ramp, that force must act over a greater distance if the same
amount of work is to be done. Suppose the refrigerator is
wheeled on a dolly up the ramp at constant speed. The

not change the total amount of work that must be done by the salmon as they leap

that work in a series of smaller jumps, and the net effect is to raise the vertical position of the ﬁsh by the height of the dam.

Useful Physics for Safer Driving

A certain car traveling at an initial speed v slides a distance d
to a halt after its brakes lock. Assuming that the car’s initial
speed is instead 2v at the moment the brakes lock, estimate
the distance it slides.

Solution Let us assume that the force of kinetic friction
between the car and the road surface is constant and the

same for both speeds. The net force multiplied by the displacement of the car is equal to the initial kinetic energy of
the car (because Kf ⫽ 0). If the speed is doubled, as it is in
this example, the kinetic energy is quadrupled. For a given
constant applied force (in this case, the frictional force), the
distance traveled is four times as great when the initial speed is
doubled, and so the estimated distance that the car slides is 4d.

A block of mass 1.6 kg is attached to a horizontal spring that
has a force constant of 1.0 ⫻ 103 N/m, as shown in Figure
7.10. The spring is compressed 2.0 cm and is then released
from rest. (a) Calculate the speed of the block as it passes
through the equilibrium position x ⫽ 0 if the surface is frictionless.
In this situation, the block starts with vi ⫽ 0 at

Solution

Solution Certainly, the answer has to be less than what we
found in part (a) because the frictional force retards the motion. We use Equation 7.17 to calculate the kinetic energy lost
because of friction and add this negative value to the kinetic
energy found in the absence of friction. The kinetic energy
lost due to friction is

POWER

Imagine two identical models of an automobile: one with a base-priced four-cylinder engine; and the other with the highest-priced optional engine, a mighty eightcylinder powerplant. Despite the differences in engines, the two cars have the
same mass. Both cars climb a roadway up a hill, but the car with the optional engine takes much less time to reach the top. Both cars have done the same amount
of work against gravity, but in different time periods. From a practical viewpoint, it
is interesting to know not only the work done by the vehicles but also the rate at
which it is done. In taking the ratio of the amount of work done to the time taken
to do it, we have a way of quantifying this concept. The time rate of doing work is
called power.
If an external force is applied to an object (which we assume acts as a particle), and if the work done by this force in the time interval ⌬t is W, then the average power expended during this interval is deﬁned as


W

The work done on the object contributes to the increase in the energy of the object. Therefore, a more general deﬁnition of power is the time rate of energy transfer.

Power Delivered by an Elevator Motor

An elevator car has a mass of 1 000 kg and is carrying passengers having a combined mass of 800 kg. A constant frictional
force of 4 000 N retards its motion upward, as shown in Figure 7.18a. (a) What must be the minimum power delivered
by the motor to lift the elevator car at a constant speed of

Solution The motor must supply the force of magnitude
T that pulls the elevator car upward. Reading that the speed
is constant provides the hint that a ⫽ 0, and therefore we
know from Newton’s second law that ⌺Fy ⫽ 0. We have drawn

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 7.13
In part (a) of the preceding example, the motor delivers
power to lift the car, and yet the car moves at constant speed.
A student analyzing this situation notes that the kinetic energy of the car does not change because its speed does not
change. This student then reasons that, according to the
work – kinetic energy theorem, W ⫽ ⌬K ⫽ 0. Knowing that

the motor also must be zero. How would you explain this apparent paradox?

Solution The work – kinetic energy theorem tells us that
the net force acting on the system multiplied by the displacement is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the system. In our elevator case, the net force is indeed zero (that is,
T ⫺ Mg ⫺ f ⫽ 0), and so W ⫽ (⌺F y)d ⫽ 0. However, the
power from the motor is calculated not from the net force but
rather from the force exerted by the motor acting in the direction of motion, which in this case is T and not zero.

ENERGY AND THE AUTOMOBILE

Automobiles powered by gasoline engines are very inefﬁcient machines. Even under ideal conditions, less than 15% of the chemical energy in the fuel is used to
power the vehicle. The situation is much worse under stop-and-go driving conditions in a city. In this section, we use the concepts of energy, power, and friction to
analyze automobile fuel consumption.

202

CHAPTER 7

Work and Kinetic Energy

Many mechanisms contribute to energy loss in an automobile. About 67% of
the energy available from the fuel is lost in the engine. This energy ends up in the
atmosphere, partly via the exhaust system and partly via the cooling system. (As we
shall see in Chapter 22, the great energy loss from the exhaust and cooling systems
is required by a fundamental law of thermodynamics.) Approximately 10% of the
available energy is lost to friction in the transmission, drive shaft, wheel and axle
bearings, and differential. Friction in other moving parts dissipates approximately
6% of the energy, and 4% of the energy is used to operate fuel and oil pumps and
such accessories as power steering and air conditioning. This leaves a mere 13% of
the available energy to propel the automobile! This energy is used mainly to balance the energy loss due to ﬂexing of the tires and the friction caused by the air,
which is more commonly referred to as air resistance.
Let us examine the power required to provide a force in the forward direction
that balances the combination of the two frictional forces. The coefﬁcient of
rolling friction ␮ between the tires and the road is about 0.016. For a 1 450-kg car,
the weight is 14 200 N and the force of rolling friction has a magnitude of ␮n ⫽
␮mg ⫽ 227 N. As the speed of the car increases, a small reduction in the normal
force occurs as a result of a decrease in atmospheric pressure as air ﬂows over the
top of the car. (This phenomenon is discussed in Chapter 15.) This reduction in
the normal force causes a slight reduction in the force of rolling friction fr with increasing speed, as the data in Table 7.2 indicate.
Now let us consider the effect of the resistive force that results from the movement of air past the car. For large objects, the resistive force fa associated with air
friction is proportional to the square of the speed (in meters per second; see Section 6.4) and is given by Equation 6.6:
fa ⫽ 12 D␳Av2
where D is the drag coefﬁcient, ␳ is the density of air, and A is the cross-sectional
area of the moving object. We can use this expression to calculate the fa values in
Table 7.2, using D ⫽ 0.50, ␳ ⫽ 1.293 kg/m3, and A  2 m2.
The magnitude of the total frictional force ft is the sum of the rolling frictional
force and the air resistive force:
ft ⫽ fr ⫹ fa
At low speeds, road friction is the predominant resistive force, but at high
speeds air drag predominates, as shown in Table 7.2. Road friction can be decreased by a reduction in tire ﬂexing (for example, by an increase in the air pres-

can be reduced through the use of a smaller cross-sectional area and by streamlining the car. Although driving a car with the windows open increases air drag and
thus results in a 3% decrease in mileage, driving with the windows closed and the
air conditioner running results in a 12% decrease in mileage.

EXAMPLE 7.14

Gas Consumed by a Compact Car

A compact car has a mass of 800 kg, and its efﬁciency is rated
at 18%. (That is, 18% of the available fuel energy is delivered
to the wheels.) Find the amount of gasoline used to accelerate the car from rest to 27 m/s (60 mi/h). Use the fact that
the energy equivalent of 1 gal of gasoline is 1.3 ⫻ 108 J.

Solution The energy required to accelerate the car from
rest to a speed v is its ﬁnal kinetic energy 12 mv 2:
K ⫽ 12 mv 2 ⫽ 12 (800 kg)(27 m/s)2 ⫽ 2.9 ⫻ 105 J

would supply 1.3 ⫻ 108 J of energy. Because the engine is
only 18% efﬁcient, each gallon delivers only (0.18)(1.3 ⫻
108 J) ⫽ 2.3 ⫻ 107 J. Hence, the number of gallons used to
accelerate the car is
Number of gallons ⫽

2.9 ⫻ 105 J
⫽ 0.013 gal
2.3 ⫻ 107 J/gal

At cruising speed, this much gasoline is sufﬁcient to propel
the car nearly 0.5 mi. This demonstrates the extreme energy
requirements of stop-and-start driving.

If the engine were 100% efﬁcient, each gallon of gasoline

EXAMPLE 7.15

Power Delivered to Wheels

Suppose the compact car in Example 7.14 gets 35 mi/gal at
60 mi/h. How much power is delivered to the wheels?

Solution By simply canceling units, we determine that the
car consumes 60 mi/h ⫼ 35 mi/gal ⫽ 1.7 gal/h. Using the
fact that each gallon is equivalent to 1.3 ⫻ 108 J, we ﬁnd that
the total power used is
⫽

(1.7 gal/h)(1.3 ⫻ 108 J/gal)
3.6 ⫻ 103 s/h

⫽

2.2 ⫻ 108 J
⫽ 62 kW
3.6 ⫻ 103 s

Because 18% of the available power is used to propel the car,
the power delivered to the wheels is (0.18)(62 kW) ⫽
11 kW.

This is 40% less than the 18.3-kW value obtained

for the 1 450-kg car discussed in the text. Vehicle mass is
clearly an important factor in power-loss mechanisms.

Solution

The forces on the car are shown in Figure 7.19,
in which F is the force of friction from the road that propels
the car; the remaining forces have their usual meaning. Applying Newton’s second law to the motion along the road surface, we ﬁnd that

mva ⫽ (1 450 kg)(27 m/s)(1.0 m/s2)

Therefore, the power required to move the car forward is

mvg sin ␪ ⫽ (1 450 kg)(27 m/s)(9.80 m/s2)(sin 10°)
⫽ 67 kW ⫽ 89 hp

 ⫽ Fv ⫽ mva ⫹ mvg sin ␪ ⫹ 218v ⫹ 0.70v 3
The term mva represents the power that the engine must deliver to accelerate the car. If the car moves at constant speed,
this term is zero and the total power requirement is reduced.
The term mvg sin ␪ is the power required to provide a force
to balance a component of the force of gravity as the car
moves up the incline. This term would be zero for motion on
a horizontal surface. The term 218v is the power required to
provide a force to balance road friction, and the term 0.70v 3
is the power needed to do work on the air.
If we take m ⫽ 1 450 kg, v ⫽ 27 m/s (⫽60 mi/h), a ⫽

218v ⫽ 218(27 m/s) ⫽ 5.9 kW ⫽ 7.9 hp
0.70v 3 ⫽ 0.70(27 m/s)3 ⫽ 14 kW ⫽ 19 hp
Hence, the total power required is 126 kW, or

168 hp.

Note that the power requirements for traveling at constant
speed on a horizontal surface are only 20 kW, or 27 hp (the
sum of the last two terms). Furthermore, if the mass were
halved (as in the case of a compact car), then the power required also is reduced by almost the same factor.

KINETIC ENERGY AT HIGH SPEEDS

The laws of Newtonian mechanics are valid only for describing the motion of particles moving at speeds that are small compared with the speed of light in a vacuum
c (⫽3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s). When speeds are comparable to c, the equations of Newtonian mechanics must be replaced by the more general equations predicted by the
theory of relativity. One consequence of the theory of relativity is that the kinetic
energy of a particle of mass m moving with a speed v is no longer given by
K ⫽ mv 2/2. Instead, one must use the relativistic form of the kinetic energy:

K ⫽ mc2

 √1 ⫺ 1(v/c)



⫺1

According to this expression, speeds greater than c are not allowed because, as
v approaches c, K approaches ⬁. This limitation is consistent with experimental ob-

Summary

servations on subatomic particles, which have shown that no particles travel at
speeds greater than c. (In other words, c is the ultimate speed.) From this relativistic point of view, the work – kinetic energy theorem says that v can only approach c
because it would take an inﬁnite amount of work to attain the speed v ⫽ c.
All formulas in the theory of relativity must reduce to those in Newtonian mechanics at low particle speeds. It is instructive to show that this is the case for the
kinetic energy relationship by analyzing Equation 7.19 when v is small compared
with c. In this case, we expect K to reduce to the Newtonian expression. We can
check this by using the binomial expansion (Appendix B.5) applied to the quantity [1 ⫺ (v/c)2]⫺1/2, with v/c V 1. If we let x ⫽ (v/c)2, the expansion gives

SUMMARY
The work done by a constant force F acting on a particle is deﬁned as the product
of the component of the force in the direction of the particle’s displacement and
the magnitude of the displacement. Given a force F that makes an angle ␪ with the
displacement vector d of a particle acted on by the force, you should be able to determine the work done by F using the equation
W  Fd cos ␪

(7.1)

The scalar product (dot product) of two vectors A and B is deﬁned by the relationship
AⴢB  AB cos ␪

(7.3)

where the result is a scalar quantity and ␪ is the angle between the two vectors. The
scalar product obeys the commutative and distributive laws.
If a varying force does work on a particle as the particle moves along the x axis
from xi to xf , you must use the expression
W



xf

xi

Fx dx

(7.7)

where Fx is the component of force in the x direction. If several forces are acting
on the particle, the net work done by all of the forces is the sum of the amounts of
work done by all of the forces.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
7.1 No. The force does no work on the object because the
force is pointed toward the center of the circle and is
therefore perpendicular to the motion.
7.2 (a) Assuming the person lifts with a force of magnitude
mg, the weight of the box, the work he does during the
vertical displacement is mgh because the force is in the
direction of the displacement. The work he does during
the horizontal displacement is zero because now the
force he exerts on the box is perpendicular to the displacement. The net work he does is mgh ⫹ 0 ⫽ mgh.
(b) The work done by the gravitational force on the box
as the box is displaced vertically is ⫺ mgh because the direction of this force is opposite the direction of the displacement. The work done by the gravitational force is
zero during the horizontal displacement because now
the direction of this force is perpendicular to the direction of the displacement. The net work done by the
gravitational force ⫺ mgh ⫹ 0 ⫽ ⫺ mgh. The total work
done on the box is ⫹ mgh ⫺ mgh ⫽ 0.
7.3 No. For example, consider the two vectors A ⫽ 3i ⫺ 2j
and B ⫽ 2i ⫺ j. Their dot product is A ⴢ B ⫽ 8, yet both
vectors have negative y components.

7.4 Force divided by displacement, which in SI units is newtons per meter (N/m).
7.5 Yes, whenever the frictional force has a component along
the direction of motion. Consider a crate sitting on the
bed of a truck as the truck accelerates to the east. The
static friction force exerted on the crate by the truck acts
to the east to give the crate the same acceleration as the
truck (assuming that the crate does not slip). Because
the crate accelerates, its kinetic energy must increase.
7.6 Because the two vehicles perform the same amount of
work, the areas under the two graphs are equal. However, the graph for the low-power truck extends over a
longer time interval and does not extend as high on the
 axis as the graph for the sports car does.

Potential Energy

I

n Chapter 7 we introduced the concept of kinetic energy, which is the energy
associated with the motion of an object. In this chapter we introduce another
form of energy — potential energy, which is the energy associated with the arrangement of a system of objects that exert forces on each other. Potential energy can
be thought of as stored energy that can either do work or be converted to kinetic
energy.
The potential energy concept can be used only when dealing with a special
class of forces called conservative forces. When only conservative forces act within an
isolated system, the kinetic energy gained (or lost) by the system as its members
change their relative positions is balanced by an equal loss (or gain) in potential
energy. This balancing of the two forms of energy is known as the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.
Energy is present in the Universe in various forms, including mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, and nuclear. Furthermore, one form of energy can be converted to another. For example, when an electric motor is connected to a battery,
the chemical energy in the battery is converted to electrical energy in the motor,
which in turn is converted to mechanical energy as the motor turns some device.
The transformation of energy from one form to another is an essential part of the
study of physics, engineering, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy.
When energy is changed from one form to another, the total amount present
does not change. Conservation of energy means that although the form of energy
may change, if an object (or system) loses energy, that same amount of energy appears in another object or in the object’s surroundings.

POTENTIAL ENERGY

An object that possesses kinetic energy can do work on another object — for example, a moving hammer driving a nail into a wall. Now we shall introduce another
form of energy. This energy, called potential energy U, is the energy associated
with a system of objects.
Before we describe speciﬁc forms of potential energy, we must ﬁrst deﬁne a
system, which consists of two or more objects that exert forces on one another. If
the arrangement of the system changes, then the potential energy of the
system changes. If the system consists of only two particle-like objects that exert
forces on each other, then the work done by the force acting on one of the objects
causes a transformation of energy between the object’s kinetic energy and other
forms of the system’s energy.

Gravitational Potential Energy
As an object falls toward the Earth, the Earth exerts a gravitational force mg on the
object, with the direction of the force being the same as the direction of the object’s motion. The gravitational force does work on the object and thereby increases the object’s kinetic energy. Imagine that a brick is dropped from rest directly above a nail in a board lying on the ground. When the brick is released, it
falls toward the ground, gaining speed and therefore gaining kinetic energy. The
brick – Earth system has potential energy when the brick is at any distance above
the ground (that is, it has the potential to do work), and this potential energy is
converted to kinetic energy as the brick falls. The conversion from potential energy to kinetic energy occurs continuously over the entire fall. When the brick
reaches the nail and the board lying on the ground, it does work on the nail,

CHAPTER 8

driving it into the board. What determines how much work the brick is able to do
on the nail? It is easy to see that the heavier the brick, the farther in it drives the
nail; also the higher the brick is before it is released, the more work it does when it
strikes the nail.
The product of the magnitude of the gravitational force mg acting on an object and the height y of the object is so important in physics that we give it a name:
the gravitational potential energy. The symbol for gravitational potential energy
is Ug , and so the deﬁning equation for gravitational potential energy is
Ug ⬅ mgy

Gravitational potential energy is the potential energy of the object – Earth system.
This potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the system by the gravitational force. In this type of system, in which one of the members (the Earth) is
much more massive than the other (the object), the massive object can be modeled as stationary, and the kinetic energy of the system can be represented entirely
by the kinetic energy of the lighter object. Thus, the kinetic energy of the system is
represented by that of the object falling toward the Earth. Also note that Equation
8.1 is valid only for objects near the surface of the Earth, where g is approximately
constant.1
Let us now directly relate the work done on an object by the gravitational
force to the gravitational potential energy of the object – Earth system. To do this,
let us consider a brick of mass m at an initial height yi above the ground, as shown
in Figure 8.1. If we neglect air resistance, then the only force that does work on
the brick as it falls is the gravitational force exerted on the brick mg. The work Wg
done by the gravitational force as the brick undergoes a downward displacement
d is

yf

Figure 8.1 The work done on
the brick by the gravitational force
as the brick falls from a height yi to
a height yf is equal to mgy i ⫺ mgy f .

(8.1)

Wg ⫽ (mg) ⴢ d ⫽ (⫺mg j) ⴢ (yf ⫺ yi) j ⫽ mgyi ⫺ mgyf
where we have used the fact that j ⴢ j ⫽ 1 (Eq. 7.4). If an object undergoes
both a horizontal and a vertical displacement, so that d ⫽ (xf ⫺ xi)i ⫹ (yf ⫺ yi)j,
then the work done by the gravitational force is still mgyi ⫺ mgyf because
⫺mg j ⴢ (xf ⫺ xi)i ⫽ 0. Thus, the work done by the gravitational force depends only
on the change in y and not on any change in the horizontal position x.
We just learned that the quantity mgy is the gravitational potential energy of
the system Ug , and so we have
Wg ⫽ Ui ⫺ Uf ⫽ ⫺(Uf ⫺ Ui) ⫽ ⫺⌬Ug

(8.2)

From this result, we see that the work done on any object by the gravitational force
is equal to the negative of the change in the system’s gravitational potential energy.
Also, this result demonstrates that it is only the difference in the gravitational potential energy at the initial and ﬁnal locations that matters. This means that we are
free to place the origin of coordinates in any convenient location. Finally, the work
done by the gravitational force on an object as the object falls to the Earth is the
same as the work done were the object to start at the same point and slide down an
incline to the Earth. Horizontal motion does not affect the value of Wg .
The unit of gravitational potential energy is the same as that of work — the
joule. Potential energy, like work and kinetic energy, is a scalar quantity.

The assumption that the force of gravity is constant is a good one as long as the vertical displacement
is small compared with the Earth’s radius.

EXAMPLE 8.1

The Bowler and the Sore Toe

A bowling ball held by a careless bowler slips from the
bowler’s hands and drops on the bowler’s toe. Choosing ﬂoor
level as the y ⫽ 0 point of your coordinate system, estimate
the total work done on the ball by the force of gravity as the
ball falls. Repeat the calculation, using the top of the bowler’s
head as the origin of coordinates.

Solution First, we need to estimate a few values. A bowling
ball has a mass of approximately 7 kg, and the top of a person’s toe is about 0.03 m above the ﬂoor. Also, we shall assume the ball falls from a height of 0.5 m. Holding nonsignificant digits until we ﬁnish the problem, we calculate the
gravitational potential energy of the ball – Earth system just
before the ball is released to be Ui ⫽ mg yi ⫽ (7 kg)
(9.80 m/s2)(0.5 m) ⫽ 34.3 J. A similar calculation for when

the ball reaches his toe gives Uf ⫽ mg yf ⫽ (7 kg)
(9.80 m/s2)(0.03 m) ⫽ 2.06 J. So, the work done by the gravitational force is Wg ⫽ Ui ⫺ Uf ⫽ 32.24 J. We should probably
keep only one digit because of the roughness of our estimates; thus, we estimate that the gravitational force does 30 J
of work on the bowling ball as it falls. The system had 30 J of
gravitational potential energy relative to the top of the toe before the ball began its fall.
When we use the bowler’s head (which we estimate to be
1.50 m above the ﬂoor) as our origin of coordinates, we ﬁnd
that Ui ⫽ mg yi ⫽ (7 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(⫺ 1 m) ⫽ ⫺ 68.6 J and
that Uf ⫽ mg yf ⫽ (7 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(⫺ 1.47 m) ⫽ ⫺ 100.8 J.
The work being done by the gravitational force is still
Wg ⫽ Ui ⫺ Uf ⫽ 32.24 J ⬇

30 J.

Elastic Potential Energy
Now consider a system consisting of a block plus a spring, as shown in Figure 8.2.
The force that the spring exerts on the block is given by Fs ⫽ ⫺kx. In the previous
chapter, we learned that the work done by the spring force on a block connected
to the spring is given by Equation 7.11:
Ws ⫽ 12kxi2 ⫺ 12kxf 2

(8.3)

In this situation, the initial and ﬁnal x coordinates of the block are measured from
its equilibrium position, x ⫽ 0. Again we see that Ws depends only on the initial
and ﬁnal x coordinates of the object and is zero for any closed path. The elastic
potential energy function associated with the system is deﬁned by
Us ⬅ 12kx2

(8.4)

The elastic potential energy of the system can be thought of as the energy stored
in the deformed spring (one that is either compressed or stretched from its equilibrium position). To visualize this, consider Figure 8.2, which shows a spring on a
frictionless, horizontal surface. When a block is pushed against the spring (Fig.
8.2b) and the spring is compressed a distance x, the elastic potential energy stored
in the spring is kx 2/2. When the block is released from rest, the spring snaps back
to its original length and the stored elastic potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the block (Fig. 8.2c). The elastic potential energy stored in the
spring is zero whenever the spring is undeformed (x ⫽ 0). Energy is stored in the
spring only when the spring is either stretched or compressed. Furthermore, the
elastic potential energy is a maximum when the spring has reached its maximum
compression or extension (that is, when 兩 x 兩 is a maximum). Finally, because the
elastic potential energy is proportional to x 2, we see that Us is always positive in a
deformed spring.

CONSERVATIVE AND NONCONSERVATIVE FORCES

The work done by the gravitational force does not depend on whether an object
falls vertically or slides down a sloping incline. All that matters is the change in the
object’s elevation. On the other hand, the energy loss due to friction on that incline depends on the distance the object slides. In other words, the path makes no
difference when we consider the work done by the gravitational force, but it does
make a difference when we consider the energy loss due to frictional forces. We
can use this varying dependence on path to classify forces as either conservative or
nonconservative.
Of the two forces just mentioned, the gravitational force is conservative and
the frictional force is nonconservative.

Conservative Forces
Properties of a conservative force

Conservative forces have two important properties:
1. A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between any two
points is independent of the path taken by the particle.
2. The work done by a conservative force on a particle moving through any closed
path is zero. (A closed path is one in which the beginning and end points are
identical.)
The gravitational force is one example of a conservative force, and the force
that a spring exerts on any object attached to the spring is another. As we learned
in the preceding section, the work done by the gravitational force on an object
moving between any two points near the Earth’s surface is Wg ⫽ mg yi ⫺ mg yf .
From this equation we see that Wg depends only on the initial and ﬁnal y coordi-

8.3

219

Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

nates of the object and hence is independent of the path. Furthermore, Wg is zero
when the object moves over any closed path (where yi ⫽ yf ).
For the case of the object – spring system, the work Ws done by the spring force
is given by Ws ⫽ 12kxi2 ⫺ 12kxf 2 (Eq. 8.3). Again, we see that the spring force is conservative because Ws depends only on the initial and ﬁnal x coordinates of the object and is zero for any closed path.
We can associate a potential energy with any conservative force and can do this
only for conservative forces. In the previous section, the potential energy associated
with the gravitational force was deﬁned as Ug ⬅ mgy. In general, the work Wc done
on an object by a conservative force is equal to the initial value of the potential energy associated with the object minus the ﬁnal value:
Wc ⫽ Ui ⫺ Uf ⫽ ⫺⌬U

(8.5)

Work done by a conservative force

This equation should look familiar to you. It is the general form of the equation
for work done by the gravitational force (Eq. 8.2) and that for the work done by
the spring force (Eq. 8.3).

Nonconservative Forces
5.3

A force is nonconservative if it causes a change in mechanical energy E,
which we deﬁne as the sum of kinetic and potential energies. For example, if a
book is sent sliding on a horizontal surface that is not frictionless, the force of kinetic friction reduces the book’s kinetic energy. As the book slows down, its kinetic
energy decreases. As a result of the frictional force, the temperatures of the book
and surface increase. The type of energy associated with temperature is internal energy, which we will study in detail in Chapter 20. Experience tells us that this internal energy cannot be transferred back to the kinetic energy of the book. In other
words, the energy transformation is not reversible. Because the force of kinetic
friction changes the mechanical energy of a system, it is a nonconservative force.
From the work – kinetic energy theorem, we see that the work done by a conservative force on an object causes a change in the kinetic energy of the object.
The change in kinetic energy depends only on the initial and ﬁnal positions of the
object, and not on the path connecting these points. Let us compare this to the
sliding book example, in which the nonconservative force of friction is acting between the book and the surface. According to Equation 7.17a, the change in kinetic energy of the book due to friction is ⌬K friction ⫽ ⫺fkd , where d is the length
of the path over which the friction force acts. Imagine that the book slides from A
to B over the straight-line path of length d in Figure 8.3. The change in kinetic energy is ⫺fkd . Now, suppose the book slides over the semicircular path from A to B.
In this case, the path is longer and, as a result, the change in kinetic energy is
greater in magnitude than that in the straight-line case. For this particular path,
the change in kinetic energy is ⫺fk␲ d/2 , since d is the diameter of the semicircle.
Thus, we see that for a nonconservative force, the change in kinetic energy depends on the path followed between the initial and ﬁnal points. If a potential energy is involved, then the change in the total mechanical energy depends on the
path followed. We shall return to this point in Section 8.5.

8.3

CONSERVATIVE FORCES AND POTENTIAL ENERGY

In the preceding section we found that the work done on a particle by a conservative force does not depend on the path taken by the particle. The work depends
only on the particle’s initial and ﬁnal coordinates. As a consequence, we can de-

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

ﬁne a potential energy function U such that the work done by a conservative
force equals the decrease in the potential energy of the system. The work done by
a conservative force F as a particle moves along the x axis is2

xi

Fx dx ⫽ ⫺⌬U

(8.6)

where Fx is the component of F in the direction of the displacement. That is, the
work done by a conservative force equals the negative of the change in the
potential energy associated with that force, where the change in the potential
energy is deﬁned as ⌬U ⫽ Uf ⫺ Ui .
We can also express Equation 8.6 as
⌬U ⫽ Uf ⫺ Ui ⫽ ⫺

冕

xi

Fx dx

(8.7)

Therefore, ⌬U is negative when Fx and dx are in the same direction, as when an object is lowered in a gravitational ﬁeld or when a spring pushes an object toward
equilibrium.
The term potential energy implies that the object has the potential, or capability,
of either gaining kinetic energy or doing work when it is released from some point
under the inﬂuence of a conservative force exerted on the object by some other
member of the system. It is often convenient to establish some particular location
xi as a reference point and measure all potential energy differences with respect to
it. We can then deﬁne the potential energy function as
Uf (x) ⫽ ⫺

冕

xf

xi

Fx dx ⫹ Ui

(8.8)

The value of Ui is often taken to be zero at the reference point. It really does
not matter what value we assign to Ui , because any nonzero value merely shifts
Uf (x) by a constant amount, and only the change in potential energy is physically
meaningful.
If the conservative force is known as a function of position, we can use Equation 8.8 to calculate the change in potential energy of a system as an object within
the system moves from xi to xf . It is interesting to note that in the case of onedimensional displacement, a force is always conservative if it is a function of position only. This is not necessarily the case for motion involving two- or three-dimensional displacements.

CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL ENERGY

An object held at some height h above the ﬂoor has no kinetic energy. However, as
we learned earlier, the gravitational potential energy of the object – Earth system is
equal to mgh. If the object is dropped, it falls to the ﬂoor; as it falls, its speed and
thus its kinetic energy increase, while the potential energy of the system decreases.
If factors such as air resistance are ignored, whatever potential energy the system
loses as the object moves downward appears as kinetic energy of the object. In
other words, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies — the total mechanical
energy E — remains constant. This is an example of the principle of conservation

of mechanical energy. For the case of an object in free fall, this principle tells us
that any increase (or decrease) in potential energy is accompanied by an equal decrease (or increase) in kinetic energy. Note that the total mechanical energy of
a system remains constant in any isolated system of objects that interact
only through conservative forces.
Because the total mechanical energy E of a system is deﬁned as the sum of the
kinetic and potential energies, we can write

Total mechanical energy

We can state the principle of conservation of energy as Ei ⫽ Ef , and so we have
Ki ⫹ Ui ⫽ Kf ⫹ Uf

(8.10)

It is important to note that Equation 8.10 is valid only when no energy is
added to or removed from the system. Furthermore, there must be no nonconservative forces doing work within the system.
Consider the carnival Ring-the-Bell event illustrated at the beginning of the
chapter. The participant is trying to convert the initial kinetic energy of the hammer into gravitational potential energy associated with a weight that slides on a
vertical track. If the hammer has sufﬁcient kinetic energy, the weight is lifted high
enough to reach the bell at the top of the track. To maximize the hammer’s kinetic energy, the player must swing the heavy hammer as rapidly as possible. The
fast-moving hammer does work on the pivoted target, which in turn does work on
the weight. Of course, greasing the track (so as to minimize energy loss due to friction) would also help but is probably not allowed!
If more than one conservative force acts on an object within a system, a potential energy function is associated with each force. In such a case, we can apply the
principle of conservation of mechanical energy for the system as
Ki ⫹ ⌺ Ui ⫽ Kf ⫹ ⌺ Uf

(8.11)

where the number of terms in the sums equals the number of conservative forces
present. For example, if an object connected to a spring oscillates vertically, two
conservative forces act on the object: the spring force and the gravitational force.

A ball of mass m is dropped from a height h above the
ground, as shown in Figure 8.6. (a) Neglecting air resistance,
determine the speed of the ball when it is at a height y above
the ground.

Solution Because the ball is in free fall, the only force acting on it is the gravitational force. Therefore, we apply the
principle of conservation of mechanical energy to the
ball – Earth system. Initially, the system has potential energy
but no kinetic energy. As the ball falls, the total mechanical
energy remains constant and equal to the initial potential energy of the system.
At the instant the ball is released, its kinetic energy is
Ki ⫽ 0 and the potential energy of the system is Ui ⫽ mgh.
When the ball is at a distance y above the ground, its kinetic
energy is Kf ⫽ 12mvf 2 and the potential energy relative to the
ground is Uf ⫽ mgy. Applying Equation 8.10, we obtain

only on the magnitude of the velocity; and (2) the change in
the gravitational potential energy depends only on the
change in position in the vertical direction.

The Pendulum

A pendulum consists of a sphere of mass m attached to a light
cord of length L, as shown in Figure 8.7. The sphere is released from rest when the cord makes an angle ␪A with the
vertical, and the pivot at P is frictionless. (a) Find the speed
of the sphere when it is at the lowest point 훾.

If we measure the y coordinates of the sphere from the
center of rotation, then yA ⫽ ⫺L cos ␪A and yB ⫽ ⫺L. Therefore, UA ⫽ ⫺mgL cos ␪A and UB ⫽ ⫺mgL. Applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to the system gives

Solution The only force that does work on the sphere is
the gravitational force. (The force of tension is always perpendicular to each element of the displacement and hence does
no work.) Because the gravitational force is conservative, the
total mechanical energy of the pendulum – Earth system is
constant. (In other words, we can classify this as an “energy
conservation” problem.) As the pendulum swings, continuous
transformation between potential and kinetic energy occurs.
At the instant the pendulum is released, the energy of the system is entirely potential energy. At point 훾 the pendulum has
kinetic energy, but the system has lost some potential energy.
At 훿 the system has regained its initial potential energy, and
the kinetic energy of the pendulum is again zero.

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

WORK DONE BY NONCONSERVATIVE FORCES

As we have seen, if the forces acting on objects within a system are conservative,
then the mechanical energy of the system remains constant. However, if some of
the forces acting on objects within the system are not conservative, then the mechanical energy of the system does not remain constant. Let us examine two types
of nonconservative forces: an applied force and the force of kinetic friction.

Work Done by an Applied Force
When you lift a book through some distance by applying a force to it, the force
you apply does work Wapp on the book, while the gravitational force does work Wg
on the book. If we treat the book as a particle, then the net work done on the
book is related to the change in its kinetic energy as described by the work –
kinetic energy theorem given by Equation 7.15:
Wapp ⫹ Wg ⫽ ⌬K

(8.12)

Because the gravitational force is conservative, we can use Equation 8.2 to express
the work done by the gravitational force in terms of the change in potential energy, or Wg ⫽ ⫺⌬U. Substituting this into Equation 8.12 gives
Wapp ⫽ ⌬K ⫹ ⌬U

(8.13)

Note that the right side of this equation represents the change in the mechanical
energy of the book – Earth system. This result indicates that your applied force
transfers energy to the system in the form of kinetic energy of the book and gravitational potential energy of the book – Earth system. Thus, we conclude that if an
object is part of a system, then an applied force can transfer energy into or out
of the system.

Situations Involving Kinetic Friction

QuickLab
Find a friend and play a game of
racquetball. After a long volley, feel
the ball and note that it is warm. Why
is that?

Kinetic friction is an example of a nonconservative force. If a book is given some
initial velocity on a horizontal surface that is not frictionless, then the force of kinetic friction acting on the book opposes its motion and the book slows down and
eventually stops. The force of kinetic friction reduces the kinetic energy of the
book by transforming kinetic energy to internal energy of the book and part of the
horizontal surface. Only part of the book’s kinetic energy is transformed to internal energy in the book. The rest appears as internal energy in the surface. (When
you trip and fall while running across a gymnasium ﬂoor, not only does the skin on
your knees warm up but so does the ﬂoor!)
As the book moves through a distance d, the only force that does work is the
force of kinetic friction. This force causes a decrease in the kinetic energy of the
book. This decrease was calculated in Chapter 7, leading to Equation 7.17a, which
we repeat here:
⌬Kfriction ⫽ ⫺fkd
(8.14)
If the book moves on an incline that is not frictionless, a change in the gravitational potential energy of the book – Earth system also occurs, and ⫺fkd is the
amount by which the mechanical energy of the system changes because of the
force of kinetic friction. In such cases,

Problem-Solving Hints
Conservation of Energy
We can solve many problems in physics using the principle of conservation of
energy. You should incorporate the following procedure when you apply this
principle:
• Deﬁne your system, which may include two or more interacting particles, as
well as springs or other systems in which elastic potential energy can be
stored. Choose the initial and ﬁnal points.
• Identify zero points for potential energy (both gravitational and spring). If
there is more than one conservative force, write an expression for the potential energy associated with each force.
• Determine whether any nonconservative forces are present. Remember that
if friction or air resistance is present, mechanical energy is not conserved.
• If mechanical energy is conserved, you can write the total initial energy
E i ⫽ K i ⫹ U i at some point. Then, write an expression for the total ﬁnal energy E f ⫽ K f ⫹ U f at the ﬁnal point that is of interest. Because mechanical
energy is conserved, you can equate the two total energies and solve for the
quantity that is unknown.
• If frictional forces are present (and thus mechanical energy is not conserved),
ﬁrst write expressions for the total initial and total ﬁnal energies. In this
case, the difference between the total ﬁnal mechanical energy and the total
initial mechanical energy equals the change in mechanical energy in the system due to friction.

EXAMPLE 8.4

Crate Sliding Down a Ramp

A 3.00-kg crate slides down a ramp. The ramp is 1.00 m in
length and inclined at an angle of 30.0°, as shown in Figure
8.8. The crate starts from rest at the top, experiences a constant frictional force of magnitude 5.00 N, and continues to
move a short distance on the ﬂat ﬂoor after it leaves the
ramp. Use energy methods to determine the speed of the
crate at the bottom of the ramp.

Solution Because vi ⫽ 0, the initial kinetic energy at the
top of the ramp is zero. If the y coordinate is measured from
the bottom of the ramp (the ﬁnal position where the potential energy is zero) with the upward direction being positive,
then yi ⫽ 0.500 m. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of
the crate – Earth system at the top is all potential energy:
Ei ⫽ Ki ⫹ Ui ⫽ 0 ⫹ Ui ⫽ mg yi

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

When the crate reaches the bottom of the ramp, the potential energy of the system is zero because the elevation of
the crate is yf ⫽ 0. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of
the system when the crate reaches the bottom is all kinetic
energy:
Ef ⫽ Kf ⫹ Uf ⫽ 12mvf 2 ⫹ 0
We cannot say that Ei ⫽ Ef because a nonconservative force
reduces the mechanical energy of the system: the force of kinetic friction acting on the crate. In this case, Equation 8.15
gives ⌬E ⫽ ⫺fk d, where d is the displacement along the
ramp. (Remember that the forces normal to the ramp do no
work on the crate because they are perpendicular to the displacement.) With fk ⫽ 5.00 N and d ⫽ 1.00 m, we have
⌬E ⫽ ⫺fkd ⫽ ⫺(5.00 N)(1.00 m) ⫽ ⫺5.00 J
This result indicates that the system loses some mechanical
energy because of the presence of the nonconservative frictional force. Applying Equation 8.15 gives

Motion on a Curved Track
Ki ⫹ Ui ⫽ Kf ⫹ Uf

A child of mass m rides on an irregularly curved slide of
height h ⫽ 2.00 m, as shown in Figure 8.9. The child starts
from rest at the top. (a) Determine his speed at the bottom,
assuming no friction is present.

Solution The normal force n does no work on the child
because this force is always perpendicular to each element of
the displacement. Because there is no friction, the mechanical energy of the child – Earth system is conserved. If we measure the y coordinate in the upward direction from the bottom of the slide, then yi ⫽ h, yf ⫽ 0, and we obtain

n

Note that the result is the same as it would be had the child

h ⫽ 2.00 m, giving
vf ⫽ √2gh ⫽ √2(9.80 m/s2)(2.00 m) ⫽

6.26 m/s

(b) If a force of kinetic friction acts on the child, how
much mechanical energy does the system lose? Assume that
vf ⫽ 3.00 m/s and m ⫽ 20.0 kg.

Solution In this case, mechanical energy is not conserved,
and so we must use Equation 8.15 to ﬁnd the loss of mechanical energy due to friction:
⌬E ⫽ Ef ⫺ Ei ⫽ (Kf ⫹ Uf ) ⫺ (Ki ⫹ Ui )
⫽ (12mvf 2 ⫹ 0) ⫺ (0 ⫹ mgh) ⫽ 12mvf 2 ⫺ mgh

⫽ 12(20.0 kg)(3.00 m/s)2 ⫺ (20.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(2.00 m)
⫽ ⫺302 J

Figure 8.9 If the slide is frictionless, the speed of the child at the
bottom depends only on the height of the slide.

Again, ⌬E is negative because friction is reducing mechanical
energy of the system (the ﬁnal mechanical energy is less than
the initial mechanical energy). Because the slide is curved,
the normal force changes in magnitude and direction during
the motion. Therefore, the frictional force, which is proportional to n, also changes during the motion. Given this changing frictional force, do you think it is possible to determine
␮k from these data?

Let’s Go Skiing!

A skier starts from rest at the top of a frictionless incline of
height 20.0 m, as shown in Figure 8.10. At the bottom of the
incline, she encounters a horizontal surface where the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction between the skis and the snow is
0.210. How far does she travel on the horizontal surface before coming to rest?

To ﬁnd the distance the skier travels before coming to
rest, we take KC ⫽ 0. With vB ⫽ 19.8 m/s and the frictional

Solution

First, let us calculate her speed at the bottom of
the incline, which we choose as our zero point of potential
energy. Because the incline is frictionless, the mechanical energy of the skier – Earth system remains constant, and we ﬁnd,
as we did in the previous example, that

EXAMPLE 8.7

The Spring-Loaded Popgun

The launching mechanism of a toy gun consists of a spring of
unknown spring constant (Fig. 8.11a). When the spring is
compressed 0.120 m, the gun, when ﬁred vertically, is able to
launch a 35.0-g projectile to a maximum height of 20.0 m
above the position of the projectile before ﬁring. (a) Neglecting all resistive forces, determine the spring constant.

Solution

Because the projectile starts from rest, the initial
kinetic energy is zero. If we take the zero point for the gravita-

tional potential energy of the projectile – Earth system to be at
the lowest position of the projectile x A , then the initial gravitational potential energy also is zero. The mechanical energy of
this system is constant because no nonconservative forces are
present.
Initially, the only mechanical energy in the system is the
elastic potential energy stored in the spring of the gun,
Us A ⫽ kx2/2, where the compression of the spring is
x ⫽ 0.120 m. The projectile rises to a maximum height

the maximum compression of the spring after the collision.

Solution Our system in this example consists of the block

because a frictional force acts on the block. The magnitude
of the frictional force is
the maximum compression of the spring, which in this case
happens to be x C . The total mechanical energy of the system
is conserved because no nonconservative forces act on objects within the system.

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

Connected Blocks in Motion

Two blocks are connected by a light string that passes over a
frictionless pulley, as shown in Figure 8.13. The block of mass
m1 lies on a horizontal surface and is connected to a spring of
force constant k. The system is released from rest when the
spring is unstretched. If the hanging block of mass m 2 falls a
distance h before coming to rest, calculate the coefﬁcient of
kinetic friction between the block of mass m1 and the surface.

where ⌬Ug ⫽ Ug f ⫺ Ug i is the change in the system’s gravitational potential energy and ⌬Us ⫽ Usf ⫺ Usi is the change in
the system’s elastic potential energy. As the hanging block
falls a distance h, the horizontally moving block moves the
same distance h to the right. Therefore, using Equation 8.15,
we ﬁnd that the loss in energy due to friction between the
horizontally sliding block and the surface is
(2)

Solution The key word rest appears twice in the problem
statement, telling us that the initial and ﬁnal velocities and kinetic energies are zero. (Also note that because we are concerned only with the beginning and ending points of the motion, we do not need to label events with circled letters as we
did in the previous two examples. Simply using i and f is sufﬁcient to keep track of the situation.) In this situation, the system consists of the two blocks, the spring, and the Earth. We
need to consider two forms of potential energy: gravitational
and elastic. Because the initial and ﬁnal kinetic energies of
the system are zero, ⌬K ⫽ 0, and we can write

This setup represents a way of measuring the coefﬁcient of
kinetic friction between an object and some surface. As you
can see from the problem, sometimes it is easier to work with
the changes in the various types of energy rather than the actual values. For example, if we wanted to calculate the numerical value of the gravitational potential energy associated with
the horizontally sliding block, we would need to specify the
height of the horizontal surface relative to the lowest position
of the falling block. Fortunately, this is not necessary because
the gravitational potential energy associated with the ﬁrst
block does not change.

A Grand Entrance

You are designing apparatus to support an actor of mass
65 kg who is to “ﬂy” down to the stage during the performance of a play. You decide to attach the actor’s harness to a
130-kg sandbag by means of a lightweight steel cable running
smoothly over two frictionless pulleys, as shown in Figure
8.14a. You need 3.0 m of cable between the harness and the
nearest pulley so that the pulley can be hidden behind a curtain. For the apparatus to work successfully, the sandbag must
never lift above the ﬂoor as the actor swings from above the

stage to the ﬂoor. Let us call the angle that the actor’s cable
makes with the vertical ␪. What is the maximum value ␪ can
have before the sandbag lifts off the ﬂoor?

Solution We need to draw on several concepts to solve
this problem. First, we use the principle of the conservation
of mechanical energy to ﬁnd the actor’s speed as he hits the
ﬂoor as a function of ␪ and the radius R of the circular path
through which he swings. Next, we apply Newton’s second

8.6

law to the actor at the bottom of his path to ﬁnd the cable
tension as a function of the given parameters. Finally, we note
that the sandbag lifts off the ﬂoor when the upward force exerted on it by the cable exceeds the gravitational force acting
on it; the normal force is zero when this happens.
Applying conservation of energy to the actor – Earth system gives

where yi is the initial height of the actor above the ﬂoor and vf is
the speed of the actor at the instant before he lands. (Note that
Ki ⫽ 0 because he starts from rest and that Uf ⫽ 0 because we
set the level of the actor’s harness when he is standing on the
ﬂoor as the zero level of potential energy.) From the geometry
in Figure 8.14a, we see that yi ⫽ R ⫺ R cos ␪ ⫽ R(1 ⫺ cos ␪).
Using this relationship in Equation (1), we obtain

A force of the same magnitude as T is transmitted to the

on it becomes zero, and we require that T ⫽ mbagg, as shown
in Figure 8.14c. Using this condition together with Equations

Notice that we did not need to be concerned with the length
R of the cable from the actor’s harness to the leftmost pulley.
The important point to be made from this problem is that it
is sometimes necessary to combine energy considerations

nent Fx acts on the particle. Earlier in this chapter, we showed how to determine
the change in potential energy of a system when we are given the conservative
force. We now show how to ﬁnd Fx if the potential energy of the system is known.
In Section 8.2 we learned that the work done by the conservative force as its
point of application undergoes a displacement ⌬x equals the negative of the
change in the potential energy associated with that force; that is,
W ⫽ Fx ⌬x ⫽ ⫺⌬U. If the point of application of the force undergoes an inﬁnitesimal displacement dx, we can express the inﬁnitesimal change in the potential energy of the system dU as
dU ⫽ ⫺Fx dx
Therefore, the conservative force is related to the potential energy function
through the relationship3
Fx ⫽ ⫺

That is, any conservative force acting on an object within a system equals the
negative derivative of the potential energy of the system with respect to x.
We can easily check this relationship for the two examples already discussed.

which corresponds to the restoring force in the spring. Because the gravitational
potential energy function is Ug ⫽ mgy, it follows from Equation 8.16 that
Fg ⫽ ⫺mg when we differentiate Ug with respect to y instead of x.
We now see that U is an important function because a conservative force can
be derived from it. Furthermore, Equation 8.16 should clarify the fact that adding
a constant to the potential energy is unimportant because the derivative of a constant is zero.

by the spring on the block is related to Us through Equation 8.16:
Fs ⫽ ⫺

dUs
⫽ ⫺kx
dx

As we saw in Quick Quiz 8.5, the force is equal to the negative of the slope of the
U versus x curve. When the block is placed at rest at the equilibrium position of
the spring (x ⫽ 0), where Fs ⫽ 0, it will remain there unless some external force
Fext acts on it. If this external force stretches the spring from equilibrium, x is positive and the slope dU/dx is positive; therefore, the force Fs exerted by the spring is
negative, and the block accelerates back toward x ⫽ 0 when released. If the external force compresses the spring, then x is negative and the slope is negative; therefore, Fs is positive, and again the mass accelerates toward x ⫽ 0 upon release.
From this analysis, we conclude that the x ⫽ 0 position for a block – spring system is one of stable equilibrium. That is, any movement away from this position
results in a force directed back toward x ⫽ 0. In general, positions of stable
equilibrium correspond to points for which U(x) is a minimum.
From Figure 8.15 we see that if the block is given an initial displacement xm
and is released from rest, its total energy initially is the potential energy stored in
the spring 21kxm2. As the block starts to move, the system acquires kinetic energy
and loses an equal amount of potential energy. Because the total energy must remain constant, the block oscillates (moves back and forth) between the two points
x ⫽ ⫺xm and x ⫽ ⫹xm , called the turning points. In fact, because no energy is lost
(no friction), the block will oscillate between ⫺ xm and ⫹ xm forever. (We discuss
these oscillations further in Chapter 13.) From an energy viewpoint, the energy of
the system cannot exceed 12kxm2; therefore, the block must stop at these points
and, because of the spring force, must accelerate toward x ⫽ 0.
Another simple mechanical system that has a position of stable equilibrium is
a ball rolling about in the bottom of a bowl. Anytime the ball is displaced from its
lowest position, it tends to return to that position when released.

233

234

CHAPTER 8

Now consider a particle moving along the x axis under the inﬂuence of a conservative force Fx , where the U versus x curve is as shown in Figure 8.16. Once
again, Fx ⫽ 0 at x ⫽ 0, and so the particle is in equilibrium at this point. However,
this is a position of unstable equilibrium for the following reason: Suppose that
the particle is displaced to the right (x ⬎ 0). Because the slope is negative for
x ⬎ 0, Fx ⫽ ⫺dU/dx is positive and the particle accelerates away from x ⫽ 0. If instead the particle is at x ⫽ 0 and is displaced to the left (x ⬍ 0), the force is negative because the slope is positive for x ⬍ 0, and the particle again accelerates away
from the equilibrium position. The position x ⫽ 0 in this situation is one of unstable equilibrium because for any displacement from this point, the force pushes the
particle farther away from equilibrium. The force pushes the particle toward a position of lower potential energy. A pencil balanced on its point is in a position of unstable equilibrium. If the pencil is displaced slightly from its absolutely vertical position and is then released, it will surely fall over. In general, positions of
unstable equilibrium correspond to points for which U(x) is a maximum.
Finally, a situation may arise where U is constant over some region and hence
Fx ⫽ 0. This is called a position of neutral equilibrium. Small displacements from
this position produce neither restoring nor disrupting forces. A ball lying on a ﬂat
horizontal surface is an example of an object in neutral equilibrium.

(a) Using a spreadsheet or similar tool, graph this function
and ﬁnd the most likely distance between the two atoms.

Solution We expect to ﬁnd stable equilibrium when the
two atoms are separated by some equilibrium distance and
the potential energy of the system of two atoms (the molecule) is a minimum. One can minimize the function U(x) by
taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero:

Solving for x — the equilibrium separation of the two atoms
in the molecule — and inserting the given information yield
x ⫽ 2.95 ⫻ 10⫺10 m.
We graph the Lennard – Jones function on both sides of
this critical value to create our energy diagram, as shown in
Figure 8.17a. Notice how U(x) is extremely large when the
atoms are very close together, is a minimum when the atoms

are at their critical separation, and then increases again as
the atoms move apart. When U(x) is a minimum, the atoms
are in stable equilbrium; this indicates that this is the most
likely separation between them.
(b) Determine Fx(x) — the force that one atom exerts on
the other in the molecule as a function of separation — and
argue that the way this force behaves is physically plausible
when the atoms are close together and far apart.

Solution Because the atoms combine to form a molecule,
we reason that the force must be attractive when the atoms
are far apart. On the other hand, the force must be repulsive
when the two atoms get very close together. Otherwise, the
molecule would collapse in on itself. Thus, the force must
change sign at the critical separation, similar to the way
spring forces switch sign in the change from extension to
compression. Applying Equation 8.16 to the Lennard – Jones
potential energy function gives

This result is graphed in Figure 8.17b. As expected, the force
is positive (repulsive) at small atomic separations, zero when
the atoms are at the position of stable equilibrium [recall
how we found the minimum of U(x)], and negative (attractive) at greater separations. Note that the force approaches
zero as the separation between the atoms becomes very great.

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY IN GENERAL

We have seen that the total mechanical energy of a system is constant when only
conservative forces act within the system. Furthermore, we can associate a potential energy function with each conservative force. On the other hand, as we saw in
Section 8.5, mechanical energy is lost when nonconservative forces such as friction
are present.
In our study of thermodynamics later in this course, we shall ﬁnd that mechanical energy can be transformed into energy stored inside the various objects
that make up the system. This form of energy is called internal energy. For example,
when a block slides over a rough surface, the mechanical energy lost because of
friction is transformed into internal energy that is stored temporarily inside the
block and inside the surface, as evidenced by a measurable increase in the temperature of both block and surface. We shall see that on a submicroscopic scale, this
internal energy is associated with the vibration of atoms about their equilibrium
positions. Such internal atomic motion involves both kinetic and potential energy.
Therefore, if we include in our energy expression this increase in the internal energy of the objects that make up the system, then energy is conserved.
This is just one example of how you can analyze an isolated system and always find that the total amount of energy it contains does not change, as long as
you account for all forms of energy. That is, energy can never be created or
destroyed. Energy may be transformed from one form to another, but the

Total energy is always conserved

236

CHAPTER 8

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

total energy of an isolated system is always constant. From a universal
point of view, we can say that the total energy of the Universe is constant. If
one part of the Universe gains energy in some form, then another part must
lose an equal amount of energy. No violation of this principle has ever been
found.

Optional Section

8.9

MASS – ENERGY EQUIVALENCE

This chapter has been concerned with the important principle of energy conservation and its application to various physical phenomena. Another important principle, conservation of mass, states that in any physical or chemical process,
mass is neither created nor destroyed. That is, the mass before the process
equals the mass after the process.
For centuries, scientists believed that energy and mass were two quantities that
were separately conserved. However, in 1905 Einstein made the brilliant discovery
that the mass of any system is a measure of the energy of that system. Hence, energy and mass are related concepts. The relationship between the two is given by
Einstein’s most famous formula:
E R ⫽ mc 2

(8.17)

where c is the speed of light and E R is the energy equivalent of a mass m. The subscript R on the energy refers to the rest energy of an object of mass m — that is,
the energy of the object when its speed is v ⫽ 0.
The rest energy associated with even a small amount of matter is enormous.
For example, the rest energy of 1 kg of any substance is
E R ⫽ mc 2 ⫽ (1 kg)(3 ⫻ 10 8 m/s)2 ⫽ 9 ⫻ 10 16 J
This is equivalent to the energy content of about 15 million barrels of crude oil —
about one day’s consumption in the United States! If this energy could easily be released as useful work, our energy resources would be unlimited.
In reality, only a small fraction of the energy contained in a material sample
can be released through chemical or nuclear processes. The effects are greatest in
nuclear reactions, in which fractional changes in energy, and hence mass, of approximately 10⫺3 are routinely observed. A good example is the enormous
amount of energy released when the uranium-235 nucleus splits into two smaller
nuclei. This happens because the sum of the masses of the product nuclei is
slightly less than the mass of the original 235 U nucleus. The awesome nature of the
energy released in such reactions is vividly demonstrated in the explosion of a nuclear weapon.
Equation 8.17 indicates that energy has mass. Whenever the energy of an object
changes in any way, its mass changes as well. If ⌬E is the change in energy of an object, then its change in mass is
⌬m ⫽

⌬E
c2

(8.18)

Anytime energy ⌬E in any form is supplied to an object, the change in the mass of
the object is ⌬m ⫽ ⌬E/c 2. However, because c 2 is so large, the changes in mass in
any ordinary mechanical experiment or chemical reaction are too small to be
detected.

8.10 Quantization of Energy

EXAMPLE 8.12

Here Comes the Sun

The Sun converts an enormous amount of matter to energy.
Each second, 4.19 ⫻ 109 kg — approximately the capacity of
400 average-sized cargo ships — is changed to energy. What is
the power output of the Sun?

Solution We ﬁnd the energy liberated per second by
means of a straightforward conversion:
ER ⫽ (4.19 ⫻ 109 kg)(3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s)2 ⫽ 3.77 ⫻ 1026 J
We then apply the deﬁnition of power:
ᏼ⫽

3.77 ⫻ 1026 J
⫽
1.00 s

The Sun radiates uniformly in all directions, and so only a
very tiny fraction of its total output is collected by the Earth.
Nonetheless this amount is sufﬁcient to supply energy to
nearly everything on the Earth. (Nuclear and geothermal energy are the only alternatives.) Plants absorb solar energy and
convert it to chemical potential energy (energy stored in the
plant’s molecules). When an animal eats the plant, this chemical potential energy can be turned into kinetic and other
forms of energy. You are reading this book with solarpowered eyes!

QUANTIZATION OF ENERGY

Certain physical quantities such as electric charge are quantized; that is, the quantities have discrete values rather than continuous values. The quantized nature of
energy is especially important in the atomic and subatomic world. As an example,
let us consider the energy levels of the hydrogen atom (which consists of an electron orbiting around a proton). The atom can occupy only certain energy levels,
called quantum states, as shown in Figure 8.18a. The atom cannot have any energy
values lying between these quantum states. The lowest energy level E 1 is called the

CHAPTER 8

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

ground state of the atom. The ground state corresponds to the state that an isolated
atom usually occupies. The atom can move to higher energy states by absorbing
energy from some external source or by colliding with other atoms. The highest
energy on the scale shown in Figure 8.18a, E ⬁ , corresponds to the energy of the
atom when the electron is completely removed from the proton. The energy difference E⬁ ⫺ E1 is called the ionization energy. Note that the energy levels get
closer together at the high end of the scale.
Next, consider a satellite in orbit about the Earth. If you were asked to describe the possible energies that the satellite could have, it would be reasonable
(but incorrect) to say that it could have any arbitrary energy value. Just like that of
the hydrogen atom, however, the energy of the satellite is quantized. If you
were to construct an energy level diagram for the satellite showing its allowed energies, the levels would be so close to one another, as shown in Figure 8.18b, that it
would be difﬁcult to discern that they were not continuous. In other words, we
have no way of experiencing quantization of energy in the macroscopic world;
hence, we can ignore it in describing everyday experiences.

You should be able to apply these two equations in a variety of situations to determine the potential an object has to perform work.
A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between two
points is independent of the path the particle takes between the two points. Furthermore, a force is conservative if the work it does on a particle is zero when the
particle moves through an arbitrary closed path and returns to its initial position.
A force that does not meet these criteria is said to be nonconservative.
A potential energy function U can be associated only with a conservative
force. If a conservative force F acts on a particle that moves along the x axis from
x i to xf , then the change in the potential energy of the system equals the negative
of the work done by that force:

If nonconservative forces (such as friction) act on objects inside a system, then
mechanical energy is not conserved. In these situations, the difference between the
total ﬁnal mechanical energy and the total initial mechanical energy of the system
equals the energy transferred to or from the system by the nonconservative forces.

Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
8.1 Yes, because we are free to choose any point whatsoever
as our origin of coordinates, which is the Ug ⫽ 0 point.
If the object is below the origin of coordinates that we
choose, then Ug ⬍ 0 for the object – Earth system.
8.2 Yes, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved because the only forces acting are conservative:
the force of gravity and the spring force. There are two
forms of potential energy: (1) gravitational potential energy and (2) elastic potential energy stored in the spring.
8.3 The ﬁrst and third balls speed up after they are thrown,
while the second ball initially slows down but then
speeds up after reaching its peak. The paths of all three
balls are parabolas, and the balls take different times to
reach the ground because they have different initial velocities. However, all three balls have the same speed at
the moment they hit the ground because all start with
the same kinetic energy and undergo the same change
in gravitational potential energy. In other words,
E total ⫽ 12mv 2 ⫹ mgh is the same for all three balls at the
start of the motion.
8.4 Designate one object as No. 1 and the other as No. 2.
The external force does work Wapp on the system. If

Wapp ⬎ 0, then the system energy increases. If Wapp ⬍ 0,
then the system energy decreases. The effect of friction
is to decrease the total system energy. Equation 8.15
then becomes

You may ﬁnd it easier to think of this equation with its

8.5 The slope of a U(x)-versus-x graph is by deﬁnition
dU(x)/dx. From Equation 8.16, we see that this expression is equal to the negative of the x component of the
conservative force acting on an object that is part of the

onsider what happens when a golf ball is struck by a club. The ball is given a
very large initial velocity as a result of the collision; consequently, it is able to
travel more than 100 m through the air. The ball experiences a large acceleration. Furthermore, because the ball experiences this acceleration over a very short
time interval, the average force exerted on it during the collision is very great. According to Newton’s third law, the ball exerts on the club a reaction force that is
equal in magnitude to and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the club
on the ball. This reaction force causes the club to accelerate. Because the club is
much more massive than the ball, however, the acceleration of the club is much
less than the acceleration of the ball.
One of the main objectives of this chapter is to enable you to understand and
analyze such events. As a ﬁrst step, we introduce the concept of momentum, which is
useful for describing objects in motion and as an alternate and more general
means of applying Newton’s laws. For example, a very massive football player is often said to have a great deal of momentum as he runs down the ﬁeld. A much less
massive player, such as a halfback, can have equal or greater momentum if his
speed is greater than that of the more massive player. This follows from the fact
that momentum is deﬁned as the product of mass and velocity. The concept of
momentum leads us to a second conservation law, that of conservation of momentum. This law is especially useful for treating problems that involve collisions between objects and for analyzing rocket propulsion. The concept of the center of
mass of a system of particles also is introduced, and we shall see that the motion of
a system of particles can be described by the motion of one representative particle
located at the center of mass.

9.1

LINEAR MOMENTUM AND ITS CONSERVATION

In the preceding two chapters we studied situations too complex to analyze easily
with Newton’s laws. In fact, Newton himself used a form of his second law slightly
different from F  ma (Eq. 5.2) — a form that is considerably easier to apply in
complicated circumstances. Physicists use this form to study everything from subatomic particles to rocket propulsion. In studying situations such as these, it is often useful to know both something about the object and something about its motion. We start by deﬁning a new term that incorporates this information:
Deﬁnition of linear momentum of
a particle

The linear momentum of a particle of mass m moving with a velocity v is deﬁned to be the product of the mass and velocity:
p ⬅ mv

6.2

(9.1)

Linear momentum is a vector quantity because it equals the product of a scalar
quantity m and a vector quantity v. Its direction is along v, it has dimensions
ML/T, and its SI unit is kg  m/s.
If a particle is moving in an arbitrary direction, p must have three components, and Equation 9.1 is equivalent to the component equations
px  mvx

py  mvy

pz  mvz

(9.2)

As you can see from its deﬁnition, the concept of momentum provides a quantitative distinction between heavy and light particles moving at the same velocity. For
example, the momentum of a bowling ball moving at 10 m/s is much greater than
that of a tennis ball moving at the same speed. Newton called the product mv

quantity of motion; this is perhaps a more graphic description than our present-day
word momentum, which comes from the Latin word for movement.

Quick Quiz 9.1
Two objects have equal kinetic energies. How do the magnitudes of their momenta compare? (a) p 1  p 2 , (b) p 1  p 2 , (c) p 1  p 2 , (d) not enough information to tell.

Using Newton’s second law of motion, we can relate the linear momentum of a
particle to the resultant force acting on the particle: The time rate of change of the
linear momentum of a particle is equal to the net force acting on the particle:

F 

Newton’s second law for a particle

(9.3)

In addition to situations in which the velocity vector varies with time, we can
use Equation 9.3 to study phenomena in which the mass changes. The real value
of Equation 9.3 as a tool for analysis, however, stems from the fact that when the
net force acting on a particle is zero, the time derivative of the momentum of the
particle is zero, and therefore its linear momentum1 is constant. Of course, if
the particle is isolated, then by necessity  F  0 and p remains unchanged. This
means that p is conserved. Just as the law of conservation of energy is useful in
solving complex motion problems, the law of conservation of momentum can
greatly simplify the analysis of other types of complicated motion.

Conservation of Momentum for a Two-Particle System
6.2

Consider two particles 1 and 2 that can interact with each other but are isolated
from their surroundings (Fig. 9.1). That is, the particles may exert a force on each
other, but no external forces are present. It is important to note the impact of
Newton’s third law on this analysis. If an internal force from particle 1 (for example, a gravitational force) acts on particle 2, then there must be a second internal
force — equal in magnitude but opposite in direction — that particle 2 exerts on
particle 1.
Suppose that at some instant, the momentum of particle 1 is p1 and that of
particle 2 is p2 . Applying Newton’s second law to each particle, we can write
dp1
F21 
dt

and

d p2
F12 
dt

where F21 is the force exerted by particle 2 on particle 1 and F12 is the force exerted by particle 1 on particle 2. Newton’s third law tells us that F12 and F21 are
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That is, they form an action – reaction pair F12   F21 . We can express this condition as
F21  F12  0

where pli and p2i are the initial values and p1f and p2f the ﬁnal values of the momentum during the time interval dt over which the reaction pair interacts. Equation 9.5 in component form demonstrates that the total momenta in the x, y, and z
directions are all independently conserved:

This result, known as the law of conservation of linear momentum, can be extended to any number of particles in an isolated system. It is considered one of the
most important laws of mechanics. We can state it as follows:

Conservation of momentum

Whenever two or more particles in an isolated system interact, the total momentum of the system remains constant.
This law tells us that the total momentum of an isolated system at all times
equals its initial momentum.
Notice that we have made no statement concerning the nature of the forces
acting on the particles of the system. The only requirement is that the forces must
be internal to the system.

EXAMPLE 9.1

The Floating Astronaut

A SkyLab astronaut discovered that while concentrating on
writing some notes, he had gradually ﬂoated to the middle of
an open area in the spacecraft. Not wanting to wait until he
ﬂoated to the opposite side, he asked his colleagues for a
push. Laughing at his predicament, they decided not to help,
and so he had to take off his uniform and throw it in one direction so that he would be propelled in the opposite direction. Estimate his resulting velocity.

Solution We begin by making some reasonable guesses of
relevant data. Let us assume we have a 70-kg astronaut who
threw his 1-kg uniform at a speed of 20 m/s. For conve-

somewhere.

v2f

A hapless astronaut has discarded his uniform to get

9.2
nience, we set the positive direction of the x axis to be the direction of the throw (Fig. 9.2). Let us also assume that the x
axis is tangent to the circular path of the spacecraft.
We take the system to consist of the astronaut and the uniform. Because of the gravitational force (which keeps the astronaut, his uniform, and the entire spacecraft in orbit), the
system is not really isolated. However, this force is directed
perpendicular to the motion of the system. Therefore, momentum is constant in the x direction because there are no
external forces in this direction.
The total momentum of the system before the throw is
zero (m1v1i  m2v2i  0). Therefore, the total momentum after the throw must be zero; that is,

255

Impulse and Momentum

With m1  70 kg, v2f  20i m/s, and m2  1 kg, solving for
v1f , we ﬁnd the recoil velocity of the astronaut to be

The negative sign for v1f indicates that the astronaut is moving to the left after the throw, in the direction opposite the
direction of motion of the uniform, in accordance with Newton’s third law. Because the astronaut is much more massive
than his uniform, his acceleration and consequent velocity
are much smaller than the acceleration and velocity of the
uniform.

Breakup of a Kaon at Rest

One type of nuclear particle, called the neutral kaon (K0 ),
breaks up into a pair of other particles called pions (  and
 ) that are oppositely charged but equal in mass, as illustrated in Figure 9.3. Assuming the kaon is initially at rest,
prove that the two pions must have momenta that are equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Solution

The important point behind this problem is that even though
it deals with objects that are very different from those in the
preceding example, the physics is identical: Linear momentum is conserved in an isolated system.

The breakup of the kaon can be written

IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM

As we have seen, the momentum of a particle changes if a net force acts on the
particle. Knowing the change in momentum caused by a force is useful in solving
some types of problems. To begin building a better understanding of this important concept, let us assume that a single force F acts on a particle and that this
force may vary with time. According to Newton’s second law, F  d p/dt, or
dp  F dt

We can
this expression to ﬁnd the change in the momentum of a particle when the force acts over some time interval. If the momentum of the particle

To evaluate the integral, we need to know how the force varies with time. The
quantity on the right side of this equation is called the impulse of the force F acting on a particle over the time interval t  tf  ti . Impulse is a vector deﬁned by

This statement, known as the impulse – momentum theorem,3 is equivalent to
Newton’s second law. From this deﬁnition, we see that impulse is a vector quantity
having a magnitude equal to the area under the force – time curve, as described in
Figure 9.4a. In this ﬁgure, it is assumed that the force varies in time in the general
manner shown and is nonzero in the time interval t  tf  ti . The direction of
the impulse vector is the same as the direction of the change in momentum. Impulse has the dimensions of momentum — that is, ML/T. Note that impulse is not
a property of a particle; rather, it is a measure of the degree to which an external
force changes the momentum of the particle. Therefore, when we say that an impulse is given to a particle, we mean that momentum is transferred from an external agent to that particle.
Because the force imparting an impulse can generally vary in time, it is convenient to deﬁne a time-averaged force

time interval t, the time-averaged
force (horizontal dashed line)
gives the same impulse to a particle
as does the time-varying force described in part (a).

This time-averaged force, described in Figure 9.4b, can be thought of as the constant force that would give to the particle in the time interval t the same impulse
that the time-varying force gives over this same interval.
In principle, if F is known as a function of time, the impulse can be calculated
from Equation 9.9. The calculation becomes especially simple if the force acting
on the particle is constant. In this case, F  F and Equation 9.11 becomes

In many physical situations, we shall use what is called the impulse approximation, in which we assume that one of the forces exerted on a particle acts
for a short time but is much greater than any other force present. This approximation is especially useful in treating collisions in which the duration of the

Impulse and Momentum

During the brief time the club is in contact with the ball, the ball gains momentum as a result of
the collision, and the club loses the same amount of momentum.

collision is very short. When this approximation is made, we refer to the force as
an impulsive force. For example, when a baseball is struck with a bat, the time of the
collision is about 0.01 s and the average force that the bat exerts on the ball in this
time is typically several thousand newtons. Because this is much greater than the
magnitude of the gravitational force, the impulse approximation justiﬁes our ignoring the weight of the ball and bat. When we use this approximation, it is important to remember that pi and pf represent the momenta immediately before and after the collision, respectively. Therefore, in any situation in which it is proper to
use the impulse approximation, the particle moves very little during the collision.

COLLISIONS

In this section we use the law of conservation of linear momentum to describe
what happens when two particles collide. We use the term collision to represent
the event of two particles’ coming together for a short time and thereby producing
impulsive forces on each other. These forces are assumed to be much greater
than any external forces present.
A collision may entail physical contact between two macroscopic objects, as described in Figure 9.7a, but the notion of what we mean by collision must be generalized because “physical contact” on a submicroscopic scale is ill-deﬁned and
hence meaningless. To understand this, consider a collision on an atomic scale
(Fig. 9.7b), such as the collision of a proton with an alpha particle (the nucleus of
a helium atom). Because the particles are both positively charged, they never
come into physical contact with each other; instead, they repel each other because
of the strong electrostatic force between them at close separations. When two particles 1 and 2 of masses m1 and m 2 collide as shown in Figure 9.7, the impulsive
forces may vary in time in complicated ways, one of which is described in Figure
9.8. If F21 is the force exerted by particle 2 on particle 1, and if we assume that no
external forces act on the particles, then the change in momentum of particle 1
due to the collision is given by Equation 9.8:

This is precisely what we expect because no external forces are acting on the system (see Section 9.2). Because the impulsive forces are internal, they do not
change the total momentum of the system (only external forces can do that).

the rear by a 900-kg car, and the two become entangled. If
the smaller car was moving at 20.0 m/s before the collision,
what is the velocity of the entangled cars after the collision?

Solution We can guess that the ﬁnal speed is less than
20.0 m/s, the initial speed of the smaller car. The total momentum of the system (the two cars) before the collision
must equal the total momentum immediately after the collision because momentum is conserved in any type of collision.
The magnitude of the total momentum before the collision is
equal to that of the smaller car because the larger car is initially at rest:

Elastic collision

9.4

ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIONS
IN ONE DIMENSION

As we have seen, momentum is conserved in any collision in which external forces
are negligible. In contrast, kinetic energy may or may not be constant, depending on the type of collision. In fact, whether or not kinetic energy is the same before
and after the collision is used to classify collisions as being either elastic or inelastic.
An elastic collision between two objects is one in which total kinetic energy (as
well as total momentum) is the same before and after the collision. Billiard-ball collisions
and the collisions of air molecules with the walls of a container at ordinary temperatures are approximately elastic. Truly elastic collisions do occur, however, between
atomic and subatomic particles. Collisions between certain objects in the macroscopic world, such as billiard-ball collisions, are only approximately elastic because
some deformation and loss of kinetic energy take place.

9.4

261

Elastic and Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension

An inelastic collision is one in which total kinetic energy is not the same before and
after the collision (even though momentum is constant). Inelastic collisions are of two
types. When the colliding objects stick together after the collision, as happens
when a meteorite collides with the Earth, the collision is called perfectly inelastic.
When the colliding objects do not stick together, but some kinetic energy is lost, as
in the case of a rubber ball colliding with a hard surface, the collision is called inelastic (with no modifying adverb). For example, when a rubber ball collides with
a hard surface, the collision is inelastic because some of the kinetic energy of the
ball is lost when the ball is deformed while it is in contact with the surface.
In most collisions, kinetic energy is not the same before and after the collision
because some of it is converted to internal energy, to elastic potential energy when
the objects are deformed, and to rotational energy. Elastic and perfectly inelastic
collisions are limiting cases; most collisions fall somewhere between them.
In the remainder of this section, we treat collisions in one dimension and consider the two extreme cases — perfectly inelastic and elastic collisions. The important distinction between these two types of collisions is that momentum is constant in all collisions, but kinetic energy is constant only in elastic
collisions.

the collision:

if it moves to the left. As has been seen in earlier chapters, it is common practice
to call these values “speed” even though this term technically refers to the magnitude of the velocity vector, which does not have an algebraic sign.
In a typical problem involving elastic collisions, there are two unknown quantities, and Equations 9.15 and 9.16 can be solved simultaneously to ﬁnd these. An alternative approach, however — one that involves a little mathematical manipulation of Equation 9.16 — often simpliﬁes this process. To see how, let us cancel the
factor 12 in Equation 9.16 and rewrite it as
m1(v1i2  v1f 2 )  m2(v2f 2  v2i2 )
and then factor both sides:
m1(v1i  v1f )(v1i  v1f )  m2(v2f  v2i )(v2f  v2i )

(9.17)

Next, let us separate the terms containing m1 and m 2 in Equation 9.15 to get
m1(v1i  v1f )  m2(v2f  v2i )

(9.18)

To obtain our ﬁnal result, we divide Equation 9.17 by Equation 9.18 and get
v1i  v1f  v2f  v2i
v1i  v2i  (v1f  v2f )

(9.19)

This equation, in combination with Equation 9.15, can be used to solve problems
dealing with elastic collisions. According to Equation 9.19, the relative speed of
the two particles before the collision v1i  v2i equals the negative of their relative
speed after the collision, (v1f  v2f ).
Suppose that the masses and initial velocities of both particles are known.
Equations 9.15 and 9.19 can be solved for the ﬁnal speeds in terms of the initial
speeds because there are two equations and two unknowns:

It is important to remember that the appropriate signs for v1i and v2i must be included in Equations 9.20 and 9.21. For example, if particle 2 is moving to the left
initially, then v2i is negative.
Let us consider some special cases: If m1  m 2 , then v1f  v2i and v2f  v1i .
That is, the particles exchange speeds if they have equal masses. This is approximately what one observes in head-on billiard ball collisions — the cue ball stops,
and the struck ball moves away from the collision with the same speed that the cue
ball had.
If particle 2 is initially at rest, then v2i  0 and Equations 9.20 and 9.21 become

tion unaltered after the collision, and the light particle rebounds with a speed
equal to about twice the initial speed of the heavy particle. An example of such a
collision would be that of a moving heavy atom, such as uranium, with a light
atom, such as hydrogen.
If m 2 is much greater than m1 and particle 2 is initially at rest, then v1f ⬇ v1i

the heavy one remains approximately at rest.

The Ballistic Pendulum

The ballistic pendulum (Fig. 9.11) is a system used to measure the speed of a fast-moving projectile, such as a bullet.
The bullet is ﬁred into a large block of wood suspended from
some light wires. The bullet embeds in the block, and the entire system swings through a height h. The collision is perfectly inelastic, and because momentum is conserved, Equation 9.14 gives the speed of the system right after the
collision, when we assume the impulse approximation. If we
call the bullet particle 1 and the block particle 2, the total kinetic energy right after the collision is
(1)

Note that this kinetic energy immediately after the collision is
less than the initial kinetic energy of the bullet. In all the energy changes that take place after the collision, however, the
total amount of mechanical energy remains constant; thus,
we can say that after the collision, the kinetic energy of the
block and bullet at the bottom is transformed to potential energy at the height h:

This expression tells us that it is possible to obtain the initial

Because the collision is perfectly inelastic, some mechanical energy is converted to internal energy and it would be incorrect to equate the initial kinetic energy of the incoming
bullet to the ﬁnal gravitational potential energy of the
bullet – block combination.

A block of mass m 1  1.60 kg initially moving to the right with

as in Figure 9.12b, determine the velocity of block 2.

Solution

First, note that the initial velocity of block 2 is

Slowing Down Neutrons by Collisions

In a nuclear reactor, neutrons are produced when a 235
92U
atom splits in a process called ﬁssion. These neutrons are
moving at about 107 m/s and must be slowed down to about
103 m/s before they take part in another ﬁssion event. They
are slowed down by being passed through a solid or liquid
material called a moderator. The slowing-down process involves
elastic collisions. Let us show that a neutron can lose most of
its kinetic energy if it collides elastically with a moderator
containing light nuclei, such as deuterium (in “heavy water,”
D2O) or carbon (in graphite).

Solution Let us assume that the moderator nucleus of
mass mm is at rest initially and that a neutron of mass mn and
initial speed vni collides with it head-on.
Because these are elastic collisions, the ﬁrst thing we do is
recognize that both momentum and kinetic energy are constant. Therefore, Equations 9.22 and 9.23 can be applied to
the head-on collision of a neutron with a moderator nucleus.
We can represent this process by a drawing such as Figure
9.10.
The initial kinetic energy of the neutron is

After the collision, the neutron has kinetic energy 12 mnvnf 2,
and we can substitute into this the value for vnf given by
Equation 9.22:

From this result, we see that the ﬁnal kinetic energy of the
neutron is small when mm is close to mn and zero when mn 

We can use Equation 9.23, which gives the ﬁnal speed of
the particle that was initially at rest, to calculate the kinetic
energy of the moderator nucleus after the collision:

An ingenious device that illustrates conservation of momentum and kinetic energy is shown
in Figure 9.13a. It consists of ﬁve identical hard balls supported by strings of equal lengths.
When ball 1 is pulled out and released, after the almost-elastic collision between it and ball
2, ball 5 moves out, as shown in Figure 9.13b. If balls 1 and 2 are pulled out and released,
balls 4 and 5 swing out, and so forth. Is it ever possible that, when ball 1 is released, balls 4
and 5 will swing out on the opposite side and travel with half the speed of ball 1, as in Figure 9.13c?

Because the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved,

Suppose that heavy water is used for the moderator. For
collisions of the neutrons with deuterium nuclei in D2O
(mm  2mn), fn  1/9 and fm  8/9. That is, 89% of the
neutron’s kinetic energy is transferred to the deuterium nucleus. In practice, the moderator efﬁciency is reduced because head-on collisions are very unlikely.
How do the results differ when graphite (12C, as found in
pencil lead) is used as the moderator?

Linear Momentum and Collisions

TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLLISIONS

In Sections 9.1 and 9.3, we showed that the momentum of a system of two particles
is constant when the system is isolated. For any collision of two particles, this result
implies that the momentum in each of the directions x, y, and z is constant. However, an important subset of collisions takes place in a plane. The game of billiards
is a familiar example involving multiple collisions of objects moving on a twodimensional surface. For such two-dimensional collisions, we obtain two component equations for conservation of momentum:
m1v1ix  m2v2ix  m1v1fx  m2v2 fx
m1v1iy  m2v2iy  m1v1fy  m2v2fy
Let us consider a two-dimensional problem in which particle 1 of mass m1 collides with particle 2 of mass m 2 , where particle 2 is initially at rest, as shown in Figure 9.14. After the collision, particle 1 moves at an angle with respect to the horizontal and particle 2 moves at an angle with respect to the horizontal. This is
called a glancing collision. Applying the law of conservation of momentum in component form, and noting that the initial y component of the momentum of the
two-particle system is zero, we obtain
m1v1i  m1v1f cos

 m2v2f cos

(9.24)

0  m1v1f sin

 m2v2f sin

(9.25)

where the minus sign in Equation 9.25 comes from the fact that after the collision,
particle 2 has a y component of velocity that is downward. We now have two independent equations. As long as no more than two of the seven quantities in Equations 9.24 and 9.25 are unknown, we can solve the problem.
If the collision is elastic, we can also use Equation 9.16 (conservation of kinetic
energy), with v2i  0, to give
1

 12 m1v1f 2  12 m2v2f 2

Knowing the initial speed of particle 1 and both masses, we are left with four unknowns (v1f , v2f , , ). Because we have only three equations, one of the four remaining quantities must be given if we are to determine the motion after the collision from conservation principles alone.
If the collision is inelastic, kinetic energy is not conserved and Equation 9.26
does not apply.

Two-Dimensional Collisions

Problem-Solving Hints
Collisions
The following procedure is recommended when dealing with problems involving collisions between two objects:
• Set up a coordinate system and deﬁne your velocities with respect to that system. It is usually convenient to have the x axis coincide with one of the initial velocities.
• In your sketch of the coordinate system, draw and label all velocity vectors
and include all the given information.
• Write expressions for the x and y components of the momentum of each object before and after the collision. Remember to include the appropriate
signs for the components of the velocity vectors.
• Write expressions for the total momentum in the x direction before and after the collision and equate the two. Repeat this procedure for the total momentum in the y direction. These steps follow from the fact that, because
the momentum of the system is conserved in any collision, the total momentum along any direction must also be constant. Remember, it is the momentum of the system that is constant, not the momenta of the individual objects.
• If the collision is inelastic, kinetic energy is not conserved, and additional information is probably required. If the collision is perfectly inelastic, the ﬁnal
velocities of the two objects are equal. Solve the momentum equations for
the unknown quantities.
• If the collision is elastic, kinetic energy is conserved, and you can equate the
total kinetic energy before the collision to the total kinetic energy after the
collision to get an additional relationship between the velocities.

EXAMPLE 9.9

Collision at an Intersection

A 1 500-kg car traveling east with a speed of 25.0 m/s collides
at an intersection with a 2 500-kg van traveling north at a
speed of 20.0 m/s, as shown in Figure 9.15. Find the direction and magnitude of the velocity of the wreckage after the
collision, assuming that the vehicles undergo a perfectly inelastic collision (that is, they stick together).

Solution Let us choose east to be along the positive x direction and north to be along the positive y direction. Before
the collision, the only object having momentum in the x direction is the car. Thus, the magnitude of the total initial momentum of the system (car plus van) in the x direction is

Proton – Proton Collision

Proton 1 collides elastically with proton 2 that is initially at
rest. Proton 1 has an initial speed of 3.50 105 m/s and
makes a glancing collision with proton 2, as was shown in Figure 9.14. After the collision, proton 1 moves at an angle of
37.0° to the horizontal axis, and proton 2 deﬂects at an angle
to the same axis. Find the ﬁnal speeds of the two protons
and the angle .

Solution Because both particles are protons, we know that
m1  m 2 . We also know that  37.0° and v1i  3.50
105 m/s. Equations 9.24, 9.25, and 9.26 become

next example illustrates this point in more detail.

Billiard Ball Collision

In a game of billiards, a player wishes to sink a target ball 2 in
the corner pocket, as shown in Figure 9.16. If the angle to the
corner pocket is 35°, at what angle is the cue ball 1 deﬂected? Assume that friction and rotational motion are unimportant and that the collision is elastic.

The Center of Mass

This result shows that whenever two equal masses undergo a
glancing elastic collision and one of them is initially at rest,
they move at right angles to each other after the collision.
The same physics describes two very different situations, protons in Example 9.10 and billiard balls in this example.

THE CENTER OF MASS

In this section we describe the overall motion of a mechanical system in terms of a
special point called the center of mass of the system. The mechanical system can
be either a system of particles, such as a collection of atoms in a container, or an
extended object, such as a gymnast leaping through the air. We shall see that the
center of mass of the system moves as if all the mass of the system were concentrated at that point. Furthermore, if the resultant external force on the system is
Fext and the total mass of the system is M, the center of mass moves with an acceleration given by a  Fext /M. That is, the system moves as if the resultant external force were applied to a single particle of mass M located at the center of mass.
This behavior is independent of other motion, such as rotation or vibration of the
system. This result was implicitly assumed in earlier chapters because many examples referred to the motion of extended objects that were treated as particles.
Consider a mechanical system consisting of a pair of particles that have different masses and are connected by a light, rigid rod (Fig. 9.17). One can describe the
position of the center of mass of a system as being the average position of the system’s
mass. The center of mass of the system is located somewhere on the line joining the

between the more massive particle
and the center of mass. (c) The system moves in the direction of the
force without rotating when a force
is applied at the center of mass.

particles and is closer to the particle having the larger mass. If a single force is applied at some point on the rod somewhere between the center of mass and the less
massive particle, the system rotates clockwise (see Fig. 9.17a). If the force is applied
at a point on the rod somewhere between the center of mass and the more massive
particle, the system rotates counterclockwise (see Fig. 9.17b). If the force is applied
at the center of mass, the system moves in the direction of F without rotating (see
Fig. 9.17c). Thus, the center of mass can be easily located.
The center of mass of the pair of particles described in Figure 9.18 is located
on the x axis and lies somewhere between the particles. Its x coordinate is
xCM ⬅

m1x1  m2 x2
m1  m2

(9.27)

For example, if x1  0, x2  d, and m2  2m1 , we ﬁnd that xCM  23 d. That is, the
center of mass lies closer to the more massive particle. If the two masses are equal,
the center of mass lies midway between the particles.
We can extend this concept to a system of many particles in three dimensions.

Although locating the center of mass for an extended object is somewhat
more cumbersome than locating the center of mass of a system of particles, the basic ideas we have discussed still apply. We can think of an extended object as a system containing a large number of particles (Fig. 9.19). The particle separation is
very small, and so the object can be considered to have a continuous mass distribution. By dividing the object into elements of mass mi , with coordinates xi , yi , zi ,
we see that the x coordinate of the center of mass is approximately

The center of mass of any symmetric object lies on an axis of symmetry
and on any plane of symmetry.4 For example, the center of mass of a rod lies in
the rod, midway between its ends. The center of mass of a sphere or a cube lies at
its geometric center.
One can determine the center of mass of an irregularly shaped object by suspending the object ﬁrst from one point and then from another. In Figure 9.20, a
wrench is hung from point A, and a vertical line AB (which can be established with
a plumb bob) is drawn when the wrench has stopped swinging. The wrench is then
hung from point C, and a second vertical line CD is drawn. The center of mass is
halfway through the thickness of the wrench, under the intersection of these two
lines. In general, if the wrench is hung freely from any point, the vertical line
through this point must pass through the center of mass.
Because an extended object is a continuous distribution of mass, each small
mass element is acted upon by the force of gravity. The net effect of all these
forces is equivalent to the effect of a single force, Mg, acting through a special
point, called the center of gravity. If g is constant over the mass distribution,
then the center of gravity coincides with the center of mass. If an extended object
is pivoted at its center of gravity, it balances in any orientation.

opposite your starting side. The center of mass for the triangle must lie
on this bisector of the angle. Repeat
these steps for the other two sides.
The three angle bisectors you have

mass of the triangle. If you poke a

density), then   M/L for the uniform rod we assume here.
If we divide the rod into elements of length dx, then the mass
of each element is dm   dx. For an arbitrary element located a distance x from the origin, Equation 9.31 gives

The Center of Mass of a Right Triangle

An object of mass M is in the shape of a right triangle whose

With this substitution, x CM becomes

By inspection we can estimate that the x coordinate of the center of mass must be past the center of the
base, that is, greater than a/2, because the largest part of the
triangle lies beyond that point. A similar argument indicates
that its y coordinate must be less than b/2. To evaluate the x
coordinate, we divide the triangle into narrow strips of width

MOTION OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES

Therefore, we conclude that the total linear momentum of the system equals
the total mass multiplied by the velocity of the center of mass. In other words, the
total linear momentum of the system is equal to that of a single particle of mass M
moving with a velocity vCM .
If we now differentiate Equation 9.34 with respect to time, we get the acceleration of the center of mass of the system:

where Fi is the net force on particle i.
The forces on any particle in the system may include both external forces
(from outside the system) and internal forces (from within the system). However,
by Newton’s third law, the internal force exerted by particle 1 on particle 2, for example, is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the internal force exerted by particle 2 on particle 1. Thus, when we sum over all internal forces in
Equation 9.37, they cancel in pairs and the net force on the system is caused only
by external forces. Thus, we can write Equation 9.37 in the form
Newton’s second law for a system
of particles

That is, the resultant external force on a system of particles equals the total mass

this with Newton’s second law for a single particle, we see that
The center of mass of a system of particles of combined mass M moves like an
equivalent particle of mass M would move under the inﬂuence of the resultant
external force on the system.
Finally, we see that if the resultant external force is zero, then from Equation

(when Fext  0)

(9.39)

That is, the total linear momentum of a system of particles is conserved if no net
external force is acting on the system. It follows that for an isolated system of particles, both the total momentum and the velocity of the center of mass are constant
in time, as shown in Figure 9.25. This is a generalization to a many-particle system
of the law of conservation of momentum discussed in Section 9.1 for a two-particle
system.
Suppose an isolated system consisting of two or more members is at rest. The
center of mass of such a system remains at rest unless acted upon by an external
force. For example, consider a system made up of a swimmer standing on a raft,
with the system initially at rest. When the swimmer dives horizontally off the raft,
the center of mass of the system remains at rest (if we neglect friction between raft
and water). Furthermore, the linear momentum of the diver is equal in magnitude
to that of the raft but opposite in direction.
As another example, suppose an unstable atom initially at rest suddenly breaks
up into two fragments of masses MA and MB , with velocities vA and vB , respectively.
Because the total momentum of the system before the breakup is zero, the total
momentum of the system after the breakup must also be zero. Therefore,
MAvA  MBvB  0. If the velocity of one of the fragments is known, the recoil velocity of the other fragment can be calculated.

The Sliding Bear

Suppose you tranquilize a polar bear on a smooth glacier as
part of a research effort. How might you estimate the bear’s
mass using a measuring tape, a rope, and knowledge of your
own mass?

Solution Tie one end of the rope around the bear, and
then lay out the tape measure on the ice with one end at the
bear’s original position, as shown in Figure 9.26. Grab hold
of the free end of the rope and position yourself as shown,

noting your location. Take off your spiked shoes and pull on
the rope hand over hand. Both you and the bear will slide
over the ice until you meet. From the tape, observe how far
you have slid, xp , and how far the bear has slid, xb . The point
where you meet the bear is the constant location of the center of mass of the system (bear plus you), and so you can determine the mass of the bear from m b x b  m p x p . (Unfortunately, you cannot get back to your spiked shoes and so are in
big trouble if the bear wakes up!)

Motion

the center of mass of the system made up of all the fragments
after the explosion?

Solution Neglecting air resistance, the only external force
on the projectile is the gravitational force. Thus, if the projectile did not explode, it would continue to move along the
parabolic path indicated by the broken line in Figure 9.27.
Because the forces caused by the explosion are internal, they
do not affect the motion of the center of mass. Thus, after
the explosion the center of mass of the system (the fragments) follows the same parabolic path the projectile would
have followed if there had been no explosion.

Figure 9.27 When a projectile explodes into several fragments,
the center of mass of the system made up of all the fragments follows
the same parabolic path the projectile would have taken had there
been no explosion.

EXAMPLE 9.17

The Exploding Rocket

A rocket is ﬁred vertically upward. At the instant it reaches an
altitude of 1 000 m and a speed of 300 m/s, it explodes into
three equal fragments. One fragment continues to move upward with a speed of 450 m/s following the explosion. The
second fragment has a speed of 240 m/s and is moving east
right after the explosion. What is the velocity of the third
fragment right after the explosion?

Solution Let us call the total mass of the rocket M; hence,
the mass of each fragment is M/3. Because the forces of the
explosion are internal to the system and cannot affect its total
momentum, the total momentum pi of the rocket just before
the explosion must equal the total momentum pf of the fragments right after the explosion.

ROCKET PROPULSION

When ordinary vehicles, such as automobiles and locomotives, are propelled, the
driving force for the motion is friction. In the case of the automobile, the driving
force is the force exerted by the road on the car. A locomotive “pushes” against the
tracks; hence, the driving force is the force exerted by the tracks on the locomotive. However, a rocket moving in space has no road or tracks to push against.
Therefore, the source of the propulsion of a rocket must be something other than
friction. Figure 9.28 is a dramatic photograph of a spacecraft at liftoff. The operation of a rocket depends upon the law of conservation of linear momentum
as applied to a system of particles, where the system is the rocket plus its
ejected fuel.
Rocket propulsion can be understood by ﬁrst considering the mechanical system consisting of a machine gun mounted on a cart on wheels. As the gun is ﬁred,

Figure 9.28 Liftoff of the space shuttle
Columbia. Enormous thrust is generated
by the shuttle’s liquid-fuel engines, aided
by the two solid-fuel boosters. Many physical principles from mechanics, thermodynamics, and electricity and magnetism are
involved in such a launch.

Linear Momentum and Collisions

each bullet receives a momentum mv in some direction, where v is measured with
respect to a stationary Earth frame. The momentum of the system made up of cart,
gun, and bullets must be conserved. Hence, for each bullet ﬁred, the gun and cart
must receive a compensating momentum in the opposite direction. That is, the reaction force exerted by the bullet on the gun accelerates the cart and gun, and the
cart moves in the direction opposite that of the bullets. If n is the number of bullets ﬁred each second, then the average force exerted on the gun is Fav  nmv.
In a similar manner, as a rocket moves in free space, its linear momentum
changes when some of its mass is released in the form of ejected gases. Because
the gases are given momentum when they are ejected out of the engine, the
rocket receives a compensating momentum in the opposite direction. Therefore, the rocket is accelerated as a result of the “push,” or thrust, from the exhaust
gases. In free space, the center of mass of the system (rocket plus expelled gases)
moves uniformly, independent of the propulsion process.5
Suppose that at some time t, the magnitude of the momentum of a rocket plus
its fuel is (M  m)v, where v is the speed of the rocket relative to the Earth (Fig.
9.29a). Over a short time interval t, the rocket ejects fuel of mass m, and so at
the end of this interval the rocket’s speed is v  v, where v is the change in
speed of the rocket (Fig. 9.29b). If the fuel is ejected with a speed ve relative to the
rocket (the subscript “e” stands for exhaust, and ve is usually called the exhaust
speed), the velocity of the fuel relative to a stationary frame of reference is v  ve .
Thus, if we equate the total initial momentum of the system to the total ﬁnal momentum, we obtain
(M  m)v  M(v  v)  m(v  ve)

pi = (M + ∆m)v

where M represents the mass of the rocket and its remaining fuel after an amount
of fuel having mass m has been ejected. Simplifying this expression gives

(a) The initial mass of the rocket
plus all its fuel is M  m at a time
t, and its speed is v. (b) At a time t
 t, the rocket’s mass has been reduced to M and an amount of fuel
m has been ejected. The rocket’s
speed increases by an amount v.

We also could have arrived at this result by considering the system in the center-of-mass frame of reference, which is a frame having the same velocity as the
center of mass of the system. In this frame, the total momentum of the system is
zero; therefore, if the rocket gains a momentum M v by ejecting some fuel, the
exhausted fuel obtains a momentum ve m in the opposite direction, so that M v 
ve m  0. If we now take the limit as t goes to zero, we get v : dv and
m : dm. Futhermore, the increase in the exhaust mass dm corresponds to an
equal decrease in the rocket mass, so that dm  dM. Note that dM is given a negative sign because it represents a decrease in mass. Using this fact, we obtain
M dv  ve dm  ve dM

9.8

279

Rocket Propulsion

This is the basic expression of rocket propulsion. First, it tells us that the increase in
rocket speed is proportional to the exhaust speed of the ejected gases, ve . Therefore,
the exhaust speed should be very high. Second, the increase in rocket speed is proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio Mi /Mf . Therefore, this ratio should
be as large as possible, which means that the mass of the rocket without its fuel
should be as small as possible and the rocket should carry as much fuel as possible.
The thrust on the rocket is the force exerted on it by the ejected exhaust
gases. We can obtain an expression for the thrust from Equation 9.40:

Solution The water is exiting at 3 600 L/min, which is
60 L/s. Knowing that 1 L of water has a mass of 1 kg, we can
say that about 60 kg of water leaves the nozzle every second.
As the water leaves the hose, it exerts on the hose a thrust
that must be counteracted by the 600-N force exerted on the
hose by the ﬁreﬁghters. So, applying Equation 9.42 gives

Linear Momentum and Collisions

SUMMARY
The linear momentum p of a particle of mass m moving with a velocity v is
p ⬅ mv

(9.1)

The law of conservation of linear momentum indicates that the total momentum of an isolated system is conserved. If two particles form an isolated system, their total momentum is conserved regardless of the nature of the force between them. Therefore, the total momentum of the system at all times equals its
initial total momentum, or
p1i  p2i  p1f  p2f

This is known as the impulse – momentum theorem.
Impulsive forces are often very strong compared with other forces on the system and usually act for a very short time, as in the case of collisions.
When two particles collide, the total momentum of the system before the collision always equals the total momentum after the collision, regardless of the nature
of the collision. An inelastic collision is one for which the total kinetic energy is
not conserved. A perfectly inelastic collision is one in which the colliding bodies
stick together after the collision. An elastic collision is one in which kinetic energy is constant.
In a two- or three-dimensional collision, the components of momentum in
each of the three directions (x, y, and z) are conserved independently.

26. On the subject of the following positions, state your own
view and argue to support it: (a) The best theory of motion is that force causes acceleration. (b) The true measure of a force’s effectiveness is the work it does, and the
best theory of motion is that work on an object changes
its energy. (c) The true measure of a force’s effect is impulse, and the best theory of motion is that impulse
injected into an object changes its momentum.

the work – kinetic energy theorem, stating that the total
work on an object causes its change in kinetic energy;
and the impulse – momentum theorem, stating that the
total impulse on an object causes its change in momentum. In this problem, you compare predictions of the

and carry out a computer analysis of the motion according to Euler’s method. Find (a) the ﬁnal velocity of the

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
9.1 (d). Two identical objects (m1  m 2 ) traveling in the
same direction at the same speed (v1  v 2 ) have the
same kinetic energies and the same momenta. However,
this is not true if the two objects are moving at the same
speed but in different directions. In the latter case, K1 
K 2 , but the differing velocity directions indicate that
p 1  p 2 because momentum is a vector quantity.
It also is possible for particular combinations of
masses and velocities to satisfy K1  K 2 but not p 1  p 2 .
For example, a 1-kg object moving at 2 m/s has the
same kinetic energy as a 4-kg object moving at 1 m/s,
but the two clearly do not have the same momenta.
9.2 (b), (c), (a). The slower the ball, the easier it is to catch.
If the momentum of the medicine ball is the same as the
momentum of the baseball, the speed of the medicine
ball must be 1/10 the speed of the baseball because the
medicine ball has 10 times the mass. If the kinetic energies are the same, the speed of the medicine ball must
be 1/√10 the speed of the baseball because of the
squared speed term in the formula for K. The medicine

ball is hardest to catch when it has the same speed as the
baseball.
9.3 (c) and (e). Object 2 has a greater acceleration because
of its smaller mass. Therefore, it takes less time to travel
the distance d. Thus, even though the force applied to
objects 1 and 2 is the same, the change in momentum is
less for object 2 because t is smaller. Therefore, because the initial momenta were the same (both zero),
p 1  p 2 . The work W  Fd done on both objects is the
same because both F and d are the same in the two
cases. Therefore, K1  K 2 .
9.4 Because the passenger is brought from the car’s initial
speed to a full stop, the change in momentum (the impulse) is the same regardless of whether the passenger is
stopped by dashboard, seatbelt, or airbag. However, the
dashboard stops the passenger very quickly in a frontend collision. The seatbelt takes somewhat more time.
Used along with the seatbelt, the airbag can extend the
passenger’s stopping time further, notably for his head,
which would otherwise snap forward. Therefore, the

Problems
dashboard applies the greatest force, the seatbelt an intermediate force, and the airbag the least force. Airbags
are designed to work in conjunction with seatbelts.
Make sure you wear your seatbelt at all times while in a
moving vehicle.
9.5 If we deﬁne the ball as our system, momentum is not
conserved. The ball’s speed — and hence its momentum — continually increase. This is consistent with the
fact that the gravitational force is external to this chosen system. However, if we deﬁne our system as the ball
and the Earth, momentum is conserved, for the Earth
also has momentum because the ball exerts a gravitational force on it. As the ball falls, the Earth moves up
to meet it (although the Earth’s speed is on the order
of 1025 times less than that of the ball!). This upward
movement changes the Earth’s momentum. The
change in the Earth’s momentum is numerically equal
to the change in the ball’s momentum but is in the opposite direction. Therefore, the total momentum of the
Earth–ball system is conserved. Because the Earth’s
mass is so great, its upward motion is negligibly small.
9.6 (c). The greatest impulse (greatest change in momentum) is imparted to the Frisbee when the skater reverses
its momentum vector by catching it and throwing it
back. Since this is when the skater imparts the greatest
impulse to the Frisbee, then this also is when the Frisbee
imparts the greatest impulse to her.
9.7 Both are equally bad. Imagine watching the collision
from a safer location alongside the road. As the “crush
zones” of the two cars are compressed, you will see that

291

the actual point of contact is stationary. You would see
the same thing if your car were to collide with a solid
wall.
9.8 No, such movement can never occur if we assume the
collisions are elastic. The momentum of the system before the collision is mv, where m is the mass of ball 1 and
v is its speed just before the collision. After the collision,
we would have two balls, each of mass m and moving
with a speed of v/2. Thus, the total momentum of the
system after the collision would be m(v/2)  m(v/2) 
mv. Thus, momentum is conserved. However, the kinetic
energy just before the collision is K i  12 mv 2, and that
after the collision is K f  12 m(v/2)2  12 m(v/2)2  14mv 2.
Thus, kinetic energy is not conserved. Both momentum
and kinetic energy are conserved only when one ball
moves out when one ball is released, two balls move out
when two are released, and so on.
9.9 No they will not! The piece with the handle will have less
mass than the piece made up of the end of the bat. To
see why this is so, take the origin of coordinates as the
center of mass before the bat was cut. Replace each cut
piece by a small sphere located at the center of mass for
each piece. The sphere representing the handle piece is
farther from the origin, but the product of lesser mass
and greater distance balances the product of greater
mass and lesser distance for the end piece:

hen an extended object, such as a wheel, rotates about its axis, the motion
cannot be analyzed by treating the object as a particle because at any given
time different parts of the object have different linear velocities and linear
accelerations. For this reason, it is convenient to consider an extended object as a
large number of particles, each of which has its own linear velocity and linear
acceleration.
In dealing with a rotating object, analysis is greatly simpliﬁed by assuming that
the object is rigid. A rigid object is one that is nondeformable — that is, it is an
object in which the separations between all pairs of particles remain constant. All
real bodies are deformable to some extent; however, our rigid-object model is useful in many situations in which deformation is negligible.
In this chapter, we treat the rotation of a rigid object about a ﬁxed axis, which
is commonly referred to as pure rotational motion.

ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT, VELOCITY,
AND ACCELERATION

Figure 10.1 illustrates a planar (ﬂat), rigid object of arbitrary shape conﬁned to
the xy plane and rotating about a ﬁxed axis through O. The axis is perpendicular
to the plane of the ﬁgure, and O is the origin of an xy coordinate system. Let us
look at the motion of only one of the millions of “particles” making up this object.
A particle at P is at a ﬁxed distance r from the origin and rotates about it in a circle
of radius r. (In fact, every particle on the object undergoes circular motion about
O.) It is convenient to represent the position of P with its polar coordinates (r, ),
where r is the distance from the origin to P and  is measured counterclockwise from
some preferred direction — in this case, the positive x axis. In this representation,
the only coordinate that changes in time is the angle  ; r remains constant. (In
cartesian coordinates, both x and y vary in time.) As the particle moves along the
circle from the positive x axis (  0) to P, it moves through an arc of length s,
which is related to the angular position  through the relationship

Because the circumference of a circle is 2r, it follows from Equation 10.1b that
360° corresponds to an angle of 2r/r rad  2 rad (one revolution). Hence,
1 rad  360°/2 ⬇ 57.3°. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians,
we use the fact that 2 rad  360°:

For example, 60° equals /3 rad, and 45° equals /4 rad.

perpendicular to the plane of the
ﬁgure. (In other words, the axis of
rotation is the z axis.) A particle at
P rotates in a circle of radius r centered at O.

It is important to note the units of  in Equation 10.1b. Because  is the ratio
of an arc length and the radius of the circle, it is a pure number. However, we commonly give  the artiﬁcial unit radian (rad), where
one radian is the angle subtended by an arc length equal to the radius of the
arc.

motion).

Angular acceleration has units of radians per second squared (rad/s2 ), or just second2 (s2 ). Note that  is positive when the rate of counterclockwise rotation is
increasing or when the rate of clockwise rotation is decreasing.
When rotating about a ﬁxed axis, every particle on a rigid object rotates
through the same angle and has the same angular speed and the same angular acceleration. That is, the quantities , , and  characterize the rotational
motion of the entire rigid object. Using these quantities, we can greatly simplify
the analysis of rigid-body rotation.
Angular position (), angular speed (), and angular acceleration () are
analogous to linear position (x), linear speed (v), and linear acceleration (a). The
variables , , and  differ dimensionally from the variables x, v, and a only by a
factor having the unit of length.
We have not speciﬁed any direction for  and . Strictly speaking, these
variables are the magnitudes of the angular velocity and the angular acceleration vectors ␻ and ␣, respectively, and they should always be positive. Because
we are considering rotation about a ﬁxed axis, however, we can indicate the directions of the vectors by assigning a positive or negative sign to  and , as discussed earlier with regard to Equations 10.4 and 10.6. For rotation about a ﬁxed
axis, the only direction that uniquely speciﬁes the rotational motion is the direction along the axis of rotation. Therefore, the directions of ␻ and ␣ are
along this axis. If an object rotates in the xy plane as in Figure 10.1, the direction of ␻ is out of the plane of the diagram when the rotation is counterclockwise and into the plane of the diagram when the rotation is clockwise. To illustrate this convention, it is convenient to use the right-hand rule demonstrated in
Figure 10.3. When the four ﬁngers of the right hand are wrapped in the direction of rotation, the extended right thumb points in the direction of ␻. The direction of ␣ follows from its deﬁnition d␻/dt. It is the same as the direction of
␻ if the angular speed is increasing in time, and it is antiparallel to ␻ if the angular speed is decreasing in time.

ROTATIONAL KINEMATICS: ROTATIONAL MOTION
WITH CONSTANT ANGULAR ACCELERATION

In our study of linear motion, we found that the simplest form of accelerated motion to analyze is motion under constant linear acceleration. Likewise, for rotational motion about a ﬁxed axis, the simplest accelerated motion to analyze is motion under constant angular acceleration. Therefore, we next develop kinematic
relationships for this type of motion. If we write Equation 10.6 in the form d 

ANGULAR AND LINEAR QUANTITIES

In this section we derive some useful relationships between the angular speed and
acceleration of a rotating rigid object and the linear speed and acceleration of an
arbitrary point in the object. To do so, we must keep in mind that when a rigid object rotates about a ﬁxed axis, as in Figure 10.4, every particle of the object moves
in a circle whose center is the axis of rotation.
We can relate the angular speed of the rotating object to the tangential speed
of a point P on the object. Because point P moves in a circle, the linear velocity
vector v is always tangent to the circular path and hence is called tangential velocity.
The magnitude of the tangential velocity of the point P is by deﬁnition the tangential speed v  ds/dt, where s is the distance traveled by this point measured along
the circular path. Recalling that s  r  (Eq. 10.1a) and noting that r is constant,
we obtain
v

Figure 10.4 As a rigid object rotates about the ﬁxed axis through
O, the point P has a linear velocity
v that is always tangent to the circular path of radius r.

Because d/dt   (see Eq. 10.4), we can say
v  r

(10.10)

That is, the tangential speed of a point on a rotating rigid object equals the perpendicular distance of that point from the axis of rotation multiplied by the angular speed. Therefore, although every point on the rigid object has the same angular speed, not every point has the same linear speed because r is not the same for
all points on the object. Equation 10.10 shows that the linear speed of a point on
the rotating object increases as one moves outward from the center of rotation, as
we would intuitively expect. The outer end of a swinging baseball bat moves much
faster than the handle.
We can relate the angular acceleration of the rotating rigid object to the tangential acceleration of the point P by taking the time derivative of v:

the angular acceleration.

CHAPTER 10

Rotation of a Rigid Object About a Fixed Axis

In Section 4.4 we found that a point rotating in a circular path undergoes a
centripetal, or radial, acceleration ar of magnitude v 2/r directed toward the center
of rotation (Fig. 10.5). Because v  r for a point P on a rotating object, we can

The total linear acceleration vector of the point is a  at ar . (at describes
the change in how fast the point is moving, and ar represents the change in its direction of travel.) Because a is a vector having a radial and a tangential component, the magnitude of a for the point P on the rotating rigid object is

CD Player

On a compact disc, audio information is stored in a series of
pits and ﬂat areas on the surface of the disc. The information
is stored digitally, and the alternations between pits and ﬂat
areas on the surface represent binary ones and zeroes to be
read by the compact disc player and converted back to sound
waves. The pits and ﬂat areas are detected by a system consisting of a laser and lenses. The length of a certain number of
ones and zeroes is the same everywhere on the disc, whether
the information is near the center of the disc or near its
outer edge. In order that this length of ones and zeroes always passes by the laser – lens system in the same time period,
the linear speed of the disc surface at the location of the lens
must be constant. This requires, according to Equation 10.10,
that the angular speed vary as the laser – lens system moves radially along the disc. In a typical compact disc player, the disc
spins counterclockwise (Fig. 10.6), and the constant speed of
the surface at the point of the laser – lens system is 1.3 m/s.
(a) Find the angular speed of the disc in revolutions per
minute when information is being read from the innermost
ﬁrst track (r  23 mm) and the outermost ﬁnal track (r 

The player adjusts the angular speed  of the disc within this
range so that information moves past the objective lens at a

(b) The maximum playing time of a standard music CD
is 74 minutes and 33 seconds. How many revolutions does the

Solution We know that the angular speed is always decreasing, and we assume that it is decreasing steadily, with 
constant. The time interval t is (74 min)(60 s/min)
33 s  4 473 s. We are looking for the angular position f ,
where we set the initial angular position i  0. We can use

Solution We have several choices for approaching this
problem. Let us use the most direct approach by utilizing
Equation 10.5, which is based on the deﬁnition of the term
we are seeking. We should obtain a negative number for the
angular acceleration because the disc spins more and more
slowly in the positive direction as time goes on. Our answer
should also be fairly small because it takes such a long time —
more than an hour — for the change in angular speed to be
accomplished:

ROTATIONAL ENERGY

Let us now look at the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid object, considering the object as a collection of particles and assuming it rotates about a ﬁxed z axis with an
angular speed  (Fig. 10.7). Each particle has kinetic energy determined by its
mass and linear speed. If the mass of the ith particle is mi and its linear speed is vi ,
its kinetic energy is

To proceed further, we must recall that although every particle in the rigid object
has the same angular speed , the individual linear speeds depend on the distance
ri from the axis of rotation according to the expression vi  ri  (see Eq. 10.10).

Rotational kinetic energy

(10.16)

Although we commonly refer to the quantity 21I 2 as rotational kinetic energy,
it is not a new form of energy. It is ordinary kinetic energy because it is derived
from a sum over individual kinetic energies of the particles contained in the rigid
object. However, the mathematical form of the kinetic energy given by Equation
10.16 is a convenient one when we are dealing with rotational motion, provided
we know how to calculate I.
It is important that you recognize the analogy between kinetic energy associated with linear motion 12mv 2 and rotational kinetic energy 12 I 2. The quantities I
and  in rotational motion are analogous to m and v in linear motion, respectively.
(In fact, I takes the place of m every time we compare a linear-motion equation
with its rotational counterpart.) The moment of inertia is a measure of the resistance of an object to changes in its rotational motion, just as mass is a measure of
the tendency of an object to resist changes in its linear motion. Note, however,
that mass is an intrinsic property of an object, whereas I depends on the physical
arrangement of that mass. Can you think of a situation in which an object’s moment of inertia changes even though its mass does not?

This is a very small number, consistent with the minuscule

10.5 Calculation of Moments of Inertia

EXAMPLE 10.4

Four Rotating Masses

Four tiny spheres are fastened to the corners of a frame of
negligible mass lying in the xy plane (Fig. 10.8). We shall assume that the spheres’ radii are small compared with the dimensions of the frame. (a) If the system rotates about the y
axis with an angular speed , ﬁnd the moment of inertia and
the rotational kinetic energy about this axis.

Solution

First, note that the two spheres of mass m, which
lie on the y axis, do not contribute to Iy (that is, ri  0 for
these spheres about this axis). Applying Equation 10.15, we
obtain
Iy 

m i ri 2  Ma 2

Therefore, the rotational kinetic energy about the y axis is
K R  12Iy  2  12(2Ma 2) 2  Ma 2 2
The fact that the two spheres of mass m do not enter into this
result makes sense because they have no motion about the
axis of rotation; hence, they have no rotational kinetic energy. By similar logic, we expect the moment of inertia about
the x axis to be Ix  2mb 2 with a rotational kinetic energy
about that axis of K R  mb 2 2.
(b) Suppose the system rotates in the xy plane about an
axis through O (the z axis). Calculate the moment of inertia
and rotational kinetic energy about this axis.

The four spheres are at a ﬁxed separation as shown.
The moment of inertia of the system depends on the axis about
which it is evaluated.

Comparing the results for parts (a) and (b), we conclude
that the moment of inertia and therefore the rotational kinetic energy associated with a given angular speed depend on
the axis of rotation. In part (b), we expect the result to include all four spheres and distances because all four spheres
are rotating in the xy plane. Furthermore, the fact that the rotational kinetic energy in part (a) is smaller than that in part
(b) indicates that it would take less effort (work) to set the
system into rotation about the y axis than about the z axis.

CALCULATION OF MOMENTS OF INERTIA

We can evaluate the moment of inertia of an extended rigid object by imagining
the object divided into many small volume elements, each of which has mass m.
We use the deﬁnition I  r i 2 m i and take the limit of this sum as m : 0. In
i
this limit, the sum becomes an integral over the whole object:

It is usually easier to calculate moments of inertia in terms of the volume of
the elements rather than their mass, and we can easily make that change by using
Equation 1.1,  m/V, where is the density of the object and V is its volume. We
want this expression in its differential form  dm/dV because the volumes we
are dealing with are very small. Solving for dm  dV and substituting the result

If the object is homogeneous, then is constant and the integral can be evaluated
for a known geometry. If is not constant, then its variation with position must be
known to complete the integration.
The density given by  m/V sometimes is referred to as volume density for the
obvious reason that it relates to volume. Often we use other ways of expressing
density. For instance, when dealing with a sheet of uniform thickness t, we can deﬁne a surface density   t, which signiﬁes mass per unit area. Finally, when mass is
distributed along a uniform rod of cross-sectional area A, we sometimes use linear
density   M/L  A, which is the mass per unit length.

Uniform Solid Cylinder

A uniform solid cylinder has a radius R, mass M, and length
L. Calculate its moment of inertia about its central axis (the z
axis in Fig. 10.11).

Solution

It is convenient to divide the cylinder into many
z

cylindrical shells, each of which has radius r, thickness dr, and
length L, as shown in Figure 10.11. The volume dV of each
shell is its cross-sectional area multiplied by its length: dV 
dA L  (2 r dr)L. If the mass per unit volume is , then the
mass of this differential volume element is dm  dV 
2 rL dr. Substituting this expression for dm into Equation

Note that this result does not depend on L, the length of the
cylinder. In other words, it applies equally well to a long cylinder and a ﬂat disc. Also note that this is exactly half the value
we would expect were all the mass concentrated at the outer
edge of the cylinder or disc. (See Example 10.5.)

Table 10.2 gives the moments of inertia for a number of bodies about speciﬁc
axes. The moments of inertia of rigid bodies with simple geometry (high symmetry) are relatively easy to calculate provided the rotation axis coincides with an axis
of symmetry. The calculation of moments of inertia about an arbitrary axis can be
cumbersome, however, even for a highly symmetric object. Fortunately, use of an
important theorem, called the parallel-axis theorem, often simpliﬁes the calculation. Suppose the moment of inertia about an axis through the center of mass of
an object is ICM . The parallel-axis theorem states that the moment of inertia about
any axis parallel to and a distance D away from this axis is

Proof of the Parallel-Axis Theorem (Optional). Suppose that an object rotates
in the xy plane about the z axis, as shown in Figure 10.12, and that the coordinates
of the center of mass are x CM , y CM . Let the mass element dm have coordinates x, y.
Because this element is a distance r  √x 2 y 2 from the z axis, the moment of inertia about the z axis is

the original coordinate system centered on O, then from Figure 10.12a we see that
the relationships between the unprimed and primed coordinates are x  x x CM

Applying the Parallel-Axis Theorem

Consider once again the uniform rigid rod of mass M and
length L shown in Figure 10.10. Find the moment of inertia
of the rod about an axis perpendicular to the rod through
one end (the yaxis in Fig. 10.10).

Solution Intuitively, we expect the moment of inertia to
1
be greater than ICM  12
ML 2 because it should be more difﬁcult to change the rotational motion of a rod spinning about
an axis at one end than one that is spinning about its center.
Because the distance between the center-of-mass axis and the
y axis is D  L/2, the parallel-axis theorem gives

Rotation of a Rigid Object About a Fixed Axis

TORQUE

Why are a door’s doorknob and hinges placed near opposite edges of the door?
This question actually has an answer based on common sense ideas. The harder
we push against the door and the farther we are from the hinges, the more likely
we are to open or close the door. When a force is exerted on a rigid object pivoted
about an axis, the object tends to rotate about that axis. The tendency of a force to
rotate an object about some axis is measured by a vector quantity called torque ␶
(tau).
Consider the wrench pivoted on the axis through O in Figure 10.13. The applied force F acts at an angle  to the horizontal. We deﬁne the magnitude of the
torque associated with the force F by the expression

 ⬅ r F sin   Fd

Deﬁnition of torque

Moment arm

(10.19)

where r is the distance between the pivot point and the point of application of F
and d is the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of F.
(The line of action of a force is an imaginary line extending out both ends of the
vector representing the force. The dashed line extending from the tail of F in Figure 10.13 is part of the line of action of F.) From the right triangle in Figure 10.13
that has the wrench as its hypotenuse, we see that d  r sin . This quantity d is
called the moment arm (or lever arm) of F.
It is very important that you recognize that torque is deﬁned only when a reference
axis is speciﬁed. Torque is the product of a force and the moment arm of that force,
and moment arm is deﬁned only in terms of an axis of rotation.
In Figure 10.13, the only component of F that tends to cause rotation is F sin ,
the component perpendicular to r. The horizontal component F cos , because it
passes through O, has no tendency to produce rotation. From the deﬁnition of
torque, we see that the rotating tendency increases as F increases and as d increases. This explains the observation that it is easier to close a door if we push at
the doorknob rather than at a point close to the hinge. We also want to apply our
push as close to perpendicular to the door as we can. Pushing sideways on the
doorknob will not cause the door to rotate.
If two or more forces are acting on a rigid object, as shown in Figure 10.14,
each tends to produce rotation about the pivot at O. In this example, F2 tends to

wrench about O.

10.7 Relationship Between Torque and Angular Acceleration

rotate the object clockwise, and F1 tends to rotate it counterclockwise. We use the
convention that the sign of the torque resulting from a force is positive if the turning tendency of the force is counterclockwise and is negative if the turning tendency is clockwise. For example, in Figure 10.14, the torque resulting from F1 ,
which has a moment arm d 1 , is positive and equal to F1 d 1 ; the torque from F2 is
negative and equal to  F2 d 2 . Hence, the net torque about O is

  1

2  F 1d 1  F 2d 2

Torque should not be confused with force. Forces can cause a change in linear motion, as described by Newton’s second law. Forces can also cause a change
in rotational motion, but the effectiveness of the forces in causing this change depends on both the forces and the moment arms of the forces, in the combination
that we call torque. Torque has units of force times length — newton meters in SI
units — and should be reported in these units. Do not confuse torque and work,
which have the same units but are very different concepts.

EXAMPLE 10.9

The Net Torque on a Cylinder

A one-piece cylinder is shaped as shown in Figure 10.15, with
a core section protruding from the larger drum. The cylinder
is free to rotate around the central axis shown in the drawing.
A rope wrapped around the drum, which has radius R 1 , exerts a force F1 to the right on the cylinder. A rope wrapped
around the core, which has radius R 2 , exerts a force F2 downward on the cylinder. (a) What is the net torque acting on the
cylinder about the rotation axis (which is the z axis in Figure
10.15)?

We can make a quick check by noting that if the two forces
are of equal magnitude, the net torque is negative because
R 1  R 2 . Starting from rest with both forces acting on it, the
cylinder would rotate clockwise because F 1 would be more effective at turning it than would F 2 .
(b) Suppose F 1  5.0 N, R 1  1.0 m, F 2  15.0 N, and
R 2  0.50 m. What is the net torque about the rotation axis,
and which way does the cylinder rotate from rest?

x

z

Figure 10.15

Solution The torque due to F1 is  R 1 F1 (the sign is negative because the torque tends to produce clockwise rotation).
The torque due to F2 is R 2 F 2 (the sign is positive because
the torque tends to produce counterclockwise rotation).
Therefore, the net torque about the rotation axis is

  (5.0 N)(1.0 m)

(15.0 N)(0.50 m)  2.5 N m

Because the net torque is positive, if the cylinder starts from
rest, it will commence rotating counterclockwise with increasing angular velocity. (If the cylinder’s initial rotation is clockwise, it will slow to a stop and then rotate counterclockwise
with increasing angular speed.)

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TORQUE AND
ANGULAR ACCELERATION

In this section we show that the angular acceleration of a rigid object rotating
about a ﬁxed axis is proportional to the net torque acting about that axis. Before
discussing the more complex case of rigid-body rotation, however, it is instructive

308

CHAPTER 10

Rotation of a Rigid Object About a Fixed Axis

ﬁrst to discuss the case of a particle rotating about some ﬁxed point under the inﬂuence of an external force.
Consider a particle of mass m rotating in a circle of radius r under the inﬂuence of a tangential force Ft and a radial force Fr , as shown in Figure 10.16. (As we
learned in Chapter 6, the radial force must be present to keep the particle moving
in its circular path.) The tangential force provides a tangential acceleration at , and
Ft  ma t
The torque about the center of the circle due to Ft is

  F t r  (ma t )r

Figure 10.16

A particle rotating
in a circle under the inﬂuence of a
tangential force Ft . A force Fr in
the radial direction also must be
present to maintain the circular
motion.

Because the tangential acceleration is related to the angular acceleration through
the relationship at  r (see Eq. 10.11), the torque can be expressed as

  (mr )r  (mr 2)
Recall from Equation 10.15 that mr 2 is the moment of inertia of the rotating particle about the z axis passing through the origin, so that

  I

Relationship between torque and
angular acceleration

(10.20)

That is, the torque acting on the particle is proportional to its angular acceleration, and the proportionality constant is the moment of inertia. It is important
to note that   I is the rotational analog of Newton’s second law of motion,
F  ma.
Now let us extend this discussion to a rigid object of arbitrary shape rotating
about a ﬁxed axis, as shown in Figure 10.17. The object can be regarded as an inﬁnite number of mass elements dm of inﬁnitesimal size. If we impose a cartesian coordinate system on the object, then each mass element rotates in a circle about the
origin, and each has a tangential acceleration at produced by an external tangential force dFt . For any given element, we know from Newton’s second law that

d Ft

The torque d associated with the force dFt acts about the origin and is given by

r
O

d   r dF t  (r dm)a t
Because at  r , the expression for d becomes

Figure 10.17

A rigid object rotating about an axis through O.
Each mass element dm rotates
about O with the same angular acceleration , and the net torque on
the object is proportional to .

d   (r dm)r   (r 2 dm)
It is important to recognize that although each mass element of the rigid object may have a different linear acceleration at , they all have the same angular acceleration . With this in mind, we can integrate the above expression to obtain
the net torque about O due to the external forces:



冕

(r 2 dm)  

冕

r 2 dm

where  can be taken outside the integral because it is common to all mass elements. From Equation 10.17, we know that 冕 r 2 dm is the moment of inertia of the
object about the rotation axis through O, and so the expression for  becomes
Torque is proportional to angular
acceleration

  I

(10.21)

Note that this is the same relationship we found for a particle rotating in a circle
(see Eq. 10.20). So, again we see that the net torque about the rotation axis is pro-

309

10.7 Relationship Between Torque and Angular Acceleration

portional to the angular acceleration of the object, with the proportionality factor
being I, a quantity that depends upon the axis of rotation and upon the size and
shape of the object. In view of the complex nature of the system, it is interesting to
note that the relationship   I is strikingly simple and in complete agreement
with experimental observations. The simplicity of the result lies in the manner in
which the motion is described.

Every point has the same  and 

Although each point on a rigid object rotating about a ﬁxed axis may not experience the same force, linear acceleration, or linear speed, each point experiences the same angular acceleration and angular speed at any instant. Therefore, at any instant the rotating rigid object as a whole is characterized by
speciﬁc values for angular acceleration, net torque, and angular speed.

QuickLab

Finally, note that the result   I also applies when the forces acting on the
mass elements have radial components as well as tangential components. This is
because the line of action of all radial components must pass through the axis of
rotation, and hence all radial components produce zero torque about that axis.

EXAMPLE 10.10

Tip over a child’s tall tower of blocks.
Try this several times. Does the tower
“break” at the same place each time?
What affects where the tower comes
apart as it tips? If the tower were
made of toy bricks that snap together,
what would happen? (Refer to Conceptual Example 10.11.)

Rotating Rod

A uniform rod of length L and mass M is attached at one end
to a frictionless pivot and is free to rotate about the pivot in
the vertical plane, as shown in Figure 10.18. The rod is released from rest in the horizontal position. What is the initial
angular acceleration of the rod and the initial linear acceleration of its right end?

compute the torque on the rod, we can assume that the gravitational force acts at the center of mass of the rod, as shown
in Figure 10.18. The torque due to this force about an axis
through the pivot is

We cannot use our kinematic equations to ﬁnd 
or a because the torque exerted on the rod varies with its position, and so neither acceleration is constant. We have
enough information to ﬁnd the torque, however, which we
can then use in the torque – angular acceleration relationship
(Eq. 10.21) to ﬁnd  and then a.
The only force contributing to torque about an axis
through the pivot is the gravitational force Mg exerted on
the rod. (The force exerted by the pivot on the rod has zero
torque about the pivot because its moment arm is zero.) To

With   I, and I  13 ML 2 for this axis of rotation (see

This result — that at  g for the free end of the rod — is
rather interesting. It means that if we place a coin at the tip
of the rod, hold the rod in the horizontal position, and then
release the rod, the tip of the rod falls faster than the coin
does!
Other points on the rod have a linear acceleration that
is less than 32 g. For example, the middle of the rod has
an acceleration of 34 g.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10.11

Rotation of a Rigid Object About a Fixed Axis

Falling Smokestacks and Tumbling Blocks

When a tall smokestack falls over, it often breaks somewhere
along its length before it hits the ground, as shown in Figure
10.19. The same thing happens with a tall tower of children’s
toy blocks. Why does this happen?

Solution As the smokestack rotates around its base, each
higher portion of the smokestack falls with an increasing
tangential acceleration. (The tangential acceleration of a
given point on the smokestack is proportional to the distance of that portion from the base.) As the acceleration increases, higher portions of the smokestack experience an
acceleration greater than that which could result from
gravity alone; this is similar to the situation described in
Example 10.10. This can happen only if these portions are
being pulled downward by a force in addition to the gravitational force. The force that causes this to occur is the
shear force from lower portions of the smokestack. Eventually the shear force that provides this acceleration is greater
than the smokestack can withstand, and the smokestack
breaks.

Angular Acceleration of a Wheel

10.20. A light cord wrapped around the wheel supports an
object of mass m. Calculate the angular acceleration of the
wheel, the linear acceleration of the object, and the tension
in the cord.

Solution The torque acting on the wheel about its axis
of rotation is   TR, where T is the force exerted by the
cord on the rim of the wheel. (The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the wheel and the normal force exerted by the axle on the wheel both pass through the axis
of rotation and thus produce no torque.) Because   I,

WORK, POWER, AND ENERGY
IN ROTATIONAL MOTION

In this section, we consider the relationship between the torque acting on a rigid
object and its resulting rotational motion in order to generate expressions for the
power and a rotational analog to the work – kinetic energy theorem. Consider the
rigid object pivoted at O in Figure 10.22. Suppose a single external force F is applied at P, where F lies in the plane of the page. The work done by F as the object
rotates through an inﬁnitesimal distance ds  r d in a time dt is
dW  Fⴢds  (F sin )r d 
where F sin  is the tangential component of F, or, in other words, the component
of the force along the displacement. Note that the radial component of F does no work
because it is perpendicular to the displacement.
Because the magnitude of the torque due to F about O is deﬁned as rF sin 
by Equation 10.19, we can write the work done for the inﬁnitesimal rotation as
dW   d 

(10.22)

The rate at which work is being done by F as the object rotates about the ﬁxed axis is

Because dW/dt is the instantaneous power ᏼ (see Section 7.5) delivered by the

This expression is analogous to ᏼ  Fv in the case of linear motion, and the expression dW   d is analogous to dW  Fx dx.

Work and Energy in Rotational Motion
In studying linear motion, we found the energy concept — and, in particular, the
work – kinetic energy theorem — extremely useful in describing the motion of a
system. The energy concept can be equally useful in describing rotational motion.
From what we learned of linear motion, we expect that when a symmetric object
rotates about a ﬁxed axis, the work done by external forces equals the change in
the rotational energy.
To show that this is in fact the case, let us begin with   I. Using the chain
rule from the calculus, we can express the resultant torque as

A uniform rod of length L and mass M is free to rotate on a
frictionless pin passing through one end (Fig 10.23). The rod
is released from rest in the horizontal position. (a) What is its
angular speed when it reaches its lowest position?

Solution

The question can be answered by considering
the mechanical energy of the system. When the rod is horizontal, it has no rotational energy. The potential energy relative to the lowest position of the center of mass of the rod
(O) is MgL/2. When the rod reaches its lowest position, the

energy is entirely rotational energy, 12 I 2, where I is the moment of inertia about the pivot. Because I  13 ML 2 (see Table
10.2) and because mechanical energy is constant, we have

Consider two cylinders having masses m1 and m 2 , where m1 ⬆

Solution We are now able to account for the effect of a
massive pulley. Because the string does not slip, the pulley rotates. We neglect friction in the axle about which the pulley
rotates for the following reason: Because the axle’s radius is
small relative to that of the pulley, the frictional torque is
much smaller than the torque applied by the two cylinders,
provided that their masses are quite different. Mechanical energy is constant; hence, the increase in the system’s kinetic energy (the system being the two cylinders, the pulley, and the
Earth) equals the decrease in its potential energy. Because

If a particle rotates in a circle of radius r through an angle  (measured in radians), the arc length it moves through is s  r .

When a rigid object rotates about a ﬁxed axis, every part of the object has the

A useful technique in solving problems dealing with rotation is to visualize a linear

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
10.1 The fact that  is negative indicates that we are dealing
with an object that is rotating in the clockwise direction.
We also know that when ␻ and ␣ are antiparallel, 
must be decreasing — the object is slowing down. Therefore, the object is spinning more and more slowly (with
less and less angular speed) in the clockwise, or negative, direction. This has a linear analogy to a sky diver
opening her parachute. The velocity is negative — downward. When the sky diver opens the parachute, a large
upward force causes an upward acceleration. As a result,
the acceleration and velocity vectors are in opposite directions. Consequently, the parachutist slows down.
10.2 (a) Yes, all points on the wheel have the same angular
speed. This is why we use angular quantities to describe

rotational motion. (b) No, not all points on the wheel
have the same linear speed. (c) v  0, a  0.
(d) v  R/2, a  a r  v 2/(R/2)  R 2/2 (at is zero
at all points because  is constant).(e) v  R, a  R 2.
10.3 (a) I  MR 2. (b) I  MR 2. The moment of inertia of a
system of masses equidistant from an axis of rotation is
always the sum of the masses multiplied by the square of
the distance from the axis.
10.4 (b) Rotation about the axis through point P requires
more work. The moment of inertia of the hoop about
the center axis is I CM  MR 2, whereas, by the parallelaxis theorem, the moment of inertia about the axis
through point P is IP  I CM MR 2  MR 2 MR 2 

One of the most popular early bicycles
was the penny – farthing, introduced in
1870. The bicycle was so named because
the size relationship of its two wheels
was about the same as the size relationship of the penny and the farthing, two
English coins. When the rider looks down
at the top of the front wheel, he sees it
moving forward faster than he and the
handlebars are moving. Yet the center of
the wheel does not appear to be moving
at all relative to the handlebars. How can
different parts of the rolling wheel move
at different linear speeds? (© Steve

Rolling Motion and Angular Momentum

n the preceding chapter we learned how to treat a rigid body rotating about a
ﬁxed axis; in the present chapter, we move on to the more general case in
which the axis of rotation is not ﬁxed in space. We begin by describing such motion, which is called rolling motion. The central topic of this chapter is, however, angular momentum, a quantity that plays a key role in rotational dynamics. In analogy to the conservation of linear momentum, we ﬁnd that the angular momentum
of a rigid object is always conserved if no external torques act on the object. Like
the law of conservation of linear momentum, the law of conservation of angular
momentum is a fundamental law of physics, equally valid for relativistic and quantum systems.

ROLLING MOTION OF A RIGID OBJECT

In this section we treat the motion of a rigid object rotating about a moving axis.
In general, such motion is very complex. However, we can simplify matters by restricting our discussion to a homogeneous rigid object having a high degree of
symmetry, such as a cylinder, sphere, or hoop. Furthermore, we assume that the
object undergoes rolling motion along a ﬂat surface. We shall see that if an object
such as a cylinder rolls without slipping on the surface (we call this pure rolling motion), a simple relationship exists between its rotational and translational motions.
Suppose a cylinder is rolling on a straight path. As Figure 11.1 shows, the center of mass moves in a straight line, but a point on the rim moves in a more complex path called a cycloid. This means that the axis of rotation remains parallel to
its initial orientation in space. Consider a uniform cylinder of radius R rolling
without slipping on a horizontal surface (Fig. 11.2). As the cylinder rotates
through an angle , its center of mass moves a linear distance s  R (see Eq.
10.1a). Therefore, the linear speed of the center of mass for pure rolling motion is
given by
v CM 

where  is the angular velocity of the cylinder. Equation 11.1 holds whenever a
cylinder or sphere rolls without slipping and is the condition for pure rolling

Figure 11.1 One light source at the center of a rolling cylinder and another at one point on
the rim illustrate the different paths these two points take. The center moves in a straight line
(green line), whereas the point on the rim moves in the path called a cycloid (red curve). (Henry
Leap and Jim Lehman)

where  is the angular acceleration of the cylinder.
The linear velocities of the center of mass and of various points on and within
the cylinder are illustrated in Figure 11.3. A short time after the moment shown in
the drawing, the rim point labeled P will have rotated from the six o’clock position
to, say, the seven o’clock position, the point Q will have rotated from the ten
o’clock position to the eleven o’clock position, and so on. Note that the linear velocity of any point is in a direction perpendicular to the line from that point to the
contact point P. At any instant, the part of the rim that is at point P is at rest relative to the surface because slipping does not occur.
All points on the cylinder have the same angular speed. Therefore, because
the distance from P  to P is twice the distance from P to the center of mass, P  has
a speed 2v CM  2R. To see why this is so, let us model the rolling motion of the
cylinder in Figure 11.4 as a combination of translational (linear) motion and rotational motion. For the pure translational motion shown in Figure 11.4a, imagine
that the cylinder does not rotate, so that each point on it moves to the right with
speed v CM . For the pure rotational motion shown in Figure 11.4b, imagine that a
rotation axis through the center of mass is stationary, so that each point on the
cylinder has the same rotational speed . The combination of these two motions
represents the rolling motion shown in Figure 11.4c. Note in Figure 11.4c that the
top of the cylinder has linear speed v CM  R  v CM  v CM  2v CM , which is
greater than the linear speed of any other point on the cylinder. As noted earlier,
the center of mass moves with linear speed v CM while the contact point between
the surface and cylinder has a linear speed of zero.
We can express the total kinetic energy of the rolling cylinder as

The term 12 I CM 2 represents the rotational kinetic energy of the cylinder about its
center of mass, and the term 12Mv CM2 represents the kinetic energy the cylinder
would have if it were just translating through space without rotating. Thus, we can
say that the total kinetic energy of a rolling object is the sum of the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass and the translational kinetic
energy of the center of mass.
We can use energy methods to treat a class of problems concerning the rolling
motion of a sphere down a rough incline. (The analysis that follows also applies to
the rolling motion of a cylinder or hoop.) We assume that the sphere in Figure
11.5 rolls without slipping and is released from rest at the top of the incline. Note
that accelerated rolling motion is possible only if a frictional force is present between the sphere and the incline to produce a net torque about the center of mass.
Despite the presence of friction, no loss of mechanical energy occurs because the
contact point is at rest relative to the surface at any instant. On the other hand, if
the sphere were to slip, mechanical energy would be lost as motion progressed.

11.1 Rolling Motion of a Rigid Object

By the time the sphere reaches the bottom of the incline, work equal to Mgh has
been done on it by the gravitational ﬁeld, where h is the height of the incline. Because the sphere starts from rest at the top, its kinetic energy at the bottom, given
by Equation 11.5, must equal this work done. Therefore, the speed of the center of
mass at the bottom can be obtained by equating these two quantities:

Quick Quiz 11.1
Imagine that you slide your textbook across a gymnasium ﬂoor with a certain initial speed.
It quickly stops moving because of friction between it and the ﬂoor. Yet, if you were to start
a basketball rolling with the same initial speed, it would probably keep rolling from one end
of the gym to the other. Why does a basketball roll so far? Doesn’t friction affect its motion?

EXAMPLE 11.1

Sphere Rolling Down an Incline

For the solid sphere shown in Figure 11.5, calculate the linear
speed of the center of mass at the bottom of the incline and
the magnitude of the linear acceleration of the center of mass.

x sin . Hence, after squaring both sides, we can express the
equation above as
v CM2  10

Solution

Comparing this with the expression from kinematics,
v CM2  2a CMx (see Eq. 2.12), we see that the acceleration of
the center of mass is

The sphere starts from the top of the incline
with potential energy U g  Mgh and kinetic energy K  0. As
we have seen before, if it fell vertically from that height, it
would have a linear speed of !2gh at the moment before it hit
the ﬂoor. After rolling down the incline, the linear speed of
the center of mass must be less than this value because some
of the initial potential energy is diverted into rotational kinetic energy rather than all being converted into translational kinetic energy. For a uniform solid sphere, I CM 

These results are quite interesting in that both the speed
and the acceleration of the center of mass are independent of
the mass and the radius of the sphere! That is, all homogeneous solid spheres experience the same speed and acceleration on a given incline.
If we repeated the calculations for a hollow sphere, a solid
cylinder, or a hoop, we would obtain similar results in which
only the factor in front of g sin  would differ. The constant
factors that appear in the expressions for v CM and a CM depend
only on the moment of inertia about the center of mass for the
speciﬁc body. In all cases, the acceleration of the center of
mass is less than g sin , the value the acceleration would have if
the incline were frictionless and no rolling occurred.

through the center of the sphere and is perpendicular to the
plane of the ﬁgure.1 Because n and Mg go through the center of mass, they have zero moment arm about this axis and
thus do not contribute to the torque. However, the force of
static friction produces a torque about this axis equal to fR in
the clockwise direction; therefore, because is also in the

which agrees with the result of Example 11.1.
Note that F  ma applies only if F is the net external
force exerted on the sphere and a is the acceleration of its
center of mass. In the case of our sphere rolling down an incline, even though the frictional force does not change the
total kinetic energy of the sphere, it does contribute to F
and thus decreases the acceleration of the center of mass. As
a result, the ﬁnal translational kinetic energy is less than it
would be in the absence of friction. As mentioned in Example 11.1, some of the initial potential energy is converted to
rotational kinetic energy.

THE VECTOR PRODUCT AND TORQUE

Consider a force F acting on a rigid body at the vector position r (Fig. 11.7). The
origin O is assumed to be in an inertial frame, so Newton’s ﬁrst law is valid
in this case. As we saw in Section 10.6, the magnitude of the torque due to this
force relative to the origin is, by deﬁnition, rF sin , where is the angle between
r and F. The axis about which F tends to produce rotation is perpendicular to the
plane formed by r and F. If the force lies in the xy plane, as it does in Figure 11.7,
the torque ␶ is represented by a vector parallel to the z axis. The force in Figure
11.7 creates a torque that tends to rotate the body counterclockwise about the z
axis; thus the direction of ␶ is toward increasing z, and ␶ is therefore in the positive
z direction. If we reversed the direction of F in Figure 11.7, then ␶ would be in the
negative z direction.
The torque ␶ involves the two vectors r and F, and its direction is perpendicular to the plane of r and F. We can establish a mathematical relationship between
␶, r, and F, using a new mathematical operation called the vector product, or
cross product:

␶⬅rⴛF

Torque
1

(11.7)

Although a coordinate system whose origin is at the center of mass of a rolling object is not an inertial frame, the expression CM  I still applies in the center-of-mass frame.

333

11.2 The Vector Product and Torque
z

We now give a formal deﬁnition of the vector product. Given any two vectors A
and B, the vector product A ⴛ B is deﬁned as a third vector C, the magnitude of
which is AB sin , where  is the angle between A and B. That is, if C is given by
CAⴛB

(11.8)

C ⬅ AB sin 

(11.9)

τ = r × F

then its magnitude is
The quantity AB sin  is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by A and B,
as shown in Figure 11.8. The direction of C is perpendicular to the plane formed by
A and B, and the best way to determine this direction is to use the right-hand rule
illustrated in Figure 11.8. The four ﬁngers of the right hand are pointed along A
and then “wrapped” into B through the angle . The direction of the erect right
thumb is the direction of A ⴛ B  C. Because of the notation, A ⴛ B is often read
“A cross B”; hence, the term cross product.
Some properties of the vector product that follow from its deﬁnition are as
follows:
1. Unlike the scalar product, the vector product is not commutative. Instead, the
order in which the two vectors are multiplied in a cross product is important:
A ⴛ B  B ⴛ A

A ⴛ (B  C)  A ⴛ B  A ⴛ C

(11.11)

5. The derivative of the cross product with respect to some variable such as t is

dA
(A ⴛ B)  A ⴛ

ⴛB
dt
dt
dt

(11.12)

where it is important to preserve the multiplicative order of A and B, in view of
Equation 11.10.
It is left as an exercise to show from Equations 11.9 and 11.10 and from the
deﬁnition of unit vectors that the cross products of the rectangular unit vectors i,

Figure 11.8 The vector product
A ⴛ B is a third vector C having a
magnitude AB sin  equal to the area
of the parallelogram shown. The direction of C is perpendicular to the
plane formed by A and B, and this
direction is determined by the righthand rule.

F

The torque vector ␶
lies in a direction perpendicular to
the plane formed by the position
vector r and the applied force vector F.

Figure 11.7

(11.10)

Therefore, if you change the order of the vectors in a cross product, you must
change the sign. You could easily verify this relationship with the right-hand
rule.
2. If A is parallel to B (  0° or 180°), then A ⴛ B  0; therefore, it follows that
A ⴛ A  0.

(We have omitted the terms containing i ⴛ i and j ⴛ j because, as Equation 11.13a shows, they are equal to zero.)
We can show that A ⴛ B   B ⴛ A, since

ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A PARTICLE

Imagine a rigid pole sticking up through the ice on a frozen pond (Fig. 11.9). A
skater glides rapidly toward the pole, aiming a little to the side so that she does not
hit it. As she approaches a point beside the pole, she reaches out and grabs the
pole, an action that whips her rapidly into a circular path around the pole. Just as
the idea of linear momentum helps us analyze translational motion, a rotational
analog — angular momentum — helps us describe this skater and other objects undergoing rotational motion.
To analyze the motion of the skater, we need to know her mass and her velocity, as well as her position relative to the pole. In more general terms, consider a

11.3 Angular Momentum of a Particle

particle of mass m located at the vector position r and moving with linear velocity v
(Fig. 11.10).
The instantaneous angular momentum L of the particle relative to the origin O
is deﬁned as the cross product of the particle’s instantaneous position vector r
and its instantaneous linear momentum p:
L⬅rⴛp

(11.15)

Angular momentum of a particle

The SI unit of angular momentum is kg m2/s. It is important to note that both
the magnitude and the direction of L depend on the choice of origin. Following
the right-hand rule, note that the direction of L is perpendicular to the plane
formed by r and p. In Figure 11.10, r and p are in the xy plane, and so L points in
the z direction. Because p  m v, the magnitude of L is
L  mvr sin

(11.16)

where is the angle between r and p. It follows that L is zero when r is parallel to
p (  0 or 180°). In other words, when the linear velocity of the particle is along
a line that passes through the origin, the particle has zero angular momentum
with respect to the origin. On the other hand, if r is perpendicular to p (  90°),
then L  mvr. At that instant, the particle moves exactly as if it were on the rim of
a wheel rotating about the origin in a plane deﬁned by r and p.

Quick Quiz 11.3
Recall the skater described at the beginning of this section. What would be her angular momentum relative to the pole if she were skating directly toward it?

Figure 11.9 As the skater passes
the pole, she grabs hold of it. This
causes her to swing around the
pole rapidly in a circular path.

In describing linear motion, we found that the net force on a particle equals the
time rate of change of its linear momentum, F  dp/dt (see Eq. 9.3). We now
show that the net torque acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of its angular momentum. Let us start by writing the net torque on the particle in the form

depends on the origin about which
it is measured and is a vector perpendicular to both r and p.

which is the rotational analog of Newton’s second law, F  d p/dt. Note that
torque causes the angular momentum L to change just as force causes linear momentum p to change. This rotational result, Equation 11.19, states that
the net torque acting on a particle is equal to the time rate of change of the
particle’s angular momentum.

It is important to note that Equation 11.19 is valid only if ␶ and L are measured
about the same origin. (Of course, the same origin must be used in calculating all
of the torques.) Furthermore, the expression is valid for any origin ﬁxed in an
inertial frame.

Angular Momentum of a System of Particles
The total angular momentum of a system of particles about some point is deﬁned
as the vector sum of the angular momenta of the individual particles:
L  L1  L2 

 Ln   Li
i

where the vector sum is over all n particles in the system.
Because individual angular momenta can change with time, so can the total
angular momentum. In fact, from Equations 11.18 and 11.19, we ﬁnd that the
time rate of change of the total angular momentum equals the vector sum of
all torques acting on the system, both those associated with internal forces
between particles and those associated with external forces. However, the net
torque associated with all internal forces is zero. To understand this, recall
that Newton’s third law tells us that internal forces between particles of the system are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. If we assume that these
forces lie along the line of separation of each pair of particles, then the torque
due to each action – reaction force pair is zero. That is, the moment arm d from
O to the line of action of the forces is equal for both particles. In the summation, therefore, we see that the net internal torque vanishes. We conclude that
the total angular momentum of a system can vary with time only if a net external torque is acting on the system, so that we have

That is,
the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system about some
origin in an inertial frame equals the net external torque acting on the system
about that origin.

Note that Equation 11.20 is the rotational analog of Equation 9.38, Fext  dp/dt ,
for a system of particles.

11.4 Angular Momentum of a Rotating Rigid Object

EXAMPLE 11.4

Circular Motion

A particle moves in the xy plane in a circular path of radius r,
as shown in Figure 11.11. (a) Find the magnitude and direction of its angular momentum relative to O when its linear velocity is v.

Solution You might guess that because the linear momentum of the particle is always changing (in direction, not magnitude), the direction of the angular momentum must also
change. In this example, however, this is not the case. The
magnitude of L is given by
L  mvr sin 90°  mvr

(for r perpendicular to v)

This value of L is constant because all three factors on the
right are constant. The direction of L also is constant, even

though the direction of p  m v keeps changing. You can visualize this by sliding the vector v in Figure 11.11 parallel to
itself until its tail meets the tail of r and by then applying the
right-hand rule. (You can use v to determine the direction of
L  r ⴛ p because the direction of p is the same as the direction of v.) Line up your ﬁngers so that they point along r and
wrap your ﬁngers into the vector v. Your thumb points upward and away from the page; this is the direction of L.
Hence, we can write the vector expression L  (mvr)k. If
the particle were to move clockwise, L would point downward and into the page.
(b) Find the magnitude and direction of L in terms of the
particle’s angular speed .

Solution Because v  r for a particle rotating in a circle,
we can express L as

v

m

where I is the moment of inertia of the particle about the z
axis through O. Because the rotation is counterclockwise, the
direction of ␻ is along the z axis (see Section 10.1). The direction of L is the same as that of ␻, and so we can write the
angular momentum as L  I␻  Ik.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF A
ROTATING RIGID OBJECT

Consider a rigid object rotating about a ﬁxed axis that coincides with the z axis of
a coordinate system, as shown in Figure 11.12. Let us determine the angular momentum of this object. Each particle of the object rotates in the xy plane about the
z axis with an angular speed . The magnitude of the angular momentum of a particle of mass mi about the origin O is m i vi ri . Because vi  ri , we can express the
magnitude of the angular momentum of this particle as
L i  m i r i 2
The vector Li is directed along the z axis, as is the vector ␻.

CHAPTER 11

Rolling Motion and Angular Momentum

We can now ﬁnd the angular momentum (which in this situation has only a z
component) of the whole object by taking the sum of Li over all particles:

where I is the moment of inertia of the object about the z axis.

When a rigid body
rotates about an axis, the angular

(11.21)

(11.22)

where  is the angular acceleration relative to the axis of rotation. Because dL z /dt
is equal to the net external torque (see Eq. 11.20), we can express Equation 11.22
as



(11.23)

That is, the net external torque acting on a rigid object rotating about a ﬁxed
axis equals the moment of inertia about the rotation axis multiplied by the object’s angular acceleration relative to that axis.

Equation 11.23 also is valid for a rigid object rotating about a moving axis provided the moving axis (1) passes through the center of mass and (2) is a symmetry
axis.
You should note that if a symmetrical object rotates about a ﬁxed axis passing
through its center of mass, you can write Equation 11.21 in vector form as L  I␻,
where L is the total angular momentum of the object measured with respect to the
axis of rotation. Furthermore, the expression is valid for any object, regardless of
its symmetry, if L stands for the component of angular momentum along the axis
of rotation.2

EXAMPLE 11.5

Bowling Ball

Estimate the magnitude of the angular momentum of a bowling ball spinning at 10 rev/s, as shown in Figure 11.13.

Solution

We start by making some estimates of the relevant physical parameters and model the ball as a uniform

solid sphere. A typical bowling ball might have a mass of 6 kg
and a radius of 12 cm. The moment of inertia of a solid
sphere about an axis through its center is, from Table 10.2,
I  25MR 2  25(6 kg)(0.12 m)2  0.035 kg m2
Therefore, the magnitude of the angular momentum is

In general, the expression L  I␻ is not always valid. If a rigid object rotates about an arbitrary axis,
L and ␻ may point in different directions. In this case, the moment of inertia cannot be treated as a
scalar. Strictly speaking, L  I␻ applies only to rigid objects of any shape that rotate about one of three
mutually perpendicular axes (called principal axes) through the center of mass. This is discussed in
more advanced texts on mechanics.

for the moment of inertia of the rod, and using the expression I  mr 2 for each particle, we ﬁnd that the total moment

EXAMPLE 11.7

Rolling Motion and Angular Momentum

Two Connected Masses

A sphere of mass m 1 and a block of mass m 2 are connected by
a light cord that passes over a pulley, as shown in Figure
11.15. The radius of the pulley is R, and the moment of inertia about its axle is I. The block slides on a frictionless, horizontal surface. Find an expression for the linear acceleration
of the two objects, using the concepts of angular momentum
and torque.

Solution We need to determine the angular momentum
of the system, which consists of the two objects and the pulley. Let us calculate the angular momentum about an axis
that coincides with the axle of the pulley.
At the instant the sphere and block have a common speed
v, the angular momentum of the sphere is m 1 vR , and that of
the block is m 2 vR . At the same instant, the angular momentum of the pulley is I  Iv/R. Hence, the total angular momentum of the system is
L  m 1vR  m 2vR  I

(1)

v

Now let us evaluate the total external torque acting on the
system about the pulley axle. Because it has a moment arm of
zero, the force exerted by the axle on the pulley does not
contribute to the torque. Furthermore, the normal force acting on the block is balanced by the force of gravity m 2 g, and
so these forces do not contribute to the torque. The force of
gravity m 1 g acting on the sphere produces a torque about the
axle equal in magnitude to m 1 gR, where R is the moment
arm of the force about the axle. (Note that in this situation,
the tension is not equal to m 1 g.) This is the total external
torque about the pulley axle; that is,  ext  m 1 gR. Using this
result, together with Equation (1) and Equation 11.23, we
ﬁnd

You may wonder why we did not include the forces that the
cord exerts on the objects in evaluating the net torque about
the axle. The reason is that these forces are internal to the
system under consideration, and we analyzed the system as a
whole. Only external torques contribute to the change in the
system’s angular momentum.

CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM

In Chapter 9 we found that the total linear momentum of a system of particles remains constant when the resultant external force acting on the system is zero. We
have an analogous conservation law in rotational motion:
The total angular momentum of a system is constant in both magnitude and direction if the resultant external torque acting on the system is zero.
This follows directly from Equation 11.20, which indicates that if

 ␶ext 
then

dL
0
dt

L  constant

(11.24)
(11.25)

For a system of particles, we write this conservation law as  Ln  constant, where
the index n denotes the nth particle in the system.

341

11.5 Conservation of Angular Momentum

If the mass of an object undergoes redistribution in some way, then the object’s moment of inertia changes; hence, its angular speed must change because
L  I. In this case we express the conservation of angular momentum in the form
L i  L f  constant

(11.26)

If the system is an object rotating about a ﬁxed axis, such as the z axis, we can
write Lz  I, where Lz is the component of L along the axis of rotation and I is
the moment of inertia about this axis. In this case, we can express the conservation
of angular momentum as
I i i  I f f  constant

(11.27)

This expression is valid both for rotation about a ﬁxed axis and for rotation about
an axis through the center of mass of a moving system as long as that axis remains
parallel to itself. We require only that the net external torque be zero.
Although we do not prove it here, there is an important theorem concerning
the angular momentum of an object relative to the object’s center of mass:
The resultant torque acting on an object about an axis through the center of
mass equals the time rate of change of angular momentum regardless of the
motion of the center of mass.
This theorem applies even if the center of mass is accelerating, provided ␶ and L
are evaluated relative to the center of mass.
In Equation 11.26 we have a third conservation law to add to our list. We can
now state that the energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum of an isolated system all remain constant:
K i  Ui  K f  Uf
pi  pf
Li  L f

冧

For an isolated system

There are many examples that demonstrate conservation of angular momentum. You may have observed a ﬁgure skater spinning in the ﬁnale of a program.
The angular speed of the skater increases when the skater pulls his hands and feet
close to his body, thereby decreasing I. Neglecting friction between skates and ice,
no external torques act on the skater. The change in angular speed is due to the
fact that, because angular momentum is conserved, the product I remains constant, and a decrease in the moment of inertia of the skater causes an increase in
the angular speed. Similarly, when divers or acrobats wish to make several somersaults, they pull their hands and feet close to their bodies to rotate at a higher rate.
In these cases, the external force due to gravity acts through the center of mass
and hence exerts no torque about this point. Therefore, the angular momentum
about the center of mass must be conserved — that is, I i i  I f f . For example,
when divers wish to double their angular speed, they must reduce their moment of
inertia to one-half its initial value.

Formation of a Neutron Star

A star rotates with a period of 30 days about an axis through
its center. After the star undergoes a supernova explosion,
the stellar core, which had a radius of 1.0 104 km, collapses
into a neutron star of radius 3.0 km. Determine the period of
rotation of the neutron star.

Solution The same physics that makes a skater spin faster
with his arms pulled in describes the motion of the neutron
star. Let us assume that during the collapse of the stellar core,
(1) no torque acts on it, (2) it remains spherical, and (3) its
mass remains constant. Also, let us use the symbol T for the
period, with Ti being the initial period of the star and Tf being the period of the neutron star. The period is the length

of time a point on the star’s equator takes to make one complete circle around the axis of rotation. The angular speed of

The Merry-Go-Round

A horizontal platform in the shape of a circular disk rotates
in a horizontal plane about a frictionless vertical axle (Fig.
11.16). The platform has a mass M  100 kg and a radius
R  2.0 m. A student whose mass is m  60 kg walks slowly
from the rim of the disk toward its center. If the angular
speed of the system is 2.0 rad/s when the student is at the
rim, what is the angular speed when he has reached a point
r  0.50 m from the center?

Solution The speed change here is similar to the increase
in angular speed of the spinning skater when he pulls his
arms inward. Let us denote the moment of inertia of the platform as Ip and that of the student as Is . Treating the student
as a point mass, we can write the initial moment of inertia I i
of the system (student plus platform) about the axis of rotation:

Note that we still use the greater radius R when calculating Ipf
because the radius of the platform has not changed. Because
no external torques act on the system about the axis of rotation,
we can apply the law of conservation of angular momentum:

EXAMPLE 11.10

The Spinning Bicycle Wheel

In a favorite classroom demonstration, a student holds the
axle of a spinning bicycle wheel while seated on a stool that is
free to rotate (Fig. 11.17). The student and stool are initially
at rest while the wheel is spinning in a horizontal plane with
an initial angular momentum Li that points upward. When
the wheel is inverted about its center by 180°, the student and
Li

stool start rotating. In terms of Li , what are the magnitude
and the direction of L for the student plus stool?

Solution The system consists of the student, the wheel,
and the stool. Initially, the total angular momentum of the
system Li comes entirely from the spinning wheel. As the
wheel is inverted, the student applies a torque to the wheel,
but this torque is internal to the system. No external torque is
acting on the system about the vertical axis. Therefore, the
angular momentum of the system is conserved. Initially, we
have
L system  L i  L wheel

(upward)

After the wheel is inverted, we have Linverted wheel   L i . For
angular momentum to be conserved, some other part of the
system has to start rotating so that the total angular momentum remains the initial angular momentum L i . That other
part of the system is the student plus the stool she is sitting
on. So, we can now state that
L f  L i  L studentstool  L i

Rolling Motion and Angular Momentum

Disk and Stick

A 2.0-kg disk traveling at 3.0 m/s strikes a 1.0-kg stick that is
lying ﬂat on nearly frictionless ice, as shown in Figure 11.18.
Assume that the collision is elastic. Find the translational
speed of the disk, the translational speed of the stick, and the
rotational speed of the stick after the collision. The moment
of inertia of the stick about its center of mass is 1.33 kg m2.

We used the fact that radians are dimensionless to ensure
consistent units for each term.
Finally, the elastic nature of the collision reminds us that
kinetic energy is conserved; in this case, the kinetic energy
consists of translational and rotational forms:
Ki  Kf
1
2
2 m dv di

Solution

Because the disk and stick form an isolated system, we can assume that total energy, linear momentum, and
angular momentum are all conserved. We have three unknowns, and so we need three equations to solve simultaneously. The ﬁrst comes from the law of the conservation of linear momentum:
pi  pf
m dv di  m dv d f  m sv s
(2.0 kg)(3.0 m/s)  (2.0 kg)v d f  (1.0 kg)v s
(1)

6.0 kg m/s  (2.0 kg)v d f  (1.0 kg)v s

Now we apply the law of conservation of angular momentum, using the initial position of the center of the stick as our
reference point. We know that the component of angular momentum of the disk along the axis perpendicular to the plane
of the ice is negative (the right-hand rule shows that Ld points
into the ice).

11.6 The Motion of Gyroscopes and Tops

Optional Section

11.6

THE MOTION OF GYROSCOPES AND TOPS

A very unusual and fascinating type of motion you probably have observed is that
of a top spinning about its axis of symmetry, as shown in Figure 11.19a. If the top
spins very rapidly, the axis rotates about the z axis, sweeping out a cone (see Fig.
11.19b). The motion of the axis about the vertical — known as precessional motion — is usually slow relative to the spin motion of the top.
It is quite natural to wonder why the top does not fall over. Because the center
of mass is not directly above the pivot point O, a net torque is clearly acting on the
top about O — a torque resulting from the force of gravity Mg. The top would certainly fall over if it were not spinning. Because it is spinning, however, it has an angular momentum L directed along its symmetry axis. As we shall show, the motion
of this symmetry axis about the z axis (the precessional motion) occurs because
the torque produces a change in the direction of the symmetry axis. This is an
excellent example of the importance of the directional nature of angular
momentum.
The two forces acting on the top are the downward force of gravity Mg and
the normal force n acting upward at the pivot point O. The normal force produces
no torque about the pivot because its moment arm through that point is zero.
However, the force of gravity produces a torque ␶  r ⴛ Mg about O, where the
direction of ␶ is perpendicular to the plane formed by r and Mg. By necessity, the
vector ␶ lies in a horizontal xy plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector. The net torque and angular momentum of the top are related through Equation 11.19:

␶

dL
dt

From this expression, we see that the nonzero torque produces a change in angular momentum d L — a change that is in the same direction as ␶. Therefore, like
the torque vector, d L must also be at right angles to L. Figure 11.19b illustrates the
resulting precessional motion of the symmetry axis of the top. In a time t, the
change in angular momentum is L  L f  L i  ␶ t. Because L is perpendicular to L, the magnitude of L does not change (兩 L i 兩  兩 L f 兩). Rather, what is changing is the direction of L. Because the change in angular momentum L is in the direction of ␶, which lies in the xy plane, the top undergoes precessional motion.
The essential features of precessional motion can be illustrated by considering
the simple gyroscope shown in Figure 11.20a. This device consists of a wheel free
to spin about an axle that is pivoted at a distance h from the center of mass of the
wheel. When given an angular velocity ␻ about the axle, the wheel has an angular
momentum L  I␻ directed along the axle as shown. Let us consider the torque
acting on the wheel about the pivot O. Again, the force n exerted by the support
on the axle produces no torque about O, and the force of gravity Mg produces a
torque of magnitude Mgh about O, where the axle is perpendicular to the support.
The direction of this torque is perpendicular to the axle (and perpendicular to L),
as shown in Figure 11.20a. This torque causes the angular momentum to change
in the direction perpendicular to the axle. Hence, the axle moves in the direction
of the torque — that is, in the horizontal plane.
To simplify the description of the system, we must make an assumption: The
total angular momentum of the precessing wheel is the sum of the angular momentum I␻ due to the spinning and the angular momentum due to the motion of

The vector diagram in Figure 11.20b shows that in the time dt, the angular
momentum vector rotates through an angle d , which is also the angle through
which the axle rotates. From the vector triangle formed by the vectors Li , Lf , and
d L, we see that

you can see from Equation 11.28, the condition p V  is met when I is great
compared with Mgh. Furthermore, note that the precessional frequency decreases
as  increases — that is, as the wheel spins faster about its axis of symmetry.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM AS A
FUNDAMENTAL QUANTITY

We have seen that the concept of angular momentum is very useful for describing the
motion of macroscopic systems. However, the concept also is valid on a submicroscopic scale and has been used extensively in the development of modern theories of
atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. In these developments, it was found that the
angular momentum of a system is a fundamental quantity. The word fundamental in
this context implies that angular momentum is an intrinsic property of atoms, molecules, and their constituents, a property that is a part of their very nature.
To explain the results of a variety of experiments on atomic and molecular systems, we rely on the fact that the angular momentum has discrete values. These
discrete values are multiples of the fundamental unit of angular momentum
  h/2 , where h is called Planck’s constant:

Let us accept this postulate without proof for the time being and show how it
can be used to estimate the angular speed of a diatomic molecule. Consider the
O2 molecule as a rigid rotor, that is, two atoms separated by a ﬁxed distance d and
rotating about the center of mass (Fig. 11.21). Equating the angular momentum
to the fundamental unit , we can estimate the lowest angular speed:

In Example 10.3, we found that the moment of inertia of the O2 molecule
about this axis of rotation is 1.95 1046 kg m2. Therefore,

Actual angular speeds are multiples of this smallest possible value.
This simple example shows that certain classical concepts and models, when
properly modiﬁed, might be useful in describing some features of atomic and molecular systems. A wide variety of phenomena on the submicroscopic scale can be
explained only if we assume discrete values of the angular momentum associated
with a particular type of motion.
The Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) accepted and adopted this radical idea of discrete angular momentum values in developing his theory of the hydrogen atom. Strictly classical models were unsuccessful in describing many properties of the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that the electron could occupy only
those circular orbits about the proton for which the orbital angular momentum
was equal to n, where n is an integer. That is, he made the bold assumption that
orbital angular momentum is quantized. From this simple model, the rotational
frequencies of the electron in the various orbits can be estimated (see Problem 43).

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
11.1 There is very little resistance to motion that can reduce
the kinetic energy of the rolling ball. Even though there
is friction between the ball and the ﬂoor (if there were
not, then no rotation would occur, and the ball would
slide), there is no relative motion of the two surfaces (by
the deﬁnition of “rolling”), and so kinetic friction cannot reduce K. (Air drag and friction associated with deformation of the ball eventually stop the ball.)
11.2 The box. Because none of the box’s initial potential energy is converted to rotational kinetic energy, at any time
t  0 its translational kinetic energy is greater than that
of the rolling ball.
11.3 Zero. If she were moving directly toward the pole, r and
p would be antiparallel to each other, and the sine of
the angle between them is zero; therefore, L  0.

11.4 Both (a) and (b) are false. The net force is not necessarily zero. If the line of action of the net force passes
through the point, then the net torque about an axis
passing through that point is zero even though the net
force is not zero. Because the net force is not necessarily
zero, you cannot conclude that the particle’s velocity is
constant.
11.5 The student does work as he walks from the rim of the
platform toward its center.
11.6 Because it is perpendicular to the precessional motion
of the top, the force of gravity does no work. This is a situation in which a force causes motion but does no work.

CHAPTER 12

Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

I

n Chapters 10 and 11 we studied the dynamics of rigid objects — that is, objects
whose parts remain at a ﬁxed separation with respect to each other when subjected to external forces. Part of this chapter addresses the conditions under
which a rigid object is in equilibrium. The term equilibrium implies either that the
object is at rest or that its center of mass moves with constant velocity. We deal
here only with the former case, in which the object is described as being in static
equilibrium. Static equilibrium represents a common situation in engineering practice, and the principles it involves are of special interest to civil engineers, architects, and mechanical engineers. If you are an engineering student you will undoubtedly take an advanced course in statics in the future.
The last section of this chapter deals with how objects deform under load conditions. Such deformations are usually elastic and do not affect the conditions for
equilibrium. An elastic object returns to its original shape when the deforming
forces are removed. Several elastic constants are deﬁned, each corresponding to a
different type of deformation.

THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUILIBRIUM

In Chapter 5 we stated that one necessary condition for equilibrium is that the net
force acting on an object be zero. If the object is treated as a particle, then this is
the only condition that must be satisﬁed for equilibrium. The situation with real
(extended) objects is more complex, however, because these objects cannot be
treated as particles. For an extended object to be in static equilibrium, a second
condition must be satisﬁed. This second condition involves the net torque acting
on the extended object. Note that equilibrium does not require the absence of
motion. For example, a rotating object can have constant angular velocity and still
be in equilibrium.
Consider a single force F acting on a rigid object, as shown in Figure 12.1. The
effect of the force depends on its point of application P. If r is the position vector
of this point relative to O, the torque associated with the force F about O is given
by Equation 11.7:

P

␶rⴛF
r

d

O

Figure 12.1 A single force F acts
on a rigid object at the point P.

Equivalent forces

Recall from the discussion of the vector product in Section 11.2 that the vector ␶ is
perpendicular to the plane formed by r and F. You can use the right-hand rule to
determine the direction of ␶ : Curl the ﬁngers of your right hand in the direction
of rotation that F tends to cause about an axis through O : your thumb then points
in the direction of ␶. Hence, in Figure 12.1 ␶ is directed toward you out of the
page.
As you can see from Figure 12.1, the tendency of F to rotate the object about
an axis through O depends on the moment arm d, as well as on the magnitude of
F. Recall that the magnitude of ␶ is Fd (see Eq. 10.19). Now suppose a rigid object
is acted on ﬁrst by force F1 and later by force F2 . If the two forces have the same
magnitude, they will produce the same effect on the object only if they have the
same direction and the same line of action. In other words,
two forces F1 and F2 are equivalent if and only if F1  F2 and if and only if the
two produce the same torque about any axis.
The two forces shown in Figure 12.2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction. They are not equivalent. The force directed to the right tends to rotate

363

12.1 The Conditions for Equilibrium

the object clockwise about an axis perpendicular to the diagram through O,
whereas the force directed to the left tends to rotate it counterclockwise about that
axis.
Suppose an object is pivoted about an axis through its center of mass, as
shown in Figure 12.3. Two forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions
along parallel lines of action. A pair of forces acting in this manner form what is
called a couple. (The two forces shown in Figure 12.2 also form a couple.) Do not
make the mistake of thinking that the forces in a couple are a result of Newton’s
third law. They cannot be third-law forces because they act on the same object.
Third-law force pairs act on different objects. Because each force produces the
same torque Fd, the net torque has a magnitude of 2Fd. Clearly, the object rotates
clockwise and undergoes an angular acceleration about the axis. With respect to
rotational motion, this is a nonequilibrium situation. The net torque on the object gives rise to an angular acceleration  according to the relationship  
2Fd  I (see Eq. 10.21).
In general, an object is in rotational equilibrium only if its angular acceleration   0. Because   I for rotation about a ﬁxed axis, our second necessary
condition for equilibrium is that the net torque about any axis must be zero.
We now have two necessary conditions for equilibrium of an object:

The ﬁrst condition is a statement of translational equilibrium; it tells us that the
linear acceleration of the center of mass of the object must be zero when viewed
from an inertial reference frame. The second condition is a statement of rotational equilibrium and tells us that the angular acceleration about any axis must
be zero. In the special case of static equilibrium, which is the main subject of this
chapter, the object is at rest and so has no linear or angular speed (that is, vCM  0
and   0).

Quick Quiz 12.1
(a) Is it possible for a situation to exist in which Equation 12.1 is satisﬁed while Equation
12.2 is not? (b) Can Equation 12.2 be satisﬁed while Equation 12.1 is not?

The two vector expressions given by Equations 12.1 and 12.2 are equivalent, in
general, to six scalar equations: three from the ﬁrst condition for equilibrium, and
three from the second (corresponding to x, y, and z components). Hence, in a
complex system involving several forces acting in various directions, you could be
faced with solving a set of equations with many unknowns. Here, we restrict our
discussion to situations in which all the forces lie in the xy plane. (Forces whose
vector representations are in the same plane are said to be coplanar.) With this restriction, we must deal with only three scalar equations. Two of these come from
balancing the forces in the x and y directions. The third comes from the torque
equation — namely, that the net torque about any point in the xy plane must be
zero. Hence, the two conditions of equilibrium provide the equations

where the axis of the torque equation is arbitrary, as we now show.

magnitude form a couple if their
lines of action are different parallel
lines. In this case, the object rotates
clockwise. The net torque about
any axis is 2Fd.

364

CHAPTER 12

Regardless of the number of forces that are acting, if an object is in translational equilibrium and if the net torque is zero about one axis, then the net torque
must also be zero about any other axis. The point can be inside or outside the
boundaries of the object. Consider an object being acted on by several forces such
that the resultant force F  F1  F2  F3 
 0. Figure 12.4 describes this
situation (for clarity, only four forces are shown). The point of application of F1
relative to O is speciﬁed by the position vector r1 . Similarly, the points of application of F2 , F3 , . . . are speciﬁed by r2 , r3 , . . . (not shown). The net torque
about an axis through O is

Now consider another arbitrary point O having a position vector r relative to
O. The point of application of F1 relative to O is identiﬁed by the vector r1  r.
Likewise, the point of application of F2 relative to O is r2  r, and so forth.
Therefore, the torque about an axis through O is

 ␶O   (r1  r) ⴛ F1  (r2  r) ⴛ F2  (r3  r) ⴛ F3 

Because the net force is assumed to be zero (given that the object is in translational equilibrium), the last term vanishes, and we see that the torque about O is
equal to the torque about O. Hence, if an object is in translational equilibrium
and the net torque is zero about one point, then the net torque must be zero
about any other point.

MORE ON THE CENTER OF GRAVITY

We have seen that the point at which a force is applied can be critical in determining how an object responds to that force. For example, two equal-magnitude but
oppositely directed forces result in equilibrium if they are applied at the same
point on an object. However, if the point of application of one of the forces is
moved, so that the two forces no longer act along the same line of action, then a
force couple results and the object undergoes an angular acceleration. (This is the
situation shown in Figure 12.3.)
Whenever we deal with a rigid object, one of the forces we must consider is
the force of gravity acting on it, and we must know the point of application of this
force. As we learned in Section 9.6, on every object is a special point called its center of gravity. All the various gravitational forces acting on all the various mass elements of the object are equivalent to a single gravitational force acting through
this point. Thus, to compute the torque due to the gravitational force on an object
of mass M, we need only consider the force Mg acting at the center of gravity of
the object.
How do we ﬁnd this special point? As we mentioned in Section 9.6, if
we assume that g is uniform over the object, then the center of gravity of
the object coincides with its center of mass. To see that this is so, consider an
object of arbitrary shape lying in the xy plane, as illustrated in Figure 12.5.
Suppose the object is divided into a large number of particles of masses
m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , . . . having coordinates (x 1 , y 1 ), (x 2 , y 2 ), (x 3 , y 3 ), . . . . In

We use a similar equation to deﬁne the y coordinate of the center of mass, replacing each x with its y counterpart.
Let us now examine the situation from another point of view by considering the force of gravity exerted on each particle, as shown in Figure 12.6.
Each particle contributes a torque about the origin equal in magnitude to the
particle’s weight mg multiplied by its moment arm. For example, the torque due
to the force m1 g1 is m1 g 1x1 , where g 1 is the magnitude of the gravitational field
at the position of the particle of mass m 1. We wish to locate the center of gravity,
the point at which application of the single gravitational force Mg (where M 
m 1  m 2  m 3  . . . is the total mass of the object) has the same effect on rotation as does the combined effect of all the individual gravitational forces m i g i .
Equating the torque resulting from Mg acting at the center of gravity to the
sum of the torques acting on the individual particles gives
(m 1g 1  m 2g 2  m 3g 3 

)x CG  m 1g 1x 1  m 2g 2x 2  m 3g 3x 3 

Figure 12.6 The center of gravity
of an object is located at the center
of mass if g is constant over the
object.

This expression accounts for the fact that the gravitational ﬁeld strength g can in
general vary over the object. If we assume uniform g over the object (as is usually
the case), then the g terms cancel and we obtain
x CG 

m 1x 1  m 2x 2  m 3x 3 
m1  m2  m3 

(12.4)

Comparing this result with Equation 9.28, we see that the center of gravity is located at the center of mass as long as the object is in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld.
In several examples presented in the next section, we are concerned with homogeneous, symmetric objects. The center of gravity for any such object coincides
with its geometric center.

EXAMPLES OF RIGID OBJECTS
IN STATIC EQUILIBRIUM

The photograph of the one-bottle wine holder on the ﬁrst page of this chapter
shows one example of a balanced mechanical system that seems to defy gravity. For
the system (wine holder plus bottle) to be in equilibrium, the net external force
must be zero (see Eq. 12.1) and the net external torque must be zero (see Eq.
12.2). The second condition can be satisﬁed only when the center of gravity of the
system is directly over the support point.
In working static equilibrium problems, it is important to recognize all the external forces acting on the object. Failure to do so results in an incorrect analysis.
When analyzing an object in equilibrium under the action of several external
forces, use the following procedure.

CHAPTER 12

Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

Problem-Solving Hints
Objects in Static Equilibrium
• Draw a simple, neat diagram of the system.
• Isolate the object being analyzed. Draw a free-body diagram and then show
and label all external forces acting on the object, indicating where those
forces are applied. Do not include forces exerted by the object on its surroundings. (For systems that contain more than one object, draw a separate
free-body diagram for each one.) Try to guess the correct direction for each
force. If the direction you select leads to a negative force, do not be
alarmed; this merely means that the direction of the force is the opposite of
what you guessed.
• Establish a convenient coordinate system for the object and ﬁnd the components of the forces along the two axes. Then apply the ﬁrst condition for
equilibrium. Remember to keep track of the signs of all force components.
• Choose a convenient axis for calculating the net torque on the object. Remember that the choice of origin for the torque equation is arbitrary; therefore, choose an origin that simpliﬁes your calculation as much as possible.
Note that a force that acts along a line passing through the point chosen as
the origin gives zero contribution to the torque and thus can be ignored.

The ﬁrst and second conditions for equilibrium give a set of linear equations containing several unknowns, and these equations can be solved simultaneously.

A uniform 40.0-N board supports a father and daughter

EXAMPLE 12.2

A Weighted Hand

A person holds a 50.0-N sphere in his hand. The forearm is
horizontal, as shown in Figure 12.8a. The biceps muscle is attached 3.00 cm from the joint, and the sphere is 35.0 cm
from the joint. Find the upward force exerted by the biceps
on the forearm and the downward force exerted by the upper arm on the forearm and acting at the joint. Neglect the
weight of the forearm.

Solution We simplify the situation by modeling the forearm as a bar as shown in Figure 12.8b, where F is the upward
force exerted by the biceps and R is the downward force exerted by the upper arm at the joint. From the ﬁrst condition
for equilibrium, we have, with upward as the positive y direction,

Standing on a Horizontal Beam

A uniform horizontal beam with a length of 8.00 m and a
weight of 200 N is attached to a wall by a pin connection. Its far
end is supported by a cable that makes an angle of 53.0° with

the horizontal (Fig. 12.9a). If a 600-N person stands 2.00 m
from the wall, ﬁnd the tension in the cable, as well as the magnitude and direction of the force exerted by the wall on the beam.

CHAPTER 12

Static Equilibrium and Elasticity
the left end of the beam would probably move to the left as
it begins to fall. This tells us that the wall is not only holding the beam up but is also pressing outward against it.
Thus, we draw the vector R as shown in Figure 12.9b. If we
resolve T and R into horizontal and vertical components,
as shown in Figure 12.9c, and apply the first condition for
equilibrium, we obtain

where we have chosen rightward and upward as our positive
directions. Because R, T, and are all unknown, we cannot
obtain a solution from these expressions alone. (The number
of simultaneous equations must equal the number of unknowns for us to be able to solve for the unknowns.)
Now let us invoke the condition for rotational equilibrium. A convenient axis to choose for our torque equation is
the one that passes through the pin connection. The feature
that makes this point so convenient is that the force R and
the horizontal component of T both have a moment arm of
zero; hence, these forces provide no torque about this point.
Recalling our counterclockwise-equals-positive convention for
the sign of the torque about an axis and noting that the moment arms of the 600-N, 200-N, and T sin 53.0° forces are
2.00 m, 4.00 m, and 8.00 m, respectively, we obtain

beam showing the components of R and T.

Solution

Thus, the torque equation with this axis gives us one of the
unknowns directly! We now substitute this value into Equations (1) and (2) and ﬁnd that

First we must identify all the external forces
acting on the beam: They are the 200-N force of gravity, the
force T exerted by the cable, the force R exerted by the
wall at the pivot, and the 600-N force that the person exerts
on the beam. These forces are all indicated in the free-body
diagram for the beam shown in Figure 12.9b. When we consider directions for forces, it sometimes is helpful if we
imagine what would happen if a force were suddenly removed. For example, if the wall were to vanish suddenly,

R cos

12.3 Examples of Rigid Objects in Static Equilibrium
we had chosen an axis through the center of gravity of the
beam, the torque equation would involve both T and R. However, this equation, coupled with Equations (1) and (2),
could still be solved for the unknowns. Try it!
When many forces are involved in a problem of this nature, it is convenient to set up a table. For instance, for the
example just given, we could construct the following table.
Setting the sum of the terms in the last column equal to zero
represents the condition of rotational equilibrium.

The Leaning Ladder

A uniform ladder of length ᐍ and weight mg  50 N rests
against a smooth, vertical wall (Fig. 12.10a). If the coefﬁcient
of static friction between the ladder and the ground is s 
0.40, ﬁnd the minimum angle min at which the ladder does
not slip.

Solution The free-body diagram showing all the external
forces acting on the ladder is illustrated in Figure 12.10b.
The reaction force R exerted by the ground on the ladder is
the vector sum of a normal force n and the force of static friction fs . The reaction force P exerted by the wall on the ladder is horizontal because the wall is frictionless. Notice how
we have included only forces that act on the ladder. For example, the forces exerted by the ladder on the ground and
on the wall are not part of the problem and thus do not appear in the free-body diagram. Applying the ﬁrst condition

for equilibrium to the ladder, we have

Fx  f  P  0
 F y  n  mg  0
From the second equation we see that n  mg  50 N. Furthermore, when the ladder is on the verge of slipping, the
force of friction must be a maximum, which is given by
f s,max  sn  0.40(50 N)  20 N. (Recall Eq. 5.8: fs
s n.)
Thus, at this angle, P  20 N.
To ﬁnd min , we must use the second condition for equilibrium. When we take the torques about an axis through the
origin O at the bottom of the ladder, we have

An alternative approach is to consider the intersection O
of the lines of action of forces mg and P. Because the torque
about any origin must be zero, the torque about O must be
zero. This requires that the line of action of R (the resultant
of n and f ) pass through O. In other words, because the ladder is stationary, the three forces acting on it must all pass
through some common point. (We say that such forces are
concurrent.) With this condition, you could then obtain the
angle  that R makes with the horizontal (where  is greater
than ). Because this approach depends on the length of the
ladder, you would have to know the value of ᐍ to obtain a
value for min .

EXAMPLE 12.5

Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

Negotiating a Curb

(a) Estimate the magnitude of the force F a person must apply to a wheelchair’s main wheel to roll up over a sidewalk
curb (Fig. 12.11a). This main wheel, which is the one that
comes in contact with the curb, has a radius r, and the height
of the curb is h.

Solution Normally, the person’s hands supply the required force to a slightly smaller wheel that is concentric with
the main wheel. We assume that the radius of the smaller
wheel is the same as the radius of the main wheel, and so we
can use r for our radius. Let us estimate a combined weight
of mg  1 400 N for the person and the wheelchair and
choose a wheel radius of r  30 cm, as shown in Figure
12.11b. We also pick a curb height of h  10 cm. We assume
that the wheelchair and occupant are symmetric, and that
each wheel supports a weight of 700 N. We then proceed to
analyze only one of the wheels.
When the wheel is just about to be raised from the street,
the reaction force exerted by the ground on the wheel at
point Q goes to zero. Hence, at this time only three forces act
on the wheel, as shown in Figure 12.11c. However, the force
R, which is the force exerted on the wheel by the curb, acts at
point P, and so if we choose to have our axis of rotation pass
through point P, we do not need to include R in our torque
equation. From the triangle OPQ shown in Figure 12.11b, we
see that the moment arm d of the gravitational force mg acting on the wheel relative to point P is

Although we could repeat the torque calculation for the right
end (point E), it should be clear from symmetry arguments
that nA  3 600 N.
Now let us balance the vertical forces acting on the pin at
point A. If we assume that strut AB is in compression, then
the force FAB that the strut exerts on the pin at point A has a
negative y component. (If the strut is actually in tension, our
calculations will result in a negative value for the magnitude
of the force, still of the correct size):

 F y  n A  F AB sin 30

0

F AB  7 200 N

The positive result shows that our assumption of compression
was correct.
We can now ﬁnd the forces acting in the strut between A
and C by considering the horizontal forces acting on the pin
at point A. Because point A is not accelerating, we can safely
assume that FAC must point toward the right (Fig. 12.12b);
this indicates that the bar between points A and C is under
tension:
 F x  F AC  F AB cos 30  0
Now let us consider the vertical forces acting on the pin at
point C. We shall assume that strut BC is in tension. (Imagine
the subsequent motion of the pin at point C if strut BC were
to break suddenly.) On the basis of symmetry, we assert that

Solve this problem by noting that the three forces
acting on the wheel are concurrent (that is, that all three pass
through the point C). The three forces form the sides of the
triangle shown in Figure 12.11d.

Analysis of a Truss

Roofs, bridges, and other structures that must be both strong
and lightweight often are made of trusses similar to the one
shown in Figure 12.12a. Imagine that this truss structure represents part of a bridge. To approach this problem, we assume
that the structural components are connected by pin joints. We
also assume that the entire structure is free to slide horizontally because it sits on “rockers” on each end, which allow it to
move back and forth as it undergoes thermal expansion and
contraction. Assuming the mass of the bridge structure is negligible compared with the load, let us calculate the forces of tension or compression in all the structural components when it is
supporting a 7 200-N load at the center (see Problem 58).
The force notation that we use here is not of our usual format. Until now, we have used the notation FAB to mean “the
force exerted by A on B.” For this application, however, all
double-letter subscripts on F indicate only the body exerting
the force. The body on which a given force acts is not named
in the subscript. For example, in Figure 12.12, FAB is the force
exerted by strut AB on the pin at A.
First, we apply Newton’s second law to the truss as a whole
in the vertical direction. Internal forces do not enter into this
accounting. We balance the weight of the load with the normal forces exerted at the two ends by the supports on which
the bridge rests:

CHAPTER 12

12.4

Static Equilibrium and Elasticity

ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

In our study of mechanics thus far, we have assumed that objects remain undeformed when external forces act on them. In reality, all objects are deformable.
That is, it is possible to change the shape or the size of an object (or both) by applying external forces. As these changes take place, however, internal forces in the
object resist the deformation.
We shall discuss the deformation of solids in terms of the concepts of stress
and strain. Stress is a quantity that is proportional to the force causing a deformation; more speciﬁcally, stress is the external force acting on an object per unit
cross-sectional area. Strain is a measure of the degree of deformation. It is found
that, for sufﬁciently small stresses, strain is proportional to stress; the constant
of proportionality depends on the material being deformed and on the nature of
the deformation. We call this proportionality constant the elastic modulus. The
elastic modulus is therefore the ratio of the stress to the resulting strain:
Elastic modulus ⬅

stress
strain

(12.5)

In a very real sense it is a comparison of what is done to a solid object (a force is
applied) and how that object responds (it deforms to some extent).

where the stresses are greatest. Such models are useful in designing architectural components.

373

12.4 Elastic Properties of Solids

We consider three types of deformation and deﬁne an elastic modulus for each:
1. Young’s modulus, which measures the resistance of a solid to a change in its
length
2. Shear modulus, which measures the resistance to motion of the planes of a
solid sliding past each other
3. Bulk modulus, which measures the resistance of solids or liquids to changes
in their volume
Li

Young’s Modulus: Elasticity in Length
Consider a long bar of cross-sectional area A and initial length L i that is clamped
at one end, as in Figure 12.13. When an external force is applied perpendicular to
the cross section, internal forces in the bar resist distortion (“stretching”), but the
bar attains an equilibrium in which its length Lf is greater than L i and in which
the external force is exactly balanced by internal forces. In such a situation, the
bar is said to be stressed. We deﬁne the tensile stress as the ratio of the magnitude of the external force F to the cross-sectional area A. The tensile strain in this
case is deﬁned as the ratio of the change in length L to the original length L i .
We deﬁne Young’s modulus by a combination of these two ratios:
Y

F/A
tensile stress

tensile strain
L/L i

(12.6)

Young’s modulus is typically used to characterize a rod or wire stressed under either tension or compression. Note that because strain is a dimensionless quantity,
Y has units of force per unit area. Typical values are given in Table 12.1. Experiments show (a) that for a ﬁxed applied force, the change in length is proportional
to the original length and (b) that the force necessary to produce a given strain is
proportional to the cross-sectional area. Both of these observations are in accord
with Equation 12.6.
The elastic limit of a substance is deﬁned as the maximum stress that can be
applied to the substance before it becomes permanently deformed. It is possible to
exceed the elastic limit of a substance by applying a sufﬁciently large stress, as seen
in Figure 12.14. Initially, a stress – strain curve is a straight line. As the stress increases, however, the curve is no longer straight. When the stress exceeds the elas-

block is distorted by two forces of

faces. (b) A book under shear
stress.

Shear Modulus: Elasticity of Shape
Another type of deformation occurs when an object is subjected to a force tangential to one of its faces while the opposite face is held ﬁxed by another force (Fig.
12.15a). The stress in this case is called a shear stress. If the object is originally a
rectangular block, a shear stress results in a shape whose cross-section is a parallelogram. A book pushed sideways, as shown in Figure 12.15b, is an example of an
object subjected to a shear stress. To a ﬁrst approximation (for small distortions),
no change in volume occurs with this deformation.
We deﬁne the shear stress as F/A, the ratio of the tangential force to the area
A of the face being sheared. The shear strain is deﬁned as the ratio x/h, where
x is the horizontal distance that the sheared face moves and h is the height of the
object. In terms of these quantities, the shear modulus is

Values of the shear modulus for some representative materials are given in
Table 12.1. The unit of shear modulus is force per unit area.

Bulk modulus

Bulk modulus characterizes the response of a substance to uniform squeezing or
to a reduction in pressure when the object is placed in a partial vacuum. Suppose
that the external forces acting on an object are at right angles to all its faces, as
shown in Figure 12.16, and that they are distributed uniformly over all the faces.
As we shall see in Chapter 15, such a uniform distribution of forces occurs when
an object is immersed in a ﬂuid. An object subject to this type of deformation undergoes a change in volume but no change in shape. The volume stress is deﬁned as the ratio of the magnitude of the normal force F to the area A. The quantity P  F/A is called the pressure. If the pressure on an object changes by an
amount P  F/A, then the object will experience a volume change V. The volume strain is equal to the change in volume V divided by the initial volume Vi .
Thus, from Equation 12.5, we can characterize a volume (“bulk”) compression in
terms of the bulk modulus, which is deﬁned as

When a solid is under uniform pressure, it
undergoes a change in volume but no change in shape.
This cube is compressed on all sides by forces normal to its
six faces.

A negative sign is inserted in this deﬁning equation so that B is a positive number.
This maneuver is necessary because an increase in pressure (positive P ) causes a
decrease in volume (negative V ) and vice versa.
Table 12.1 lists bulk moduli for some materials. If you look up such values in a
different source, you often ﬁnd that the reciprocal of the bulk modulus is listed.
The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called the compressibility of the material.
Note from Table 12.1 that both solids and liquids have a bulk modulus. However, no shear modulus and no Young’s modulus are given for liquids because a
liquid does not sustain a shearing stress or a tensile stress (it ﬂows instead).

Prestressed Concrete
If the stress on a solid object exceeds a certain value, the object fractures. The
maximum stress that can be applied before fracture occurs depends on the nature
of the material and on the type of applied stress. For example, concrete has a tensile strength of about 2  106 N/m2, a compressive strength of 20  106 N/m2,
and a shear strength of 2  106 N/m2. If the applied stress exceeds these values,
the concrete fractures. It is common practice to use large safety factors to prevent
failure in concrete structures.
Concrete is normally very brittle when it is cast in thin sections. Thus, concrete
slabs tend to sag and crack at unsupported areas, as shown in Figure 12.17a. The
slab can be strengthened by the use of steel rods to reinforce the concrete, as illustrated in Figure 12.17b. Because concrete is much stronger under compression
(squeezing) than under tension (stretching) or shear, vertical columns of concrete
can support very heavy loads, whereas horizontal beams of concrete tend to sag
and crack. However, a signiﬁcant increase in shear strength is achieved if the reinforced concrete is prestressed, as shown in Figure 12.17c. As the concrete is being
poured, the steel rods are held under tension by external forces. The external

forces are released after the concrete cures; this results in a permanent tension in
the steel and hence a compressive stress on the concrete. This enables the concrete slab to support a much heavier load.

Recall Example 8.10, in which we analyzed a cable used to
support an actor as he swung onto the stage. The tension in
the cable was 940 N. What diameter should a 10-m-long steel
wire have if we do not want it to stretch more than 0.5 cm under these conditions?

Problems

The force of gravity exerted on an object can be considered as acting at a single point called the center of gravity. The center of gravity of an object coincides
with its center of mass if the object is in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld.
We can describe the elastic properties of a substance using the concepts of
stress and strain. Stress is a quantity proportional to the force producing a deformation; strain is a measure of the degree of deformation. Strain is proportional to
stress, and the constant of proportionality is the elastic modulus:

Three common types of deformation are (1) the resistance of a solid to elongation under a load, characterized by Young’s modulus Y ; (2) the resistance of a
solid to the motion of internal planes sliding past each other, characterized by the
shear modulus S ; and (3) the resistance of a solid or ﬂuid to a volume change,
characterized by the bulk modulus B.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
12.1 (a) Yes, as Figure 12.3 shows. The unbalanced torques
cause an angular acceleration even though the linear acceleration is zero. (b) Yes, again. This happens when the
lines of action of all the forces intersect at a common
point. If a net force acts on the object, then the object
has a translational acceleration. However, because there
is no net torque on the object, the object has no angular
acceleration. There are other instances in which torques
cancel but the forces do not. You should be able to draw
at least two.
12.2 The location of the board’s center of gravity relative to
the fulcrum.

12.3 Young’s modulus is given by the ratio of stress to strain,
which is the slope of the elastic behavior section of the
graph in Figure 12.14. Reading from the graph, we note
that a stress of approximately 3  108 N/m2 results in a
strain of 0.003. The slope, and hence Young’s modulus,
are therefore 10  1010 N/m2.
12.4 A substantial part of the graph extends beyond the elastic limit, indicating permanent deformation. Thus, the
material is ductile.

CHAPTER 13

Oscillatory Motion

A

very special kind of motion occurs when the force acting on a body is proportional to the displacement of the body from some equilibrium position. If
this force is always directed toward the equilibrium position, repetitive backand-forth motion occurs about this position. Such motion is called periodic motion,
harmonic motion, oscillation, or vibration (the four terms are completely equivalent).
You are most likely familiar with several examples of periodic motion, such as
the oscillations of a block attached to a spring, the swinging of a child on a playground swing, the motion of a pendulum, and the vibrations of a stringed musical
instrument. In addition to these everyday examples, numerous other systems exhibit periodic motion. For example, the molecules in a solid oscillate about their
equilibrium positions; electromagnetic waves, such as light waves, radar, and radio
waves, are characterized by oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors; and in
alternating-current electrical circuits, voltage, current, and electrical charge vary
periodically with time.
Most of the material in this chapter deals with simple harmonic motion, in which
an object oscillates such that its position is speciﬁed by a sinusoidal function of
time with no loss in mechanical energy. In real mechanical systems, damping (frictional) forces are often present. These forces are considered in optional Section
13.6 at the end of this chapter.

Figure 13.1 A block attached to
a spring moving on a frictionless
surface. (a) When the block is displaced to the right of equilibrium
(x  0), the force exerted by the
spring acts to the left. (b) When
the block is at its equilibrium position (x  0), the force exerted by
the spring is zero. (c) When the
block is displaced to the left of
equilibrium (x  0), the force exerted by the spring acts to the
right.

Consider a physical system that consists of a block of mass m attached to the end of a
spring, with the block free to move on a horizontal, frictionless surface (Fig. 13.1).
When the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, the block is at the position
x  0, called the equilibrium position of the system. We know from experience that
such a system oscillates back and forth if disturbed from its equilibrium position.
We can understand the motion in Figure 13.1 qualitatively by ﬁrst recalling
that when the block is displaced a small distance x from equilibrium, the spring
exerts on the block a force that is proportional to the displacement and given by
Hooke’s law (see Section 7.3):

SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

(13.1)

We call this a restoring force because it is is always directed toward the equilibrium position and therefore opposite the displacement. That is, when the block is
displaced to the right of x  0 in Figure 13.1, then the displacement is positive
and the restoring force is directed to the left. When the block is displaced to the
left of x  0, then the displacement is negative and the restoring force is directed
to the right.
Applying Newton’s second law to the motion of the block, together with Equation 13.1, we obtain
F s  kx  ma
a

k

m

(13.2)

That is, the acceleration is proportional to the displacement of the block, and its
direction is opposite the direction of the displacement. Systems that behave in this
way are said to exhibit simple harmonic motion. An object moves with simple
harmonic motion whenever its acceleration is proportional to its displacement from some equilibrium position and is oppositely directed.

An experimental arrangement that exhibits simple harmonic motion is illustrated in Figure 13.2. A mass oscillating vertically on a spring has a pen attached to
it. While the mass is oscillating, a sheet of paper is moved perpendicular to the direction of motion of the spring, and the pen traces out a wavelike pattern.
In general, a particle moving along the x axis exhibits simple harmonic motion when x, the particle’s displacement from equilibrium, varies in time according
to the relationship
x  A cos(t  )

where A, , and  are constants. To give physical signiﬁcance to these constants,
we have labeled a plot of x as a function of t in Figure 13.3a. This is just the pattern
that is observed with the experimental apparatus shown in Figure 13.2. The amplitude A of the motion is the maximum displacement of the particle in either the
positive or negative x direction. The constant  is called the angular frequency of
the motion and has units of radians per second. (We shall discuss the geometric
signiﬁcance of  in Section 13.2.) The constant angle , called the phase constant (or phase angle), is determined by the initial displacement and velocity of
the particle. If the particle is at its maximum position x  A at t  0, then   0
and the curve of x versus t is as shown in Figure 13.3b. If the particle is at some
other position at t  0, the constants  and A tell us what the position was at time
t  0. The quantity (t  ) is called the phase of the motion and is useful in comparing the motions of two oscillators.
Note from Equation 13.3 that the trigonometric function x is periodic and repeats itself every time t increases by 2 rad. The period T of the motion is the
time it takes for the particle to go through one full cycle. We say that the particle has made one oscillation. This deﬁnition of T tells us that the value of x at time
t equals the value of x at time t  T. We can show that T  2/ by using the preceding observation that the phase (t  ) increases by 2 rad in a time T :

side in simple harmonic motion, with one having been released later than the
other. The pendulum bobs have different phase constants. Let us show how the
phase constant and the amplitude of any particle moving in simple harmonic motion can be determined if we know the particle’s initial speed and position and the
angular frequency of its motion.
Suppose that at t  0 the initial position of a single oscillator is x  x i and its

Oscillatory Motion

The following properties of a particle moving in simple harmonic motion are
important:
• The acceleration of the particle is proportional to the displacement but is in the

opposite direction. This is the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for simple harmonic
motion, as opposed to all other kinds of vibration.
• The displacement from the equilibrium position, velocity, and acceleration all
vary sinusoidally with time but are not in phase, as shown in Figure 13.4.
• The frequency and the period of the motion are independent of the amplitude.
(We show this explicitly in the next section.)

THE BLOCK – SPRING SYSTEM REVISITED

Let us return to the block – spring system (Fig. 13.5). Again we assume that the surface is frictionless; hence, when the block is displaced from equilibrium, the only
force acting on it is the restoring force of the spring. As we saw in Equation 13.2,
when the block is displaced a distance x from equilibrium, it experiences an acceleration a  (k/m)x. If the block is displaced a maximum distance x  A at some
initial time and then released from rest, its initial acceleration at that instant is
 kA/m (its extreme negative value). When the block passes through the equilibrium position x  0, its acceleration is zero. At this instant, its speed is a maximum. The block then continues to travel to the left of equilibrium and ﬁnally
reaches x  A, at which time its acceleration is kA/m (maximum positive) and
its speed is again zero. Thus, we see that the block oscillates between the turning
points x  A.
Let us now describe the oscillating motion in a quantitative fashion. Recall
that a  dv/dt  d 2x/dt 2, and so we can express Equation 13.2 as
d 2x
dt 2



If we denote the ratio k/m with the symbol  2, this equation becomes
d 2x
   2x
dt 2

(13.17)

Now we require a solution to Equation 13.17 — that is, a function x(t) that satisﬁes this second-order differential equation. Because Equations 13.17 and 13.9
are equivalent, each solution must be that of simple harmonic motion:
x  A cos(t  )
To see this explicitly, assume that x  A cos(t  ). Then

Comparing the expressions for x and d 2x/dt 2, we see that d 2x/dt 2    2x, and
Equation 13.17 is satisﬁed. We conclude that whenever the force acting on a

Recall that the period of any simple harmonic oscillator is T  2/ (Eq.
13.4) and that the frequency is the inverse of the period. We know from Equations
13.16 and 13.17 that   √k/m , so we can express the period and frequency of the
block – spring system as

Now tie four identical rubber bands
together, end to end. How should k
for this longer band compare with k

That is, the frequency and period depend only on the mass of the block and
on the force constant of the spring. Furthermore, the frequency and period are
independent of the amplitude of the motion. As we might expect, the frequency is
greater for a stiffer spring (the stiffer the spring, the greater the value of k) and
decreases with increasing mass.
Special Case 1. Let us consider a special case to better understand the physical significance of Equation 13.3, the defining expression for simple harmonic
motion. We shall use this equation to describe the motion of an oscillating
block – spring system. Suppose we pull the block a distance A from equilibrium
and then release it from rest at this stretched position, as shown in Figure 13.6.
Our solution for x must obey the initial conditions that x i  A and v i  0 at
t  0. It does if we choose   0, which gives x  A cos  t as the solution. To
check this solution, we note that it satisfies the condition that x i  A at t  0 because cos 0  1. Thus, we see that A and  contain the information on initial
conditions.
Now let us investigate the behavior of the velocity and acceleration for this
special case. Because x  A cos t,

require. The expression for the acceleration tells us that a    2A at t  0. Physically, this negative acceleration makes sense because the force acting on the block
is directed to the left when the displacement is positive. In fact, at the extreme pox=0

sition shown in Figure 13.6, F s  kA (to the left) and the initial acceleration is
  2A  kA/m.
Another approach to showing that x  A cos  t is the correct solution involves
using the relationship tan   v i /x i (Eq. 13.14). Because v i  0 at t  0,
tan   0 and thus   0. (The tangent of  also equals zero, but    gives the
wrong value for x i .)
Figure 13.7 is a plot of displacement, velocity, and acceleration versus time for
this special case. Note that the acceleration reaches extreme values of  2A while
the displacement has extreme values of A because the force is maximal at those
positions. Furthermore, the velocity has extreme values of A, which both occur
at x  0. Hence, the quantitative solution agrees with our qualitative description
of this system.
Special Case 2. Now suppose that the block is given an initial velocity vi to the
right at the instant it is at the equilibrium position, so that x i  0 and v  v i at
t  0 (Fig. 13.8). The expression for x must now satisfy these initial conditions. Because the block is moving in the positive x direction at t  0 and because x i  0 at
t  0, the expression for x must have the form x  A sin t.
Applying Equation 13.14 and the initial condition that x i  0 at t  0, we
ﬁnd that tan    and    /2. Hence, Equation 13.3 becomes x 

Kinetic energy of a simple

The elastic potential energy stored in the spring for any elongation x is given
by 12 kx 2 (see Eq. 8.4). Using Equation 13.3, we obtain
U  12 kx 2  12 kA2 cos2(t  )

Potential energy of a simple
harmonic oscillator

We see that K and U are always positive quantities. Because  2  k/m, we can express the total mechanical energy of the simple harmonic oscillator as
E  K  U  12 kA2[sin2(t  )  cos2(t  )]
From the identity sin2   cos2   1, we see that the quantity in square brackets is
unity. Therefore, this equation reduces to
E  12 kA2

(13.22)

That is, the total mechanical energy of a simple harmonic oscillator is a constant of the motion and is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Note
that U is small when K is large, and vice versa, because the sum must be constant.
In fact, the total mechanical energy is equal to the maximum potential energy
stored in the spring when x  A because v  0 at these points and thus there is
no kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position, where U  0 because x  0, the total energy, all in the form of kinetic energy, is again 21 kA2. That is,

You may wonder why we are spending so much time studying simple harmonic
oscillators. We do so because they are good models of a wide variety of physical
phenomena. For example, recall the Lennard – Jones potential discussed in Example 8.11. This complicated function describes the forces holding atoms together.
Figure 13.11a shows that, for small displacements from the equilibrium position,
the potential energy curve for this function approximates a parabola, which represents the potential energy function for a simple harmonic oscillator. Thus, we can
approximate the complex atomic binding forces as tiny springs, as depicted in Figure 13.11b.
The ideas presented in this chapter apply not only to block – spring systems
and atoms, but also to a wide range of situations that include bungee jumping,
tuning in a television station, and viewing the light emitted by a laser. You will see
more examples of simple harmonic oscillators as you work through this book.

When  is small, a

tangent to the arc.

THE PENDULUM

The simple pendulum is another mechanical system that exhibits periodic motion. It consists of a particle-like bob of mass m suspended by a light string of
length L that is ﬁxed at the upper end, as shown in Figure 13.12. The motion occurs in the vertical plane and is driven by the force of gravity. We shall show that,
provided the angle  is small (less than about 10°), the motion is that of a simple
harmonic oscillator.
The forces acting on the bob are the force T exerted by the string and the
gravitational force mg. The tangential component of the gravitational force,
mg sin , always acts toward   0, opposite the displacement. Therefore, the tangential force is a restoring force, and we can apply Newton’s second law for motion in the tangential direction:

use the approximation sin  ⬇  ; thus the equation of motion for the simple pen-

The Foucault pendulum at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. This type of pendulum was ﬁrst
used by the French physicist Jean Foucault to verify the Earth’s rotation experimentally. As the
pendulum swings, the vertical plane in which it oscillates appears to rotate as the bob successively
knocks over the indicators arranged in a circle on the ﬂoor. In reality, the plane of oscillation is
ﬁxed in space, and the Earth rotating beneath the swinging pendulum moves the indicators into
position to be knocked down, one after the other.

In other words, the period and frequency of a simple pendulum depend only
on the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity. Because the
period is independent of the mass, we conclude that all simple pendulums that are
of equal length and are at the same location (so that g is constant) oscillate with
the same period. The analogy between the motion of a simple pendulum and that
of a block – spring system is illustrated in Figure 13.10.
The simple pendulum can be used as a timekeeper because its period depends
only on its length and the local value of g. It is also a convenient device for making
precise measurements of the free-fall acceleration. Such measurements are important because variations in local values of g can provide information on the location
of oil and of other valuable underground resources.

Quick Quiz 13.5
A block of mass m is ﬁrst allowed to hang from a spring in static equilibrium. It stretches the
spring a distance L beyond the spring’s unstressed length. The block and spring are then
set into oscillation. Is the period of this system less than, equal to, or greater than the period of a simple pendulum having a length L and a bob mass m?

EXAMPLE 13.5

A Connection Between Length and Time

Christian Huygens (1629 – 1695), the greatest clockmaker in
history, suggested that an international unit of length could
be deﬁned as the length of a simple pendulum having a period of exactly 1 s. How much shorter would our length unit
be had his suggestion been followed?

Solution
L

Thus, the meter’s length would be slightly less than onefourth its current length. Note that the number of signiﬁcant
digits depends only on how precisely we know g because the
time has been deﬁned to be exactly 1 s.

Firmly hold a ruler so that about half
of it is over the edge of your desk.
With your other hand, pull down and
then release the free end, watching
how it vibrates. Now slide the ruler so
that only about a quarter of it is free
to vibrate. This time when you release
it, how does the vibrational period
compare with its earlier value? Why?

Suppose you balance a wire coat hanger so that the hook is supported by your extended index ﬁnger. When you give the hanger a small displacement (with your
other hand) and then release it, it oscillates. If a hanging object oscillates about a
ﬁxed axis that does not pass through its center of mass and the object cannot be
approximated as a point mass, we cannot treat the system as a simple pendulum.
In this case the system is called a physical pendulum.
Consider a rigid body pivoted at a point O that is a distance d from the center
of mass (Fig. 13.13). The force of gravity provides a torque about an axis through
O, and the magnitude of that torque is mgd sin , where  is as shown in Figure
13.13. Using the law of motion   I, where I is the moment of inertia about

The minus sign indicates that the torque about O tends to decrease . That is, the
force of gravity produces a restoring torque. Because this equation gives us the
angular acceleration d 2 /dt 2 of the pivoted body, we can consider it the equation
of motion for the system. If we again assume that  is small, the approximation

COMPARING SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION WITH
UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

We can better understand and visualize many aspects of simple harmonic motion
by studying its relationship to uniform circular motion. Figure 13.17 is an overhead view of an experimental arrangement that shows this relationship. A ball is
attached to the rim of a turntable of radius A, which is illuminated from the side
by a lamp. The ball casts a shadow on a screen. We ﬁnd that as the turntable rotates with constant angular speed, the shadow of the ball moves back and forth in
simple harmonic motion.

13.5 Comparing Simple Harmonic Motion with Uniform Circular Motion

Consider a particle located at point P on the circumference of a circle of radius A, as shown in Figure 13.18a, with the line OP making an angle  with the x
axis at t  0. We call this circle a reference circle for comparing simple harmonic motion and uniform circular motion, and we take the position of P at t  0 as our reference position. If the particle moves along the circle with constant angular speed
 until OP makes an angle  with the x axis, as illustrated in Figure 13.18b, then at
some time t  0, the angle between OP and the x axis is   t  . As the particle moves along the circle, the projection of P on the x axis, labeled point Q ,
moves back and forth along the x axis, between the limits x  A.
Note that points P and Q always have the same x coordinate. From the right
triangle OPQ , we see that this x coordinate is

This expression shows that the point Q moves with simple harmonic motion along

simple harmonic motion along a straight line can be represented by the projection of uniform circular motion along a diameter of a reference circle.
We can make a similar argument by noting from Figure 13.18b that the projection of P along the y axis also exhibits simple harmonic motion. Therefore, uniform circular motion can be considered a combination of two simple harmonic motions, one along the x axis and one along the y axis, with the two
differing in phase by 90°.
This geometric interpretation shows that the time for one complete revolution
of the point P on the reference circle is equal to the period of motion T for simple
harmonic motion between x  A. That is, the angular speed  of P is the same
as the angular frequency  of simple harmonic motion along the x axis (this is why
we use the same symbol). The phase constant  for simple harmonic motion corresponds to the initial angle that OP makes with the x axis. The radius A of the reference circle equals the amplitude of the simple harmonic motion.

Oscillatory Motion

Because the relationship between linear and angular speed for circular motion is v  r (see Eq. 10.10), the particle moving on the reference circle of radius
A has a velocity of magnitude A. From the geometry in Figure 13.18c, we see that
the x component of this velocity is  A sin(t   ). By deﬁnition, the point Q
has a velocity given by dx/dt. Differentiating Equation 13.31 with respect to time,
we ﬁnd that the velocity of Q is the same as the x component of the velocity of P.
The acceleration of P on the reference circle is directed radially inward toward
O and has a magnitude v 2/A   2A. From the geometry in Figure 13.18d, we see
that the x component of this acceleration is   2A cos(t  ). This value is also
the acceleration of the projected point Q along the x axis, as you can verify by taking the second derivative of Equation 13.31.

If we were to take our answer as   48.2°, then the coordinate x  (3.00 m) cos (8.00t  48.2°) would be decreasing at
time t  0 (that is, moving to the left). Because our particle is

DAMPED OSCILLATIONS

The oscillatory motions we have considered so far have been for ideal systems —
that is, systems that oscillate indeﬁnitely under the action of a linear restoring
force. In many real systems, dissipative forces, such as friction, retard the motion.
Consequently, the mechanical energy of the system diminishes in time, and the
motion is said to be damped.
One common type of retarding force is the one discussed in Section 6.4,
where the force is proportional to the speed of the moving object and acts in the
direction opposite the motion. This retarding force is often observed when an object moves through air, for instance. Because the retarding force can be expressed
as R   b v (where b is a constant called the damping coefﬁcient) and the restoring

The solution of this equation requires mathematics that may not be familiar to you
yet; we simply state it here without proof. When the retarding force is small compared with the maximum restoring force — that is, when b is small — the solution
to Equation 13.32 is

This result can be veriﬁed by substituting Equation 13.33 into Equation 13.32.
Figure 13.19a shows the displacement as a function of time for an object oscillating in the presence of a retarding force, and Figure 13.19b depicts one such system: a block attached to a spring and submersed in a viscous liquid. We see that
when the retarding force is much smaller than the restoring force, the oscillatory character of the motion is preserved but the amplitude decreases in
time, with the result that the motion ultimately ceases. Any system that behaves in this way is known as a damped oscillator. The dashed blue lines in Figure 13.19a, which deﬁne the envelope of the oscillatory curve, represent the exponential factor in Equation 13.33. This envelope shows that the amplitude decays
exponentially with time. For motion with a given spring constant and block
mass, the oscillations dampen more rapidly as the maximum value of the retarding
force approaches the maximum value of the restoring force.
It is convenient to express the angular frequency of a damped oscillator in the
form

冢 冣

where  0  √k/m represents the angular frequency in the absence of a retarding
force (the undamped oscillator) and is called the natural frequency of the system. When the magnitude of the maximum retarding force R max  bv max  kA,
the system is said to be underdamped. As the value of R approaches kA, the amplitudes of the oscillations decrease more and more rapidly. This motion is represented by the blue curve in Figure 13.20. When b reaches a critical value bc such
that bc /2m   0 , the system does not oscillate and is said to be critically damped.
In this case the system, once released from rest at some nonequilibrium position,
returns to equilibrium and then stays there. The graph of displacement versus
time for this case is the red curve in Figure 13.20.
If the medium is so viscous that the retarding force is greater than the restoring force — that is, if R max  bv max  kA and b/2m   0 —the system is overdamped. Again, the displaced system, when free to move, does not oscillate but
simply returns to its equilibrium position. As the damping increases, the time it
takes the system to approach equilibrium also increases, as indicated by the black
curve in Figure 13.20.
In any case in which friction is present, whether the system is overdamped or
underdamped, the energy of the oscillator eventually falls to zero. The lost mechanical energy dissipates into internal energy in the retarding medium.

FORCED OSCILLATIONS

It is possible to compensate for energy loss in a damped system by applying an external force that does positive work on the system. At any instant, energy can be
put into the system by an applied force that acts in the direction of motion of the
oscillator. For example, a child on a swing can be kept in motion by appropriately
timed pushes. The amplitude of motion remains constant if the energy input per
cycle exactly equals the energy lost as a result of damping. Any motion of this type
is called forced oscillation.
A common example of a forced oscillator is a damped oscillator driven by an
external force that varies periodically, such as F  F ext cos t, where  is the angular frequency of the periodic force and Fext is a constant. Adding this driving force
to the left side of Equation 13.32 gives

(13.35)

(As earlier, we present the solution of this equation without proof.) After a sufﬁciently long period of time, when the energy input per cycle equals the energy lost
per cycle, a steady-state condition is reached in which the oscillations proceed with
constant amplitude. At this time, when the system is in a steady state, the solution
of Equation 13.35 is
x  A cos(t  )

and where  0  √k/m is the angular frequency of the undamped oscillator (b  0).
One could argue that in steady state the oscillator must physically have the same frequency as the driving force, and thus the solution given by Equation 13.36 is expected. In fact, when this solution is substituted into Equation 13.35, one ﬁnds that
it is indeed a solution, provided the amplitude is given by Equation 13.37.
Equation 13.37 shows that, because an external force is driving it, the motion
of the forced oscillator is not damped. The external agent provides the necessary
energy to overcome the losses due to the retarding force. Note that the system oscillates at the angular frequency  of the driving force. For small damping, the amplitude becomes very large when the frequency of the driving force is near the natural frequency of oscillation. The dramatic increase in amplitude near the natural
frequency  0 is called resonance, and for this reason  0 is sometimes called the
resonance frequency of the system.
The reason for large-amplitude oscillations at the resonance frequency is that
energy is being transferred to the system under the most favorable conditions. We
can better understand this by taking the ﬁrst time derivative of x in Equation
13.36, which gives an expression for the velocity of the oscillator. We ﬁnd that v is
proportional to sin(t  ). When the applied force F is in phase with the velocity, the rate at which work is done on the oscillator by F equals the dot product
F ⴢ v. Remember that “rate at which work is done” is the deﬁnition of power. Because the product F ⴢ v is a maximum when F and v are in phase, we conclude that
at resonance the applied force is in phase with the velocity and that the
power transferred to the oscillator is a maximum.
Figure 13.22 is a graph of amplitude as a function of frequency for a forced oscillator with and without damping. Note that the amplitude increases with decreasing damping (b : 0) and that the resonance curve broadens as the damping increases. Under steady-state conditions and at any driving frequency, the energy
transferred into the system equals the energy lost because of the damping force;
hence, the average total energy of the oscillator remains constant. In the absence
of a damping force (b  0), we see from Equation 13.37 that the steady-state amplitude approaches inﬁnity as  :  0 . In other words, if there are no losses in the
system and if we continue to drive an initially motionless oscillator with a periodic
force that is in phase with the velocity, the amplitude of motion builds without
limit (see the red curve in Fig. 13.22). This limitless building does not occur in
practice because some damping is always present.
The behavior of a driven oscillating system after the driving force is removed
depends on b and on how close  was to  0 . This behavior is sometimes quantiﬁed
by a parameter called the quality factor Q. The closer a system is to being undamped, the greater its Q. The amplitude of oscillation drops by a factor of
e (2.718 . . . ) in Q/ cycles.
Later in this book we shall see that resonance appears in other areas of physics.
For example, certain electrical circuits have natural frequencies. A bridge has natural frequencies that can be set into resonance by an appropriate driving force. A
dramatic example of such resonance occurred in 1940, when the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge in the state of Washington was destroyed by resonant vibrations. Although
the winds were not particularly strong on that occasion, the bridge ultimately collapsed (Fig. 13.23) because the bridge design had no built-in safety features.

Bridge, causing it to oscillate at a frequency near one of the natural frequencies of the bridge

Many other examples of resonant vibrations can be cited. A resonant vibration
that you may have experienced is the “singing” of telephone wires in the wind. Machines often break if one vibrating part is at resonance with some other moving
part. Soldiers marching in cadence across a bridge have been known to set up resonant vibrations in the structure and thereby cause it to collapse. Whenever any
real physical system is driven near its resonance frequency, you can expect oscillations of very large amplitudes.

SUMMARY
When the acceleration of an object is proportional to its displacement from some
equilibrium position and is in the direction opposite the displacement, the object
moves with simple harmonic motion. The position x of a simple harmonic oscillator varies periodically in time according to the expression
x  A cos(t  )

(13.3)

where A is the amplitude of the motion,  is the angular frequency, and  is the
phase constant. The value of  depends on the initial position and initial velocity
of the oscillator. You should be able to use this formula to describe the motion of
an object undergoing simple harmonic motion.
The time T needed for one complete oscillation is deﬁned as the period of
the motion:

Thus, the maximum speed is A, and the maximum acceleration is  2A. The speed
is zero when the oscillator is at its turning points, x  A, and is a maximum when
the oscillator is at the equilibrium position x  0. The magnitude of the acceleration is a maximum at the turning points and zero at the equilibrium position. You
should be able to ﬁnd the velocity and acceleration of an oscillating object at any
time if you know the amplitude, angular frequency, and phase constant.

This is the same as Equation 13.26, which gives the period of a simple pendulum. Thus, when an object
stretches a vertically hung spring, the period of the system is the same as that of a simple pendulum having a

CHAPTER 13

Oscillatory Motion

13.6 If your goal is simply to stop the bounce from an absorbed shock as rapidly as possible, you should critically
damp the suspension. Unfortunately, the stiffness of this
design makes for an uncomfortable ride. If you underdamp the suspension, the ride is more comfortable but
the car bounces. If you overdamp the suspension, the
wheel is displaced from its equilibrium position longer
than it should be. (For example, after hitting a bump,
the spring stays compressed for a short time and the

wheel does not quickly drop back down into contact
with the road after the wheel is past the bump — a dangerous situation.) Because of all these considerations,
automotive engineers usually design suspensions to be
slightly underdamped. This allows the suspension to absorb a shock rapidly (minimizing the roughness of the
ride) and then return to equilibrium after only one or
two noticeable oscillations.

More than 300 years ago, Isaac Newton
realized that the same gravitational force
that causes apples to fall to the Earth
also holds the Moon in its orbit. In recent
years, scientists have used the Hubble
Space Telescope to collect evidence of
the gravitational force acting even farther away, such as at this protoplanetary
disk in the constellation Taurus. What
properties of an object such as a protoplanet or the Moon determine the
strength of its gravitational attraction to
another object? (Left, Larry West/FPG

The Law of Gravity

B

efore 1687, a large amount of data had been collected on the motions of the
Moon and the planets, but a clear understanding of the forces causing these
motions was not available. In that year, Isaac Newton provided the key that
unlocked the secrets of the heavens. He knew, from his ﬁrst law, that a net force
had to be acting on the Moon because without such a force the Moon would move
in a straight-line path rather than in its almost circular orbit. Newton reasoned
that this force was the gravitational attraction exerted by the Earth on the Moon.
He realized that the forces involved in the Earth – Moon attraction and in the
Sun – planet attraction were not something special to those systems, but rather
were particular cases of a general and universal attraction between objects. In
other words, Newton saw that the same force of attraction that causes the Moon to
follow its path around the Earth also causes an apple to fall from a tree. As he put
it, “I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve;
and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the
force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.”
In this chapter we study the law of gravity. We place emphasis on describing
the motion of the planets because astronomical data provide an important test of
the validity of the law of gravity. We show that the laws of planetary motion developed by Johannes Kepler follow from the law of gravity and the concept of conservation of angular momentum. We then derive a general expression for gravitational potential energy and examine the energetics of planetary and satellite
motion. We close by showing how the law of gravity is also used to determine the
force between a particle and an extended object.

14.1

NEWTON’S LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION

You may have heard the legend that Newton was struck on the head by a falling apple while napping under a tree. This alleged accident supposedly prompted him
to imagine that perhaps all bodies in the Universe were attracted to each other in
the same way the apple was attracted to the Earth. Newton analyzed astronomical
data on the motion of the Moon around the Earth. From that analysis, he made
the bold assertion that the force law governing the motion of planets was the same
as the force law that attracted a falling apple to the Earth. This was the ﬁrst time
that “earthly” and “heavenly” motions were uniﬁed. We shall look at the mathematical details of Newton’s analysis in Section 14.5.
In 1687 Newton published his work on the law of gravity in his treatise Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Newton’s law of universal gravitation
states that
every particle in the Universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to
the square of the distance between them.
If the particles have masses m1 and m 2 and are separated by a distance r, the magnitude of this gravitational force is

14.1 Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

where G is a constant, called the universal gravitational constant, that has been measured experimentally. As noted in Example 6.6, its value in SI units is
G ⫽ 6.673 ⫻ 10 ⫺11 N⭈m2/kg 2

(14.2)

The form of the force law given by Equation 14.1 is often referred to as an inverse-square law because the magnitude of the force varies as the inverse square
of the separation of the particles.1 We shall see other examples of this type of force
law in subsequent chapters. We can express this force in vector form by deﬁning a
unit vector r̂12 (Fig. 14.1). Because this unit vector is directed from particle 1 to
particle 2, the force exerted by particle 1 on particle 2 is
F12 ⫽ ⫺G

m 1m 2
r̂12

(14.3)

where the minus sign indicates that particle 2 is attracted to particle 1, and hence
the force must be directed toward particle 1. By Newton’s third law, the force exerted by particle 2 on particle 1, designated F21 , is equal in magnitude to F12 and
in the opposite direction. That is, these forces form an action – reaction pair, and
F21 ⫽ ⫺F12.
Several features of Equation 14.3 deserve mention. The gravitational force is a
ﬁeld force that always exists between two particles, regardless of the medium that
separates them. Because the force varies as the inverse square of the distance between the particles, it decreases rapidly with increasing separation. We can relate
this fact to the geometry of the situation by noting that the intensity of light emanating from a point source drops off in the same 1/r 2 manner, as shown in Figure
14.2.
Another important point about Equation 14.3 is that the gravitational force
exerted by a ﬁnite-size, spherically symmetric mass distribution on a particle outside the distribution is the same as if the entire mass of the distribution were concentrated at the center. For example, the force exerted by the

Figure 14.2 Light radiating from a
point source drops off as 1/r 2, a relationship that matches the way the gravitational force depends on distance. When
the distance from the light source is doubled, the light has to cover four times the
area and thus is one fourth as bright.

Fg ⫽ G

ME m
R E2

(14.4)

where ME is the Earth’s mass and RE its radius. This force is directed toward the
center of the Earth.
We have evidence of the fact that the gravitational force acting on an object is
directly proportional to its mass from our observations of falling objects, discussed
in Chapter 2. All objects, regardless of mass, fall in the absence of air resistance at
the same acceleration g near the surface of the Earth. According to Newton’s second law, this acceleration is given by g ⫽ F g /m, where m is the mass of the falling
object. If this ratio is to be the same for all falling objects, then Fg must be directly
proportional to m, so that the mass cancels in the ratio. If we consider the more
general situation of a gravitational force between any two objects with mass, such
as two planets, this same argument can be applied to show that the gravitational
force is proportional to one of the masses. We can choose either of the masses in
the argument, however; thus, the gravitational force must be directly proportional
to both masses, as can be seen in Equation 14.3.

14.2

MEASURING THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT

The universal gravitational constant G was measured in an important experiment
by Henry Cavendish (1731 – 1810) in 1798. The Cavendish apparatus consists of
two small spheres, each of mass m, ﬁxed to the ends of a light horizontal rod suspended by a ﬁne ﬁber or thin metal wire, as illustrated in Figure 14.3. When two
large spheres, each of mass M, are placed near the smaller ones, the attractive
force between smaller and larger spheres causes the rod to rotate and twist the
wire suspension to a new equilibrium orientation. The angle of rotation is measured by the deﬂection of a light beam reﬂected from a mirror attached to the vertical suspension. The deﬂection of the light is an effective technique for amplifying the motion. The experiment is carefully repeated with different masses at
various separations. In addition to providing a value for G, the results show experimentally that the force is attractive, proportional to the product mM, and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance r.

Three 0.300-kg billiard balls are placed on a table at the corners of a right triangle, as shown in Figure 14.4. Calculate the
gravitational force on the cue ball (designated m 1 ) resulting
from the other two balls.

Solution First we calculate separately the individual forces
on the cue ball due to the other two balls, and then we ﬁnd
the vector sum to get the resultant force. We can see graphically that this force should point upward and toward the

FREE-FALL ACCELERATION AND THE
GRAVITATIONAL FORCE

In Chapter 5, when deﬁning mg as the weight of an object of mass m, we referred
to g as the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration. Now we are in a position to obtain a more fundamental description of g. Because the force acting on a freely
falling object of mass m near the Earth’s surface is given by Equation 14.4, we can
equate mg to this force to obtain
mg ⫽ G

Because this value is about twice the density of most rocks at
the Earth’s surface, we conclude that the inner core of the
Earth has a density much higher than the average value. It is
most amazing that the Cavendish experiment, which determines G (and can be done on a tabletop), combined with
simple free-fall measurements of g, provides information
about the core of the Earth.

KEPLER’S LAWS

People have observed the movements of the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies for thousands of years. In early history, scientists regarded the Earth as the center of the Universe. This so-called geocentric model was elaborated and formalized
by the Greek astronomer Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – c. 170) in the second century
A.D. and was accepted for the next 1 400 years. In 1543 the Polish astronomer
Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543) suggested that the Earth and the other planets
revolved in circular orbits around the Sun (the heliocentric model).
The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546 – 1601) wanted to determine how
the heavens were constructed, and thus he developed a program to determine the
positions of both stars and planets. It is interesting to note that those observations
of the planets and 777 stars visible to the naked eye were carried out with only a
large sextant and a compass. (The telescope had not yet been invented.)
The German astronomer Johannes Kepler was Brahe’s assistant for a short
while before Brahe’s death, whereupon he acquired his mentor’s astronomical
data and spent 16 years trying to deduce a mathematical model for the motion of
the planets. Such data are difﬁcult to sort out because the Earth is also in motion
around the Sun. After many laborious calculations, Kepler found that Brahe’s data
on the revolution of Mars around the Sun provided the answer.

CHAPTER 14

The Law of Gravity

Kepler’s analysis ﬁrst showed that the concept of circular orbits around the
Sun had to be abandoned. He eventually discovered that the orbit of Mars could
be accurately described by an ellipse. Figure 14.5 shows the geometric description
of an ellipse. The longest dimension is called the major axis and is of length 2a,
where a is the semimajor axis. The shortest dimension is the minor axis, of
length 2b, where b is the semiminor axis. On either side of the center is a focal
point, a distance c from the center, where a 2 ⫽ b 2 ⫹ c 2. The Sun is located at one
of the focal points of Mars’s orbit. Kepler generalized his analysis to include the
motions of all planets. The complete analysis is summarized in three statements
known as Kepler’s laws:
Kepler’s laws

1. All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focal point.
2. The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in
equal time intervals.
3. The square of the orbital period of any planet is proportional to the cube of
the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit.

The semimajor axis has a length a,
and the semiminor axis has a
length b. The focal points are located at a distance c from the center, where a 2 ⫽ b 2 ⫹ c 2.

Most of the planetary orbits are close to circular in shape; for example, the
semimajor and semiminor axes of the orbit of Mars differ by only 0.4%. Mercury
and Pluto have the most elliptical orbits of the nine planets. In addition to the
planets, there are many asteroids and comets orbiting the Sun that obey Kepler’s
laws. Comet Halley is such an object; it becomes visible when it is close to the Sun
every 76 years. Its orbit is very elliptical, with a semiminor axis 76% smaller than its
semimajor axis.
Although we do not prove it here, Kepler’s ﬁrst law is a direct consequence of
the fact that the gravitational force varies as 1/r 2. That is, under an inverse-square
gravitational-force law, the orbit of a planet can be shown mathematically to be an
ellipse with the Sun at one focal point. Indeed, half a century after Kepler developed his laws, Newton demonstrated that these laws are a consequence of the gravitational force that exists between any two masses. Newton’s law of universal gravitation, together with his development of the laws of motion, provides the basis for
a full mathematical solution to the motion of planets and satellites.

14.5

THE LAW OF GRAVITY AND
THE MOTION OF PLANETS

In formulating his law of gravity, Newton used the following reasoning, which supports the assumption that the gravitational force is proportional to the inverse
square of the separation between the two interacting bodies. He compared the acceleration of the Moon in its orbit with the acceleration of an object falling near
the Earth’s surface, such as the legendary apple (Fig. 14.6). Assuming that both accelerations had the same cause — namely, the gravitational attraction of the
Earth — Newton used the inverse-square law to reason that the acceleration of the
Moon toward the Earth (centripetal acceleration) should be proportional to
1/rM2, where rM is the distance between the centers of the Earth and the Moon.
Furthermore, the acceleration of the apple toward the Earth should be proportional to 1/R E 2, where R E is the radius of the Earth, or the distance between the
centers of the Earth and the apple. Using the values r M ⫽ 3.84 ⫻ 10 8 m and

In other words, because the Moon is roughly 60 Earth radii away, the gravitational
acceleration at that distance should be about 1/602 of its value at the Earth’s surface. This is just the acceleration needed to account for the circular motion of the
Moon around the Earth. The nearly perfect agreement between this value and the
value Newton obtained using g provides strong evidence of the inverse-square nature of the gravitational force law.
Although these results must have been very encouraging to Newton, he was
deeply troubled by an assumption he made in the analysis. To evaluate the acceleration of an object at the Earth’s surface, Newton treated the Earth as if its mass
were all concentrated at its center. That is, he assumed that the Earth acted as a
particle as far as its inﬂuence on an exterior object was concerned. Several years
later, in 1687, on the basis of his pioneering work in the development of calculus,
Newton proved that this assumption was valid and was a natural consequence of
the law of universal gravitation.

It is informative to show that Kepler’s third law can be predicted from the inversesquare law for circular orbits.2 Consider a planet of mass Mp moving around the
Sun of mass MS in a circular orbit, as shown in Figure 14.7. Because the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the planet is a radially directed force that keeps
the planet moving in a circle, we can apply Newton’s second law (⌺F ⫽ ma) to the
planet:

Because the orbital speed v of the planet is simply 2␲r/T, where T is its period of

Equation 14.7 is Kepler’s third law. It can be shown that the law is also valid
for elliptical orbits if we replace r with the length of the semimajor axis a. Note
that the constant of proportionality K S is independent of the mass of the planet.
Therefore, Equation 14.7 is valid for any planet.3 Table 14.2 contains a collection
of useful planetary data. The last column veriﬁes that T 2/r 3 is a constant. The
small variations in the values in this column reﬂect uncertainties in the measured
values of the periods and semimajor axes of the planets.
If we were to consider the orbit around the Earth of a satellite such as the
Moon, then the proportionality constant would have a different value, with the
Sun’s mass replaced by the Earth’s mass.

In Example 14.3, an understanding of gravitational forces enabled us to ﬁnd out something about the density of the
Earth’s core, and now we have used this understanding to determine the mass of the Sun.

The orbits of all planets except Mercury and Pluto are very close to being circular; hence, we do not
introduce much error with this assumption. For example, the ratio of the semiminor axis to the semimajor axis for the Earth’s orbit is b/a ⫽ 0.999 86.

Equation 14.7 is indeed a proportion because the ratio of the two quantities T 2 and r 3 is a constant.
The variables in a proportion are not required to be limited to the ﬁrst power only.

Kepler’s Second Law and Conservation of Angular Momentum
Consider a planet of mass Mp moving around the Sun in an elliptical orbit (Fig.
14.8). The gravitational force acting on the planet is always along the radius vector,
directed toward the Sun, as shown in Figure 14.9a. When a force is directed toward or away from a ﬁxed point and is a function of r only, it is called a central
force. The torque acting on the planet due to this force is clearly zero; that is, because F is parallel to r,

␶ ⫽ r ⴛ F ⫽ r ⴛ F r̂ ⫽ 0
(You may want to revisit Section 11.2 to refresh your memory on the vector product.) Recall from Equation 11.19, however, that torque equals the time rate of
change of angular momentum: ␶ ⫽ d L/dt. Therefore, because the gravitational

When the time interval required

vector are equal. Note that in order
for this to be true, the planet must
be moving faster between C and D
than between A and B.

The Law of Gravity

Because L remains constant, the planet’s motion at any instant is restricted to the
plane formed by r and v.
We can relate this result to the following geometric consideration. The radius
vector r in Figure 14.9b sweeps out an area dA in a time dt. This area equals onehalf the area 兩 r ⴛ d r 兩 of the parallelogram formed by the vectors r and dr (see
Section 11.2). Because the displacement of the planet in a time dt is dr ⫽ vdt, we
can say that

where L and Mp are both constants. Thus, we conclude that
the radius vector from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time
intervals.
It is important to recognize that this result, which is Kepler’s second law, is a consequence of the fact that the force of gravity is a central force, which in turn implies that angular momentum is constant. Therefore, Kepler’s second law applies
to any situation involving a central force, whether inverse-square or not.

Motion in an Elliptical Orbit

A satellite of mass m moves in an elliptical orbit around the
Earth (Fig. 14.10). The minimum distance of the satellite
from the Earth is called the perigee (indicated by p in Fig.
va

Solution As the satellite moves from perigee toward
apogee, it is moving farther from the Earth. Thus, a component of the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the
satellite is opposite the velocity vector. Negative work is done
on the satellite, which causes it to slow down, according to
the work – kinetic energy theorem. As a result, we expect the
speed at apogee to be lower than the speed at perigee.
The angular momentum of the satellite relative to the
Earth is r ⴛ m v ⫽ m r ⴛ v. At the points a and p, v is perpendicular to r. Therefore, the magnitude of the angular momentum at these positions is L a ⫽ mv ar a and L p ⫽ mv p r p . Because angular momentum is constant, we see that

14.6 The Gravitational Field

Quick Quiz 14.1
How would you explain the fact that Saturn and Jupiter have periods much greater than
one year?

14.6

THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

When Newton published his theory of universal gravitation, it was considered a
success because it satisfactorily explained the motion of the planets. Since 1687
the same theory has been used to account for the motions of comets, the deﬂection of a Cavendish balance, the orbits of binary stars, and the rotation of galaxies.
Nevertheless, both Newton’s contemporaries and his successors found it difﬁcult
to accept the concept of a force that acts through a distance, as mentioned in Section 5.1. They asked how it was possible for two objects to interact when they were
not in contact with each other. Newton himself could not answer that question.
An approach to describing interactions between objects that are not in contact
came well after Newton’s death, and it enables us to look at the gravitational interaction in a different way. As described in Section 5.1, this alternative approach uses
the concept of a gravitational ﬁeld that exists at every point in space. When a
particle of mass m is placed at a point where the gravitational ﬁeld is g, the particle
experiences a force Fg ⫽ mg. In other words, the ﬁeld exerts a force on the particle. Hence, the gravitational ﬁeld g is deﬁned as
g⬅

Fg
m

(14.10)

That is, the gravitational ﬁeld at a point in space equals the gravitational force experienced by a test particle placed at that point divided by the mass of the test particle. Notice that the presence of the test particle is not necessary for the ﬁeld to exist —the Earth creates the gravitational ﬁeld. We call the object creating the ﬁeld
the source particle (although the Earth is clearly not a particle; we shall discuss
shortly the fact that we can approximate the Earth as a particle for the purpose of
ﬁnding the gravitational ﬁeld that it creates). We can detect the presence of the
ﬁeld and measure its strength by placing a test particle in the ﬁeld and noting the
force exerted on it.
Although the gravitational force is inherently an interaction between two objects, the concept of a gravitational ﬁeld allows us to “factor out” the mass of one
of the objects. In essence, we are describing the “effect” that any object (in this
case, the Earth) has on the empty space around itself in terms of the force that
would be present if a second object were somewhere in that space.4
As an example of how the ﬁeld concept works, consider an object of mass m
near the Earth’s surface. Because the gravitational force acting on the object has a
magnitude GME m/r 2 (see Eq. 14.4), the ﬁeld g at a distance r from the center of
the Earth is

We shall return to this idea of mass affecting the space around it when we discuss Einstein’s theory of
gravitation in Chapter 39.

Figure 14.11a. Note that the ﬁeld vectors at different points surrounding the Earth
vary in both direction and magnitude. In a small region near the Earth’s surface,
the downward ﬁeld g is approximately constant and uniform, as indicated in Figure 14.11b. Equation 14.11 is valid at all points outside the Earth’s surface, assuming that the Earth is spherical. At the Earth’s surface, where r ⫽ R E , g has a magnitude of 9.80 N/kg.

14.7

GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY

In Chapter 8 we introduced the concept of gravitational potential energy, which is
the energy associated with the position of a particle. We emphasized that the gravitational potential energy function U ⫽ mgy is valid only when the particle is near
the Earth’s surface, where the gravitational force is constant. Because the gravitational force between two particles varies as 1/r 2, we expect that a more general potential energy function — one that is valid without the restriction of having to be
near the Earth’s surface — will be signiﬁcantly different from U ⫽ mgy.
Before we calculate this general form for the gravitational potential energy
function, let us ﬁrst verify that the gravitational force is conservative. (Recall from Section 8.2 that a force is conservative if the work it does on an object moving between any two points is independent of the path taken by the object.) To do this,
we ﬁrst note that the gravitational force is a central force. By deﬁnition, a central
force is any force that is directed along a radial line to a ﬁxed center and has a
magnitude that depends only on the radial coordinate r. Hence, a central force
can be represented by F(r)r̂, where r̂ is a unit vector directed from the origin to
the particle, as shown in Figure 14.12.
Consider a central force acting on a particle moving along the general path P
to Q in Figure 14.12. The path from P to Q can be approximated by a series of

437

14.7 Gravitational Potential Energy

steps according to the following procedure. In Figure 14.12, we draw several thin
wedges, which are shown as dashed lines. The outer boundary of our set of wedges
is a path consisting of short radial line segments and arcs (gray in the ﬁgure). We
select the length of the radial dimension of each wedge such that the short arc at
the wedge’s wide end intersects the actual path of the particle. Then we can approximate the actual path with a series of zigzag movements that alternate between moving along an arc and moving along a radial line.
By deﬁnition, a central force is always directed along one of the radial segments; therefore, the work done by F along any radial segment is
dW ⫽ F ⴢ dr ⫽ F(r) dr
You should recall that, by deﬁnition, the work done by a force that is perpendicular to the displacement is zero. Hence, the work done in moving along any arc is
zero because F is perpendicular to the displacement along these segments. Therefore, the total work done by F is the sum of the contributions along the radial segments:
W⫽

冕

rf

F(r) dr

Work done by a central force

ri

where the subscripts i and f refer to the initial and ﬁnal positions. Because the integrand is a function only of the radial position, this integral depends only on the
initial and ﬁnal values of r. Thus, the work done is the same over any path from P
to Q. Because the work done is independent of the path and depends only on the
end points, we conclude that any central force is conservative. We are now assured
that a potential energy function can be obtained once the form of the central
force is speciﬁed.
Recall from Equation 8.2 that the change in the gravitational potential energy
associated with a given displacement is deﬁned as the negative of the work done by
the gravitational force during that displacement:

This expression shows that the gravitational potential energy for any pair of particles varies as 1/r, whereas the force between them varies as 1/r 2. Furthermore, the
potential energy is negative because the force is attractive and we have taken the
potential energy as zero when the particle separation is inﬁnite. Because the force
between the particles is attractive, we know that an external agent must do positive
work to increase the separation between them. The work done by the external
agent produces an increase in the potential energy as the two particles are separated. That is, U becomes less negative as r increases.
When two particles are at rest and separated by a distance r, an external agent
has to supply an energy at least equal to ⫹ Gm1 m 2 /r in order to separate the particles to an inﬁnite distance. It is therefore convenient to think of the absolute value
of the potential energy as the binding energy of the system. If the external agent
supplies an energy greater than the binding energy, the excess energy of the system will be in the form of kinetic energy when the particles are at an inﬁnite separation.
We can extend this concept to three or more particles. In this case, the total
potential energy of the system is the sum over all pairs of particles.5 Each pair contributes a term of the form given by Equation 14.15. For example, if the system
contains three particles, as in Figure 14.15, we ﬁnd that

1

(14.14)

This expression applies to the Earth – particle system where the two masses are separated by a distance r, provided that r ⱖ R E . The result is not valid for particles inside the Earth, where r ⬍ R E . (The situation in which r ⬍ R E is treated in Section
14.10.) Because of our choice of Ui , the function U is always negative (Fig. 14.14).
Although Equation 14.14 was derived for the particle – Earth system, it can be
applied to any two particles. That is, the gravitational potential energy associated
with any pair of particles of masses m1 and m 2 separated by a distance r is

If we assume that the body of mass M is at rest in an inertial reference frame, then

This equation shows that E may be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the
value of v. However, for a bound system,7 such as the Earth – Sun system, E is necessarily less than zero because we have chosen the convention that U : 0 as r : ⬁.
We can easily establish that E ⬍ 0 for the system consisting of a body of mass m
moving in a circular orbit about a body of mass M W m (Fig. 14.16). Newton’s second law applied to the body of mass m gives

You might recognize that we have ignored the acceleration and kinetic energy of the larger body. To
see that this simpliﬁcation is reasonable, consider an object of mass m falling toward the Earth. Because
the center of mass of the object – Earth system is effectively stationary, it follows that mv ⫽ M E v E . Thus,
the Earth acquires a kinetic energy equal to

Of the three examples provided at the beginning of this section, the planet moving around the Sun
and a satellite in orbit around the Earth are bound systems — the Earth will always stay near the Sun,
and the satellite will always stay near the Earth. The one-time comet ﬂyby represents an unbound
system — the comet interacts once with the Sun but is not bound to it. Thus, in theory the comet can
move inﬁnitely far away from the Sun.

This result clearly shows that the total mechanical energy is negative in the
case of circular orbits. Note that the kinetic energy is positive and equal to
one-half the absolute value of the potential energy. The absolute value of E is
also equal to the binding energy of the system, because this amount of energy
must be provided to the system to move the two masses inﬁnitely far apart.
The total mechanical energy is also negative in the case of elliptical orbits. The
expression for E for elliptical orbits is the same as Equation 14.19 with r replaced
by the semimajor axis length a. Furthermore, the total energy is constant if we assume that the system is isolated. Therefore, as the body of mass m moves from P to
Q in Figure 14.13, the total energy remains constant and Equation 14.17 gives

constants of the motion.

EXAMPLE 14.7

Changing the Orbit of a Satellite

The space shuttle releases a 470-kg communications satellite
while in an orbit that is 280 km above the surface of the
Earth. A rocket engine on the satellite boosts it into a geosynchronous orbit, which is an orbit in which the satellite stays
directly over a single location on the Earth. How much energy did the engine have to provide?

Solution First we must determine the radius of a geosynchronous orbit. Then we can calculate the change in energy
needed to boost the satellite into orbit.
The period of the orbit T must be one day (86 400 s), so
that the satellite travels once around the Earth in the same
time that the Earth spins once on its axis. Knowing the period, we can then apply Kepler’s third law (Eq. 14.7) to ﬁnd
the radius, once we replace K S with K E ⫽ 4␲ 2/GM E ⫽

14.8 Energy Considerations in Planetary and Satellite Motion
This is the energy equivalent of 89 gal of gasoline. NASA engineers must account for the changing mass of the spacecraft
as it ejects burned fuel, something we have not done here.
Would you expect the calculation that includes the effect of
this changing mass to yield a greater or lesser amount of energy required from the engine?
If we wish to determine how the energy is distributed
after the engine is ﬁred, we ﬁnd from Equation 14.18
that
the
change
in
kinetic
energy
is
⌬K ⫽
(GM E m/2)(1/R f ⫺ 1/R i ) ⫽ ⫺1.19 ⫻ 10 10 J (a decrease),

and the corresponding change in potential energy is
⌬U ⫽ ⫺GM E m(1/R f ⫺ 1/R i ) ⫽ 2.38 ⫻ 10 10 J (an increase).
Thus, the change in mechanical energy of the system is
⌬E ⫽ ⌬K ⫹ ⌬U ⫽ 1.19 ⫻ 10 10 J, as we already calculated.
The ﬁring of the engine results in an increase in the total mechanical energy of the system. Because an increase in potential energy is accompanied by a decrease in kinetic energy, we
conclude that the speed of an orbiting satellite decreases as
its altitude increases.

Escape Speed
vf = 0

Suppose an object of mass m is projected vertically upward from the Earth’s surface with an initial speed vi , as illustrated in Figure 14.17. We can use energy considerations to ﬁnd the minimum value of the initial speed needed to allow the object to escape the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Equation 14.17 gives the total energy
of the object at any point. At the surface of the Earth, v ⫽ v i and r ⫽ r i ⫽ R E .
When the object reaches its maximum altitude, v ⫽ v f ⫽ 0 and r ⫽ r f ⫽ r max . Because the total energy of the system is constant, substituting these conditions into
Equation 14.20 gives

Therefore, if the initial speed is known, this expression can be used to calculate
the maximum altitude h because we know that
h ⫽ r max ⫺ R E
We are now in a position to calculate escape speed, which is the minimum
speed the object must have at the Earth’s surface in order to escape from the inﬂuence of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Traveling at this minimum speed, the object
continues to move farther and farther away from the Earth as its speed asymptotically approaches zero. Letting r max : ⬁ in Equation 14.21 and taking v i ⫽ v esc , we
obtain

Note that this expression for vesc is independent of the mass of the object. In
other words, a spacecraft has the same escape speed as a molecule. Furthermore, the result is independent of the direction of the velocity and ignores air
resistance.
If the object is given an initial speed equal to vesc , its total energy is equal to
zero. This can be seen by noting that when r : ⬁, the object’s kinetic energy and
its potential energy are both zero. If vi is greater than vesc , the total energy is
greater than zero and the object has some residual kinetic energy as r : ⬁.

Sun. These results, together with some ideas from the kinetic theory of gases (see
Chapter 21), explain why some planets have atmospheres and others do not. As we
shall see later, a gas molecule has an average kinetic energy that depends on the
temperature of the gas. Hence, lighter molecules, such as hydrogen and helium,
have a higher average speed than heavier species at the same temperature. When
the average speed of the lighter molecules is not much less than the escape speed
of a planet, a signiﬁcant fraction of them have a chance to escape from the planet.
This mechanism also explains why the Earth does not retain hydrogen molecules and helium atoms in its atmosphere but does retain heavier molecules, such
as oxygen and nitrogen. On the other hand, the very large escape speed for
Jupiter enables that planet to retain hydrogen, the primary constituent of its atmosphere.

THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN AN
EXTENDED OBJECT AND A PARTICLE

We have emphasized that the law of universal gravitation given by Equation 14.3 is
valid only if the interacting objects are treated as particles. In view of this, how can
we calculate the force between a particle and an object having ﬁnite dimensions?
This is accomplished by treating the extended object as a collection of particles
and making use of integral calculus. We ﬁrst evaluate the potential energy function, and then calculate the gravitational force from that function.
We obtain the potential energy associated with a system consisting of a particle
of mass m and an extended object of mass M by dividing the object into many elements, each having a mass ⌬Mi (Fig. 14.19). The potential energy associated with
the system consisting of any one element and the particle is U ⫽ ⫺Gm ⌬M i /r i ,
where ri is the distance from the particle to the element ⌬Mi . The total potential
energy of the overall system is obtained by taking the sum over all elements as
⌬Mi : 0. In this limit, we can express U in integral form as
U ⫽ ⫺Gm

冕

dM
r

(14.23)

Once U has been evaluated, we obtain the force exerted by the extended object
on the particle by taking the negative derivative of this scalar function (see Section
8.6). If the extended object has spherical symmetry, the function U depends only
on r, and the force is given by ⫺ dU/dr. We treat this situation in Section 14.10. In
principle, one can evaluate U for any geometry; however, the integration can be
cumbersome.
An alternative approach to evaluating the gravitational force between a particle and an extended object is to perform a vector sum over all mass elements of
the object. Using the procedure outlined in evaluating U and the law of universal
gravitation in the form shown in Equation 14.3, we obtain, for the total force exerted on the particle

where r̂ is a unit vector directed from the element dM toward the particle (see Fig.

of r̂. This procedure is not always recommended because working with a vector
function is more difﬁcult than working with the scalar potential energy function.
However, if the geometry is simple, as in the following example, the evaluation of
F can be straightforward.

Gravitational Force Between a Particle and a Bar

The left end of a homogeneous bar of length L and mass M
is at a distance h from a particle of mass m (Fig. 14.20). Calculate the total gravitational force exerted by the bar on the
particle.

Solution

The arbitrary segment of the bar of length dx
has a mass dM. Because the mass per unit length is constant,
it follows that the ratio of masses dM/M is equal to the ratio

of lengths dx/L, and so dM ⫽ (M/L) dx. In this problem, the
variable r in Equation 14.24 is the distance x shown in Figure
14.20, the unit vector r̂ is r̂ ⫽ ⫺i, and the force acting on the
particle is to the right; therefore, Equation 14.24 gives us

We see that the force exerted on the particle is in the positive
x direction, which is what we expect because the gravitational
force is attractive.
Note that in the limit L : 0, the force varies as 1/h 2,
which is what we expect for the force between two point
masses. Furthermore, if h W L, the force also varies as 1/h 2.
This can be seen by noting that the denominator of the expression for Fg can be expressed in the form h 2(1 ⫹ L/h),
which is approximately equal to h2 when h W L . Thus, when
bodies are separated by distances that are great relative to
their characteristic dimensions, they behave like particles.

THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN A
PARTICLE AND A SPHERICAL MASS

We have already stated that a large sphere attracts a particle outside it as if the total mass of the sphere were concentrated at its center. We now describe the force
acting on a particle when the extended object is either a spherical shell or a solid
sphere, and then apply these facts to some interesting systems.

Spherical Shell
Case 1. If a particle of mass m is located outside a spherical shell of mass M at,
for instance, point P in Figure 14.21a, the shell attracts the particle as though the
mass of the shell were concentrated at its center. We can show this, as Newton did,
with integral calculus. Thus, as far as the gravitational force acting on a particle
outside the shell is concerned, a spherical shell acts no differently from the solid
spherical distributions of mass we have seen.
Case 2. If the particle is located inside the shell (at point P in Fig. 14.21b), the
gravitational force acting on it can be shown to be zero.
We can express these two important results in the following way:

mass m located at point P outside a spherical shell of mass M cancel out. (b) The spherical shell
can be broken into rings. Even though point P is closer to the top ring than to the bottom ring,
the bottom ring is larger, and the gravitational forces exerted on the particle at P by the matter
in the two rings cancel each other. Thus, for a particle located at any point P inside the shell,
there is no gravitational force exerted on the particle by the mass M of the shell. (c) The magnitude of the gravitational force versus the radial distance r from the center of the shell.

The shell does not act as a gravitational shield, which means that a particle inside a shell may experience forces exerted by bodies outside the shell.

Solid Sphere
Case 1. If a particle of mass m is located outside a homogeneous solid sphere of
mass M (at point P in Fig. 14.22), the sphere attracts the particle as though the

mass of the sphere were concentrated at its center. We have used this notion at several places in this chapter already, and we can argue it from Equation 14.25a. A
solid sphere can be considered to be a collection of concentric spherical shells.
The masses of all of the shells can be interpreted as being concentrated at their
common center, and the gravitational force is equivalent to that due to a particle
of mass M located at that center.
Case 2. If a particle of mass m is located inside a homogeneous solid sphere of
mass M (at point Q in Fig. 14.22), the gravitational force acting on it is due only to
the mass M⬘ contained within the sphere of radius r ⬍ R, shown in Figure 14.22.

The gravitational force acting on a particle when it is outside a uniform solid

on the particle when it is inside such a sphere is proportional to r and goes to zero at the center.

447

14.10 The Gravitational Force Between a Particle and a Spherical Mass

farther from the center than Q can be treated as a series of concentric spherical
shells that do not exert a net force on the particle because the particle is inside
them. Because the sphere is assumed to have a uniform density, it follows that the
ratio of masses M⬘/M is equal to the ratio of volumes V ⬘/V, where V is the total volume of the sphere and V ⬘ is the volume within the sphere of radius r only:

This equation tells us that at the center of the solid sphere, where r ⫽ 0, the gravitational force goes to zero, as we intuitively expect. The force as a function of r is
plotted in Figure 14.22.
Case 3. If a particle is located inside a solid sphere having a density ␳ that is
spherically symmetric but not uniform, then M⬘ in Equation 14.26b is given by an
integral of the form M⬘ ⫽ 冕 ␳ dV, where the integration is taken over the volume
contained within the sphere of radius r in Figure 14.22. We can evaluate this integral if the radial variation of ␳ is given. In this case, we take the volume element dV
as the volume of a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr, and thus
dV ⫽ 4␲r 2 dr. For example, if ␳ ⫽ Ar, where A is a constant, it is left to a problem
(Problem 63) to show that M⬘ ⫽ ␲Ar 4.
Hence, we see from Equation 14.26b that F is proportional to r 2 in this case and is
zero at the center.

Summary

In this expression, ME is the mass of the Earth and RE is its radius. Thus, the weight
of an object decreases as the object moves away from the Earth’s surface.
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion state that
1. All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focal point.
2. The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in
equal time intervals.
3. The square of the orbital period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the
semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit.

where MS is the mass of the Sun and r is the orbital radius. For elliptical orbits,
Equation 14.7 is valid if r is replaced by the semimajor axis a. Most planets have
nearly circular orbits around the Sun.
The gravitational ﬁeld at a point in space equals the gravitational force experienced by any test particle located at that point divided by the mass of the test
particle:

by a term of the form given by Equation 14.15.
If an isolated system consists of a particle of mass m moving with a speed v in

The Law of Gravity

QUESTIONS
1. Use Kepler’s second law to convince yourself that the
Earth must move faster in its orbit during December,
when it is closest to the Sun, than during June, when it is
farthest from the Sun.
2. The gravitational force that the Sun exerts on the Moon
is about twice as great as the gravitational force that the
Earth exerts on the Moon. Why doesn’t the Sun pull the
Moon away from the Earth during a total eclipse of the
Sun?
3. If a system consists of ﬁve particles, how many terms appear in the expression for the total potential energy? How
many terms appear if the system consists of N particles?
4. Is it possible to calculate the potential energy function associated with a particle and an extended body without
knowing the geometry or mass distribution of the extended body?
5. Does the escape speed of a rocket depend on its mass?
Explain.
6. Compare the energies required to reach the Moon for a
105-kg spacecraft and a 103-kg satellite.
7. Explain why it takes more fuel for a spacecraft to travel
from the Earth to the Moon than for the return trip. Estimate the difference.
8. Why don’t we put a geosynchronous weather satellite in
orbit around the 45th parallel? Wouldn’t this be more
useful for the United States than such a satellite in orbit
around the equator?
9. Is the potential energy associated with the Earth – Moon
system greater than, less than, or equal to the kinetic energy of the Moon relative to the Earth?
10. Explain why no work is done on a planet as it moves in a
circular orbit around the Sun, even though a gravita-

tional force is acting on the planet. What is the net work
done on a planet during each revolution as it moves
around the Sun in an elliptical orbit?
Explain why the force exerted on a particle by a uniform
sphere must be directed toward the center of the sphere.
Would this be the case if the mass distribution of the
sphere were not spherically symmetric?
Neglecting the density variation of the Earth, what would
be the period of a particle moving in a smooth hole dug
between opposite points on the Earth’s surface, passing
through its center?
At what position in its elliptical orbit is the speed of a
planet a maximum? At what position is the speed a minimum?
If you were given the mass and radius of planet X, how
would you calculate the free-fall acceleration on the surface of this planet?
If a hole could be dug to the center of the Earth, do you
think that the force on a mass m would still obey Equation 14.1 there? What do you think the force on m would
be at the center of the Earth?
In his 1798 experiment, Cavendish was said to have
“weighed the Earth.” Explain this statement.
The gravitational force exerted on the Voyager spacecraft
by Jupiter accelerated it toward escape speed from the
Sun. How is this possible?
How would you ﬁnd the mass of the Moon?
The Apollo 13 spaceship developed trouble in the oxygen
system about halfway to the Moon. Why did the spaceship
continue on around the Moon and then return home,
rather than immediately turn back to Earth?

A cylindrical habitat in space, 6.00 km in diameter and

Such a habitat would have cities, land, and lakes on the

these would be held in place by the rotation of the
cylinder about its long axis. How fast would the cylinder
have to rotate to imitate the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld at

as a point mass located at the center of the sphere.
Newton’s law of universal gravitation is valid for distances covering an enormous range, but it is thought to
fail for very small distances, where the structure of space
itself is uncertain. The crossover distance, far less than
the diameter of an atomic nucleus, is called the Planck
length. It is determined by a combination of the constants G, c, and h, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and h is Planck’s constant (introduced brieﬂy in
Chapter 11 and discussed in greater detail in Chapter
40) with units of angular momentum. (a) Use dimensional analysis to ﬁnd a combination of these three universal constants that has units of length. (b) Determine

14.1 Kepler’s third law (Eq. 14.7), which applies to all the
planets, tells us that the period of a planet is proportional to r 3/2. Because Saturn and Jupiter are farther
from the Sun than the Earth is, they have longer periods. The Sun’s gravitational ﬁeld is much weaker at Saturn and Jupiter than it is at the Earth. Thus, these planets experience much less centripetal acceleration than
the Earth does, and they have correspondingly longer
periods.

atter is normally classiﬁed as being in one of three states: solid, liquid, or
gas. From everyday experience, we know that a solid has a deﬁnite volume
and shape. A brick maintains its familiar shape and size day in and day out.
We also know that a liquid has a deﬁnite volume but no deﬁnite shape. Finally, we
know that an unconﬁned gas has neither a deﬁnite volume nor a deﬁnite shape.
These deﬁnitions help us picture the states of matter, but they are somewhat artiﬁcial. For example, asphalt and plastics are normally considered solids, but over
long periods of time they tend to ﬂow like liquids. Likewise, most substances can
be a solid, a liquid, or a gas (or a combination of any of these), depending on the
temperature and pressure. In general, the time it takes a particular substance to
change its shape in response to an external force determines whether we treat the
substance as a solid, as a liquid, or as a gas.
A ﬂuid is a collection of molecules that are randomly arranged and held together by weak cohesive forces and by forces exerted by the walls of a container.
Both liquids and gases are ﬂuids.
In our treatment of the mechanics of ﬂuids, we shall see that we do not need
to learn any new physical principles to explain such effects as the buoyant force
acting on a submerged object and the dynamic lift acting on an airplane wing.
First, we consider the mechanics of a ﬂuid at rest — that is, ﬂuid statics — and derive
an expression for the pressure exerted by a ﬂuid as a function of its density and
depth. We then treat the mechanics of ﬂuids in motion — that is, ﬂuid dynamics.
We can describe a ﬂuid in motion by using a model in which we make certain simplifying assumptions. We use this model to analyze some situations of practical importance. An analysis leading to Bernoulli’s equation enables us to determine relationships between the pressure, density, and velocity at every point in a ﬂuid.

15.1

PRESSURE

Fluids do not sustain shearing stresses or tensile stresses; thus, the only stress that
can be exerted on an object submerged in a ﬂuid is one that tends to compress
the object. In other words, the force exerted by a ﬂuid on an object is always perpendicular to the surfaces of the object, as shown in Figure 15.1.
The pressure in a ﬂuid can be measured with the device pictured in Figure
15.2. The device consists of an evacuated cylinder that encloses a light piston connected to a spring. As the device is submerged in a ﬂuid, the ﬂuid presses on the
top of the piston and compresses the spring until the inward force exerted by the
ﬂuid is balanced by the outward force exerted by the spring. The ﬂuid pressure
can be measured directly if the spring is calibrated in advance. If F is the magnitude of the force exerted on the piston and A is the surface area of the piston,

Note that pressure is a scalar quantity because it is proportional to the magnitude
of the force on the piston.
To deﬁne the pressure at a speciﬁc point, we consider a ﬂuid acting on the device shown in Figure 15.2. If the force exerted by the ﬂuid over an inﬁnitesimal
surface element of area dA containing the point in question is dF, then the pressure at that point is

As we shall see in the next section, the pressure exerted by a ﬂuid varies with
depth. Therefore, to calculate the total force exerted on a ﬂat wall of a container,
we must integrate Equation 15.2 over the surface area of the wall.
Because pressure is force per unit area, it has units of newtons per square meter (N/m2 ) in the SI system. Another name for the SI unit of pressure is pascal

VARIATION OF PRESSURE WITH DEPTH

As divers well know, water pressure increases with depth. Likewise, atmospheric
pressure decreases with increasing altitude; it is for this reason that aircraft ﬂying
at high altitudes must have pressurized cabins.
We now show how the pressure in a liquid increases linearly with depth. As
Equation 1.1 describes, the density of a substance is deﬁned as its mass per unit volume: ␳ ⬅ m/V. Table 15.1 lists the densities of various substances. These values
vary slightly with temperature because the volume of a substance is temperature
dependent (as we shall see in Chapter 19). Note that under standard conditions
(at 0°C and at atmospheric pressure) the densities of gases are about 1/1 000 the
densities of solids and liquids. This difference implies that the average molecular
spacing in a gas under these conditions is about ten times greater than that in a
solid or liquid.
Now let us consider a ﬂuid of density ␳ at rest and open to the atmosphere, as
shown in Figure 15.4. We assume that ␳ is constant; this means that the ﬂuid is incompressible. Let us select a sample of the liquid contained within an imaginary
cylinder of cross-sectional area A extending from the surface to a depth h. The

pressure exerted by the outside liquid on the bottom face of the cylinder is P, and
the pressure exerted on the top face of the cylinder is the atmospheric pressure P0 .
Therefore, the upward force exerted by the outside ﬂuid on the bottom of the cylinder is PA, and the downward force exerted by the atmosphere on the top is P0 A. The
mass of liquid in the cylinder is M ⫽ ␳V ⫽ ␳Ah; therefore, the weight of the liquid in
the cylinder is Mg ⫽ ␳Ahg. Because the cylinder is in equilibrium, the net force acting on it must be zero. Choosing upward to be the positive y direction, we see that

That is, the pressure P at a depth h below the surface of a liquid open to the
atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount ␳ gh. In our

pressure to be

Equation 15.4 implies that the pressure is the same at all points having the same
depth, independent of the shape of the container.

D

This arrangement of interconnected tubes demonstrates that the
pressure in a liquid is the same at
all points having the same elevation. For example, the pressure is
the same at points A, B, C, and D.

In view of the fact that the pressure in a ﬂuid depends on depth and on the
value of P0 , any increase in pressure at the surface must be transmitted to every
other point in the ﬂuid. This concept was ﬁrst recognized by the French scientist
Blaise Pascal (1623 – 1662) and is called Pascal’s law: A change in the pressure
applied to a ﬂuid is transmitted undiminished to every point of the ﬂuid
and to the walls of the container.
An important application of Pascal’s law is the hydraulic press illustrated in
Figure 15.5a. A force of magnitude F1 is applied to a small piston of surface area
A1 . The pressure is transmitted through a liquid to a larger piston of surface area
A2 . Because the pressure must be the same on both sides, P ⫽ F 1/A1 ⫽ F 2/A2 .
Therefore, the force F2 is greater than the force F1 by a factor A2 /A1 , which is
called the force-multiplying factor. Because liquid is neither added nor removed, the
volume pushed down on the left as the piston moves down a distance d 1 equals the
volume pushed up on the right as the right piston moves up a distance d 2 . That is,
A1d 1 ⫽ A2d 2 ; thus, the force-multiplying factor can also be written as d 1 /d 2 . Note
that F 1d 1 ⫽ F 2d 2 . Hydraulic brakes, car lifts, hydraulic jacks, and forklifts all make
use of this principle (Fig. 15.5b).

force on a small piston that has a circular cross section and a
radius of 5.00 cm. This pressure is transmitted by a liquid to a
piston that has a radius of 15.0 cm. What force must the compressed air exert to lift a car weighing 13 300 N? What air
pressure produces this force?

Solution Because the pressure exerted by the compressed
air is transmitted undiminished throughout the liquid, we have

A Pain in the Ear

Estimate the force exerted on your eardrum due to the water
above when you are swimming at the bottom of a pool that is
5.0 m deep.

Solution

First, we must ﬁnd the unbalanced pressure on

the eardrum; then, after estimating the eardrum’s surface
area, we can determine the force that the water exerts on it.
The air inside the middle ear is normally at atmospheric
pressure P0 . Therefore, to ﬁnd the net force on the eardrum,
we must consider the difference between the total pressure at

We estimate the surface area of the eardrum to be approximately 1 cm2 ⫽ 1 ⫻ 10⫺4 m2. This means that the force on it

EXAMPLE 15.4

is F ⫽ (Pbot ⫺ P0)A ⬇ 5 N. Because a force on the eardrum
of this magnitude is extremely uncomfortable, swimmers often “pop their ears” while under water, an action that pushes
air from the lungs into the middle ear. Using this technique
equalizes the pressure on the two sides of the eardrum and
relieves the discomfort.

The Force on a Dam

Water is ﬁlled to a height H behind a dam of width w (Fig.
15.7). Determine the resultant force exerted by the water on
the dam.

Solution Because pressure varies with depth, we cannot
calculate the force simply by multiplying the area by the pressure. We can solve the problem by ﬁnding the force dF ex-

erted on a narrow horizontal strip at depth h and then integrating the expression to ﬁnd the total force. Let us imagine
a vertical y axis, with y ⫽ 0 at the bottom of the dam and our
strip a distance y above the bottom.
We can use Equation 15.4 to calculate the pressure at the
depth h; we omit atmospheric pressure because it acts on
both sides of the dam:
P ⫽ ␳gh ⫽ ␳g(H ⫺ y)
Using Equation 15.2, we ﬁnd that the force exerted on the
shaded strip of area dA ⫽ w dy is

PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS

One simple device for measuring pressure is the open-tube manometer illustrated
in Figure 15.8a. One end of a U-shaped tube containing a liquid is open to the atmosphere, and the other end is connected to a system of unknown pressure P.
The difference in pressure P ⫺ P0 is equal to ␳gh; hence, P ⫽ P0 ⫹ ␳gh. The pressure P is called the absolute pressure, and the difference P ⫺ P0 is called the
gauge pressure. The latter is the value that normally appears on a pressure
gauge. For example, the pressure you measure in your bicycle tire is the gauge
pressure.
Another instrument used to measure pressure is the common barometer, which
was invented by Evangelista Torricelli (1608 – 1647). The barometer consists of a

BUOYANT FORCES AND ARCHIMEDES’S PRINCIPLE

Have you ever tried to push a beach ball under water? This is extremely difﬁcult to
do because of the large upward force exerted by the water on the ball. The upward
force exerted by water on any immersed object is called a buoyant force. We can
determine the magnitude of a buoyant force by applying some logic and Newton’s
second law. Imagine that, instead of air, the beach ball is ﬁlled with water. If you
were standing on land, it would be difﬁcult to hold the water-ﬁlled ball in your
arms. If you held the ball while standing neck deep in a pool, however, the force
you would need to hold it would almost disappear. In fact, the required force
would be zero if we were to ignore the thin layer of plastic of which the beach ball
is made. Because the water-ﬁlled ball is in equilibrium while it is submerged, the
magnitude of the upward buoyant force must equal its weight.
If the submerged ball were ﬁlled with air rather than water, then the upward
buoyant force exerted by the surrounding water would still be present. However,
because the weight of the water is now replaced by the much smaller weight of that
volume of air, the net force is upward and quite great; as a result, the ball is
pushed to the surface.

CHAPTER 15

Archimedes’s principle

Fluid Mechanics

The manner in which buoyant forces act is summarized by Archimedes’s
principle, which states that the magnitude of the buoyant force always equals
the weight of the ﬂuid displaced by the object. The buoyant force acts vertically upward through the point that was the center of gravity of the displaced ﬂuid.
Note that Archimedes’s principle does not refer to the makeup of the object
experiencing the buoyant force. The object’s composition is not a factor in the
buoyant force. We can verify this in the following manner: Suppose we focus our
attention on the indicated cube of liquid in the container illustrated in Figure
15.9. This cube is in equilibrium as it is acted on by two forces. One of these forces
is the gravitational force Fg . What cancels this downward force? Apparently, the
rest of the liquid in the container is holding the cube in equilibrium. Thus, the
magnitude of the buoyant force B exerted on the cube is exactly equal to the magnitude of Fg , which is the weight of the liquid inside the cube:
B ⫽ Fg

Archimedes

(c. 287 – 212 B.C.)
Archimedes, a Greek mathematician,
physicist, and engineer, was perhaps
the greatest scientist of antiquity. He
was the ﬁrst to compute accurately
the ratio of a circle’s circumference
to its diameter, and he showed how to
calculate the volume and surface
area of spheres, cylinders, and other
geometric shapes. He is well known
for discovering the nature of the
buoyant force.
Archimedes was also a gifted inventor. One of his practical inventions, still in use today, is
Archimedes’s screw – an inclined, rotating, coiled tube originally used to
lift water from the holds of ships. He
also invented the catapult and devised systems of levers, pulleys, and
weights for raising heavy loads. Such
inventions were successfully used to
defend his native city Syracuse during a two-year siege by the Romans.

B

Figure 15.9 The external forces
acting on the cube of liquid are the
force of gravity Fg and the buoyant
force B. Under equilibrium conditions, B ⫽ F g .

Now imagine that the cube of liquid is replaced by a cube of steel of the same
dimensions. What is the buoyant force acting on the steel? The liquid surrounding
a cube behaves in the same way no matter what the cube is made of. Therefore,
the buoyant force acting on the steel cube is the same as the buoyant force
acting on a cube of liquid of the same dimensions. In other words, the magnitude of the buoyant force is the same as the weight of the liquid cube, not the steel
cube. Although mathematically more complicated, this same principle applies to
submerged objects of any shape, size, or density.
Although we have described the magnitude and direction of the buoyant
force, we still do not know its origin. Why would a ﬂuid exert such a strange force,
almost as if the ﬂuid were trying to expel a foreign body? To understand why, look
again at Figure 15.9. The pressure at the bottom of the cube is greater than the
pressure at the top by an amount ␳gh, where h is the length of any side of the cube.
The pressure difference ⌬P between the bottom and top faces of the cube is equal
to the buoyant force per unit area of those faces — that is, ⌬P ⫽ B/A. Therefore,
B ⫽ (⌬P)A ⫽ (␳gh)A ⫽ ␳gV, where V is the volume of the cube. Because the mass
of the ﬂuid in the cube is M ⫽ ␳V, we see that
B ⫽ F g ⫽ ␳Vg ⫽ Mg

(15.5)

where Mg is the weight of the ﬂuid in the cube. Thus, the buoyant force is a result
of the pressure differential on a submerged or partly submerged object.
Before we proceed with a few examples, it is instructive for us to compare the
forces acting on a totally submerged object with those acting on a ﬂoating (partly
submerged) object.
Case 1: Totally Submerged Object When an object is totally submerged in a
ﬂuid of density ␳f , the magnitude of the upward buoyant force is B ⫽ ␳ fVo g, where
Vo is the volume of the object. If the object has a mass M and density ␳o , its weight
is equal to F g ⫽ Mg ⫽ ␳ oVo g, and the net force on it is B ⫺ F g ⫽ (␳ f ⫺ ␳ o)Vo g.
Hence, if the density of the object is less than the density of the ﬂuid, then the
downward force of gravity is less than the buoyant force, and the unconstrained
object accelerates upward (Fig. 15.10a). If the density of the object is greater than
the density of the ﬂuid, then the upward buoyant force is less than the downward
force of gravity, and the unsupported object sinks (Fig. 15.10b).
Case 2: Floating Object Now consider an object of volume Vo in static equilibrium ﬂoating on a ﬂuid — that is, an object that is only partially submerged. In this

case, the upward buoyant force is balanced by the downward gravitational force
acting on the object. If Vf is the volume of the ﬂuid displaced by the object (this
volume is the same as the volume of that part of the object that is beneath the
ﬂuid level), the buoyant force has a magnitude B ⫽ ␳ fVf g. Because the weight of
the object is F g ⫽ Mg ⫽ ␳ oVo g, and because F g ⫽ B, we see that ␳ fVf g ⫽ ␳ oVo g, or

Under normal conditions, the average density of a ﬁsh is slightly greater than
the density of water. It follows that the ﬁsh would sink if it did not have some
mechanism for adjusting its density. The ﬁsh accomplishes this by internally regulating the size of its air-ﬁlled swim bladder to balance the change in the magnitude
of the buoyant force acting on it. In this manner, ﬁsh are able to swim to various
depths. Unlike a ﬁsh, a scuba diver cannot achieve neutral buoyancy (at which the
buoyant force just balances the weight) by adjusting the magnitude of the buoyant
force B. Instead, the diver adjusts Fg by manipulating lead weights.

Archimedes supposedly was asked to determine whether a
crown made for the king consisted of pure gold. Legend has

air and then in water, as shown in Figure 15.12. Suppose the

scale read 7.84 N in air and 6.86 N in water. What should
Archimedes have told the king?

Solution

When the crown is suspended in air, the scale

468

reads the true weight T1 ⫽ F g (neglecting the buoyancy of
air). When it is immersed in water, the buoyant force B
reduces the scale reading to an apparent weight of
T2 ⫽ F g ⫺ B. Hence, the buoyant force exerted on the crown
is the difference between its weight in air and its weight in
water:

he had been cheated. Either the crown was hollow, or it was
not made of pure gold.

weight of the displaced water, we have ␳ w gVw ⫽ 0.98 N, where
Vw is the volume of the displaced water and ␳ w is its density.
Also, the volume of the crown Vc is equal to the volume of the

FLUID DYNAMICS

Thus far, our study of ﬂuids has been restricted to ﬂuids at rest. We now turn our
attention to ﬂuids in motion. Instead of trying to study the motion of each particle
of the ﬂuid as a function of time, we describe the properties of a moving ﬂuid at
each point as a function of time.

Flow Characteristics
When ﬂuid is in motion, its ﬂow can be characterized as being one of two main
types. The ﬂow is said to be steady, or laminar, if each particle of the ﬂuid follows
a smooth path, such that the paths of different particles never cross each other, as
shown in Figure 15.14. In steady ﬂow, the velocity of the ﬂuid at any point remains
constant in time.
Above a certain critical speed, ﬂuid ﬂow becomes turbulent; turbulent ﬂow is irregular ﬂow characterized by small whirlpool-like regions, as shown in Figure 15.15.
The term viscosity is commonly used in the description of ﬂuid ﬂow to characterize the degree of internal friction in the ﬂuid. This internal friction, or viscous
force, is associated with the resistance that two adjacent layers of ﬂuid have to moving relative to each other. Viscosity causes part of the kinetic energy of a ﬂuid to be
converted to internal energy. This mechanism is similar to the one by which an object sliding on a rough horizontal surface loses kinetic energy.
Because the motion of real ﬂuids is very complex and not fully understood, we
make some simplifying assumptions in our approach. In our model of an ideal
ﬂuid, we make the following four assumptions:
1. The ﬂuid is nonviscous. In a nonviscous ﬂuid, internal friction is neglected.
An object moving through the ﬂuid experiences no viscous force.
2. The ﬂow is steady. In steady (laminar) ﬂow, the velocity of the ﬂuid at each
point remains constant.

Fluid Mechanics

3. The ﬂuid is incompressible. The density of an incompressible ﬂuid is constant.
4. The ﬂow is irrotational. In irrotational ﬂow, the ﬂuid has no angular momentum about any point. If a small paddle wheel placed anywhere in the ﬂuid does
not rotate about the wheel’s center of mass, then the ﬂow is irrotational.

Figure 15.16

A particle in laminar ﬂow follows a streamline, and
at each point along its path the particle’s velocity is tangent to the
streamline.

STREAMLINES AND THE EQUATION OF CONTINUITY

The path taken by a ﬂuid particle under steady ﬂow is called a streamline. The velocity of the particle is always tangent to the streamline, as shown in Figure 15.16.
A set of streamlines like the ones shown in Figure 15.16 form a tube of ﬂow. Note
that ﬂuid particles cannot ﬂow into or out of the sides of this tube; if they could,
then the streamlines would cross each other.
Consider an ideal ﬂuid ﬂowing through a pipe of nonuniform size, as illustrated in Figure 15.17. The particles in the ﬂuid move along streamlines in steady
ﬂow. In a time t, the ﬂuid at the bottom end of the pipe moves a distance
⌬x 1 ⫽ v 1t. If A1 is the cross-sectional area in this region, then the mass of ﬂuid
contained in the left shaded region in Figure 15.17 is m 1 ⫽ ␳A1 ⌬x 1 ⫽ ␳A1v 1t,
where ␳ is the (nonchanging) density of the ideal ﬂuid. Similarly, the ﬂuid that
moves through the upper end of the pipe in the time t has a mass m 2 ⫽ ␳A2v 2t.
However, because mass is conserved and because the ﬂow is steady, the mass that
crosses A1 in a time t must equal the mass that crosses A2 in the time t. That is,
m 1 ⫽ m 2, or ␳A1v 1t ⫽ ␳A2v 2t ; this means that
A1v 1 ⫽ A2v 2 ⫽ constant

Equation of continuity

(15.7)

This expression is called the equation of continuity. It states that
the product of the area and the ﬂuid speed at all points along the pipe is a constant for an incompressible ﬂuid.
This equation tells us that the speed is high where the tube is constricted (small A)
and low where the tube is wide (large A). The product Av, which has the dimensions of volume per unit time, is called either the volume ﬂux or the ﬂow rate. The
condition Av ⫽ constant is equivalent to the statement that the volume of ﬂuid
that enters one end of a tube in a given time interval equals the volume leaving
the other end of the tube in the same time interval if no leaks are present.

BERNOULLI’S EQUATION

When you press your thumb over the end of a garden hose so that the opening becomes a small slit, the water comes out at high speed, as shown in Figure 15.19. Is
the water under greater pressure when it is inside the hose or when it is out in the
air? You can answer this question by noting how hard you have to push your
thumb against the water inside the end of the hose. The pressure inside the hose
is deﬁnitely greater than atmospheric pressure.
The relationship between ﬂuid speed, pressure, and elevation was ﬁrst derived
in 1738 by the Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli. Consider the ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid
through a nonuniform pipe in a time t, as illustrated in Figure 15.20. Let us call
the lower shaded part section 1 and the upper shaded part section 2. The force exerted by the ﬂuid in section 1 has a magnitude P1 A1 . The work done by this force
in a time t is W 1 ⫽ F 1⌬x 1 ⫽ P1A1⌬x 1 ⫽ P1V, where V is the volume of section 1. In
a similar manner, the work done by the ﬂuid in section 2 in the same time t is
W 2 ⫽ ⫺P2A2⌬x 2 ⫽ ⫺P2V. (The volume that passes through section 1 in a time t
equals the volume that passes through section 2 in the same time.) This work is
negative because the ﬂuid force opposes the displacement. Thus, the net work
done by these forces in the time t is

(1700 – 1782)
Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss physicist
and mathematician, made important
discoveries in ﬂuid dynamics. Born
into a family of mathematicians, he
was the only member of the family to
make a mark in physics.
Bernoulli’s most famous work, Hydrodynamica, was published in 1738;
it is both a theoretical and a practical
study of equilibrium, pressure, and
speed in ﬂuids. He showed that as the
speed of a ﬂuid increases, its pressure decreases.
In Hydrodynamica Bernoulli also
attempted the ﬁrst explanation of the
behavior of gases with changing
pressure and temperature; this was
the beginning of the kinetic theory of
gases, a topic we study in Chapter 21.

into changing the gravitational potential energy. If m is the mass that enters one
end and leaves the other in a time t, then the change in the kinetic energy of this

Rearranging terms, we obtain
P1 ⫹ 12 ␳v 12 ⫹ ␳g y 1 ⫽ P2 ⫹ 12 ␳v 22 ⫹ ␳g y 2

This is Bernoulli’s equation as applied to an ideal ﬂuid. It is often expressed as

This expression speciﬁes that, in laminar ﬂow, the sum of the pressure (P), kinetic
energy per unit volume (12␳v 2), and gravitational potential energy per unit volume
( ␳ gy) has the same value at all points along a streamline.
When the ﬂuid is at rest, v 1 ⫽ v 2 ⫽ 0 and Equation 15.8 becomes
P1 ⫺ P2 ⫽ ␳g(y 2 ⫺ y 1) ⫽ ␳gh
This is in agreement with Equation 15.4.

known as a Venturi tube, can be used to measure the ﬂow
speed of an incompressible ﬂuid. Let us determine the ﬂow

We can use this result and the continuity equation to obtain an expression for v1 . Because A2 ⬍ A1 , Equation (2)
shows us that v 2 ⬎ v 1 . This result, together with equation
(1), indicates that P1 ⬎ P2 . In other words, the pressure is reduced in the constricted part of the pipe. This result is somewhat analogous to the following situation: Consider a very
crowded room in which people are squeezed together. As
soon as a door is opened and people begin to exit, the
squeezing (pressure) is least near the door, where the motion
(ﬂow) is greatest.

A Good Trick

It is possible to blow a dime off a table and into a tumbler.
Place the dime about 2 cm from the edge of the table. Place
the tumbler on the table horizontally with its open edge
about 2 cm from the dime, as shown in Figure 15.22a. If you
blow forcefully across the top of the dime, it will rise, be
caught in the airstream, and end up in the tumbler. The

mass of a dime is m ⫽ 2.24 g, and its surface area is
A ⫽ 2.50 ⫻ 10 ⫺4 m2. How hard are you blowing when the
dime rises and travels into the tumbler?

Solution Figure 15.22b indicates we must calculate the upward force acting on the dime. First, note that a thin stationary layer of air is present between the dime and the table.
When you blow across the dime, it deﬂects most of the moving air from your breath across its top, so that the air above
the dime has a greater speed than the air beneath it. This
fact, together with Bernoulli’s equation, demonstrates that
the air moving across the top of the dime is at a lower pressure than the air beneath the dime. If we neglect the small
thickness of the dime, we can apply Equation 15.8 to obtain
Pabove ⫹ 12 ␳v 2above ⫽ Pbeneath ⫹ 12 ␳v 2beneath

2 cm

Because the air beneath the dime is almost stationary, we can
neglect the last term in this expression and write the difference as Pbeneath ⫺ Pabove ⫽ 12 ␳v 2above . If we multiply this pressure difference by the surface area of the dime, we obtain the
upward force acting on the dime. At the very least, this upward force must balance the gravitational force acting on the
dime, and so, taking the density of air from Table 15.1, we
can state that

The air you blow must be moving faster than this if the upward force is to exceed the weight of the dime. Practice this
trick a few times and then impress all your friends!

An enclosed tank containing a liquid of density ␳ has a hole
in its side at a distance y1 from the tank’s bottom (Fig. 15.23).

When P is much larger than atmospheric pressure
P0 , the liquid speed as the liquid passes through the hole in the side
of the container is given approximately by v 1 ⫽ !2(P ⫺ P0)/␳.

When P is much greater than P0 (so that the term 2gh can
be neglected), the exit speed of the water is mainly a function
of P. If the tank is open to the atmosphere, then P ⫽ P0 and
v 1 ⫽ !2gh. In other words, for an open tank, the speed of liquid coming out through a hole a distance h below the surface is
equal to that acquired by an object falling freely through a vertical distance h. This phenomenon is known as Torricelli’s law.

Figure 15.24 Streamline ﬂow
around an airplane wing. The pressure above the wing is less than the
pressure below, and a dynamic lift
upward results.

OTHER APPLICATIONS OF BERNOULLI’S EQUATION

The lift on an aircraft wing can be explained, in part, by the Bernoulli effect. Airplane wings are designed so that the air speed above the wing is greater than that
below the wing. As a result, the air pressure above the wing is less than the pressure below, and a net upward force on the wing, called lift, results.
Another factor inﬂuencing the lift on a wing is shown in Figure 15.24. The
wing has a slight upward tilt that causes air molecules striking its bottom to be deﬂected downward. This deﬂection means that the wing is exerting a downward
force on the air. According to Newton’s third law, the air must exert an equal and
opposite force on the wing.
Finally, turbulence also has an effect. If the wing is tilted too much, the ﬂow of
air across the upper surface becomes turbulent, and the pressure difference across
the wing is not as great as that predicted by Bernoulli’s equation. In an extreme
case, this turbulence may cause the aircraft to stall.
In general, an object moving through a ﬂuid experiences lift as the result of
any effect that causes the ﬂuid to change its direction as it ﬂows past the object.
Some factors that inﬂuence lift are the shape of the object, its orientation with respect to the ﬂuid ﬂow, any spinning motion it might have, and the texture of its
surface. For example, a golf ball struck with a club is given a rapid backspin, as
shown in Figure 15.25a. The dimples on the ball help “entrain” the air to follow
the curvature of the ball’s surface. This effect is most pronounced on the top half
of the ball, where the ball’s surface is moving in the same direction as the air ﬂow.
Figure 15.25b shows a thin layer of air wrapping part way around the ball and being deﬂected downward as a result. Because the ball pushes the air down, the air
must push up on the ball. Without the dimples, the air is not as well entrained,

15.8 Other Applications of Bernoulli’s Equation

QuickLab
You can easily demonstrate the effect
of changing ﬂuid direction by lightly
holding the back of a spoon against a
stream of water coming from a
faucet. You will see the stream “attach” itself to the curvature of the
spoon and be deﬂected sideways. You
will also feel the third-law force exerted by the water on the spoon.

(b)

Figure 15.25

(a) A golf ball is made to spin when struck by the club.
(b) The spinning ball experiences a lifting force that allows it to travel
much farther than it would if it were not spinning.

and the golf ball does not travel as far. For the same reason, a tennis ball’s fuzz
helps the spinning ball “grab” the air rushing by and helps deﬂect it.
A number of devices operate by means of the pressure differentials that result
from differences in a ﬂuid’s speed. For example, a stream of air passing over one
end of an open tube, the other end of which is immersed in a liquid, reduces the
pressure above the tube, as illustrated in Figure 15.26. This reduction in pressure
causes the liquid to rise into the air stream. The liquid is then dispersed into a ﬁne
spray of droplets. You might recognize that this so-called atomizer is used in perfume bottles and paint sprayers. The same principle is used in the carburetor of a
gasoline engine. In this case, the low-pressure region in the carburetor is produced by air drawn in by the piston through the air ﬁlter. The gasoline vaporizes
in that region, mixes with the air, and enters the cylinder of the engine, where
combustion occurs.

SUMMARY
The pressure P in a ﬂuid is the force per unit area exerted by the ﬂuid on a surface:
F
P⬅
(15.1)
A
In the SI system, pressure has units of newtons per square meter (N/m2), and
1 N/m2 ⫽ 1 pascal (Pa).
The pressure in a ﬂuid at rest varies with depth h in the ﬂuid according to the
expression
P ⫽ P0 ⫹ ␳gh
(15.4)
where P0 is atmospheric pressure (⫽1.013 ⫻ 10 5 N/m2) and ␳ is the density of the
ﬂuid, assumed uniform.
Pascal’s law states that when pressure is applied to an enclosed ﬂuid, the
pressure is transmitted undiminished to every point in the ﬂuid and to every point
on the walls of the container.
When an object is partially or fully submerged in a ﬂuid, the ﬂuid exerts on
the object an upward force called the buoyant force. According to Archimedes’s
principle, the magnitude of the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the ﬂuid
displaced by the object. Be sure you can apply this principle to a wide variety of situations, including sinking objects, ﬂoating ones, and neutrally buoyant ones.
You can understand various aspects of a ﬂuid’s dynamics by assuming that the
ﬂuid is nonviscous and incompressible and that the ﬂuid’s motion is a steady ﬂow
with no rotation.
Two important concepts regarding ideal ﬂuid ﬂow through a pipe of nonuniform size are as follows:
1. The ﬂow rate (volume ﬂux) through the pipe is constant; this is equivalent to
stating that the product of the cross-sectional area A and the speed v at any
point is a constant. This result is expressed in the equation of continuity:
A1v 1 ⫽ A2v 2 ⫽ constant

(15.7)

You can use this expression to calculate how the velocity of a ﬂuid changes as
the ﬂuid is constricted or as it ﬂows into a more open area.
2. The sum of the pressure, kinetic energy per unit volume, and gravitational potential energy per unit volume has the same value at all points along a streamline. This result is summarized in Bernoulli’s equation:
P ⫹ 12 ␳v 2 ⫹ ␳gy ⫽ constant

15.1 You would be better off with the basketball player. Although weight is distributed over the larger surface area,
equal to about half of the total surface area of the
sneaker sole, the pressure (F/A) that he applies is relatively small. The woman’s lesser weight is distributed
over the very small cross-sectional area of the spiked
heel. Some museums make women in high-heeled shoes
wear slippers or special heel attachments so that they do
not damage the wood ﬂoors.
15.2 If the professor were to try to support his entire weight
on a single nail, the pressure exerted on his skin would
be his entire weight divided by the very small surface
area of the nail point. This extremely great pressure
would cause the nail to puncture his skin. However, if
the professor distributes his weight over several hundred
nails, as shown in the photograph, the pressure exerted
on his skin is considerably reduced because the surface
area that supports his weight is now the total surface
area of all the nail points. (Lying on the bed of nails is
much more comfortable than sitting on the bed, and
standing on the bed without shoes is deﬁnitely not recommended. Do not lie on a bed of nails unless you have
been shown how to do so safely.)
15.3 Because the horizontal force exerted by the outside
ﬂuid on an element of the cylinder is equal and opposite the horizontal force exerted by the ﬂuid on another
element diametrically opposite the ﬁrst, the net force on
the cylinder in the horizontal direction is zero.
15.4 If you think of the grain stored in the silo as a ﬂuid,
then the pressure it exerts on the walls increases with increasing depth. The spacing between bands is smaller at
the lower portions so that the greater outward forces acting on the walls can be overcome. The silo on the right
shows another way of accomplishing the same thing:
double banding at the bottom.

15.5 Because water is so much less dense than mercury, the
column for a water barometer would have to be
h ⫽ P0/␳g ⫽ 10.3 m high, and such a column is inconveniently tall.
15.6 The entire hull of a ship is full of air, and the density of
air is about one-thousandth the density of water.
Hence, the total weight of the ship equals the weight of
the volume of water that is displaced by the portion of
the ship that is below sea level.
15.7 Remains the same. In effect, the ice creates a “hole” in
the water, and the weight of the water displaced from
the hole is the same as all the weight of the cube.
When the cube changes from ice to water, the water
just ﬁlls the hole.
15.8 Goes down because the anchor displaces more water
while in the boat than it does in the pond. While it is in
the boat, the anchor can be thought of as a ﬂoating object that displaces a volume of water weighing as much
as it does. When the anchor is thrown overboard, it
sinks and displaces a volume of water equal to its own
volume. Because the density of the anchor is greater
than that of water, the volume of water that weighs the
same as the anchor is greater than the volume of the
anchor.
15.9 As the water falls, its speed increases. Because the ﬂow
rate Av must remain constant at all cross sections (see
Eq. 15.7), the stream must become narrower as the
speed increases.
15.10 The rapidly moving air characteristic of a tornado is at a
pressure below atmospheric pressure. The stationary air
inside the building remains at atmospheric pressure.
The pressure difference results in an outward force on
the roof and walls, and this force can be great enough
to lift the roof off the building. Opening the windows
helps to equalize the inside and outside pressures.

that draws a line on a slowly unrolling
strip of paper. The paper is mounted on a

ost of us experienced waves as children when we dropped a pebble into a
pond. At the point where the pebble hits the water’s surface, waves are created. These waves move outward from the creation point in expanding circles until they reach the shore. If you were to examine carefully the motion of a
leaf ﬂoating on the disturbed water, you would see that the leaf moves up, down,
and sideways about its original position but does not undergo any net displacement away from or toward the point where the pebble hit the water. The water
molecules just beneath the leaf, as well as all the other water molecules on the
pond’s surface, behave in the same way. That is, the water wave moves from the
point of origin to the shore, but the water is not carried with it.
An excerpt from a book by Einstein and Infeld gives the following remarks
concerning wave phenomena:1
A bit of gossip starting in Washington reaches New York [by word of mouth]
very quickly, even though not a single individual who takes part in spreading it
travels between these two cities. There are two quite different motions involved, that of the rumor, Washington to New York, and that of the persons
who spread the rumor. The wind, passing over a ﬁeld of grain, sets up a wave
which spreads out across the whole ﬁeld. Here again we must distinguish between the motion of the wave and the motion of the separate plants, which undergo only small oscillations... The particles constituting the medium perform
only small vibrations, but the whole motion is that of a progressive wave. The
essentially new thing here is that for the ﬁrst time we consider the motion of
something which is not matter, but energy propagated through matter.
The world is full of waves, the two main types being mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves. We have already mentioned examples of mechanical waves:
sound waves, water waves, and “grain waves.” In each case, some physical medium
is being disturbed — in our three particular examples, air molecules, water molecules, and stalks of grain. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium to propagate; some examples of electromagnetic waves are visible light, radio waves, television signals, and x-rays. Here, in Part 2 of this book, we study only mechanical waves.
The wave concept is abstract. When we observe what we call a water wave, what
we see is a rearrangement of the water’s surface. Without the water, there would
be no wave. A wave traveling on a string would not exist without the string. Sound
waves could not travel through air if there were no air molecules. With mechanical
waves, what we interpret as a wave corresponds to the propagation of a disturbance
through a medium.

CHAPTER 16

Wave Motion

The mechanical waves discussed in this chapter require (1) some source of
disturbance, (2) a medium that can be disturbed, and (3) some physical connection through which adjacent portions of the medium can inﬂuence each other. We
shall ﬁnd that all waves carry energy. The amount of energy transmitted through a
medium and the mechanism responsible for that transport of energy differ from
case to case. For instance, the power of ocean waves during a storm is much
greater than the power of sound waves generated by a single human voice.

BASIC VARIABLES OF WAVE MOTION

Imagine you are ﬂoating on a raft in a large lake. You slowly bob up and down as
waves move past you. As you look out over the lake, you may be able to see the individual waves approaching. The point at which the displacement of the water
from its normal level is highest is called the crest of the wave. The distance from
one crest to the next is called the wavelength  (Greek letter lambda). More generally, the wavelength is the minimum distance between any two identical
points (such as the crests) on adjacent waves, as shown in Figure 16.1.
If you count the number of seconds between the arrivals of two adjacent
waves, you are measuring the period T of the waves. In general, the period is the
time required for two identical points (such as the crests) of adjacent waves
to pass by a point.
The same information is more often given by the inverse of the period, which
is called the frequency f. In general, the frequency of a periodic wave is the number of crests (or troughs, or any other point on the wave) that pass a given
point in a unit time interval. The maximum displacement of a particle of the
medium is called the amplitude A of the wave. For our water wave, this represents
the highest distance of a water molecule above the undisturbed surface of the water as the wave passes by.
Waves travel with a speciﬁc speed, and this speed depends on the properties of
the medium being disturbed. For instance, sound waves travel through roomtemperature air with a speed of about 343 m/s (781 mi/h), whereas they travel
through most solids with a speed greater than 343 m/s.

16.2

DIRECTION OF PARTICLE DISPLACEMENT

One way to demonstrate wave motion is to ﬂick one end of a long rope that is under tension and has its opposite end ﬁxed, as shown in Figure 16.2. In this manner, a single wave bump (called a wave pulse) is formed and travels along the rope
with a deﬁnite speed. This type of disturbance is called a traveling wave, and Figure 16.2 represents four consecutive “snapshots” of the creation and propagation
of the traveling wave. The rope is the medium through which the wave travels.
Such a single pulse, in contrast to a train of pulses, has no frequency, no period,
and no wavelength. However, the pulse does have deﬁnite amplitude and deﬁnite
speed. As we shall see later, the properties of this particular medium that determine the speed of the wave are the tension in the rope and its mass per unit
length. The shape of the wave pulse changes very little as it travels along the rope.2
As the wave pulse travels, each small segment of the rope, as it is disturbed,
moves in a direction perpendicular to the wave motion. Figure 16.3 illustrates this
2

Strictly speaking, the pulse changes shape and gradually spreads out during the motion. This effect is
called dispersion and is common to many mechanical waves, as well as to electromagnetic waves. We do
not consider dispersion in this chapter.

point for one particular segment, labeled P. Note that no part of the rope ever
moves in the direction of the wave.
A traveling wave that causes the particles of the disturbed medium to move perpendicular to the wave motion is called a transverse wave.

Transverse wave

Compare this with another type of wave — one moving down a long, stretched
spring, as shown in Figure 16.4. The left end of the spring is pushed brieﬂy to the
right and then pulled brieﬂy to the left. This movement creates a sudden compression of a region of the coils. The compressed region travels along the spring (to
the right in Figure 16.4). The compressed region is followed by a region where the
coils are extended. Notice that the direction of the displacement of the coils is parallel to the direction of propagation of the compressed region.
A traveling wave that causes the particles of the medium to move parallel to the
direction of wave motion is called a longitudinal wave.
Sound waves, which we shall discuss in Chapter 17, are another example of
longitudinal waves. The disturbance in a sound wave is a series of high-pressure
and low-pressure regions that travel through air or any other material medium.

Figure 16.5 The motion of water molecules on the surface of deep water in which a wave is
propagating is a combination of transverse and longitudinal displacements, with the result that
molecules at the surface move in nearly circular paths. Each molecule is displaced both horizontally and vertically from its equilibrium position.

hole in the bottom of two paper cups,

string. If you speak into one cup
while pulling the string taut, a friend
can hear your voice in the other cup.
What kind of wave is present in the
string?

Some waves in nature exhibit a combination of transverse and longitudinal
displacements. Surface water waves are a good example. When a water wave travels
on the surface of deep water, water molecules at the surface move in nearly circular paths, as shown in Figure 16.5. Note that the disturbance has both transverse
and longitudinal components. The transverse displacement is seen in Figure 16.5
as the variations in vertical position of the water molecules. The longitudinal displacement can be explained as follows: As the wave passes over the water’s surface,
water molecules at the crests move in the direction of propagation of the wave,
whereas molecules at the troughs move in the direction opposite the propagation.
Because the molecule at the labeled crest in Figure 16.5 will be at a trough after
half a period, its movement in the direction of the propagation of the wave will be
canceled by its movement in the opposite direction. This holds for every other water molecule disturbed by the wave. Thus, there is no net displacement of any water molecule during one complete cycle. Although the molecules experience no net
displacement, the wave propagates along the surface of the water.
The three-dimensional waves that travel out from the point under the Earth’s
surface at which an earthquake occurs are of both types — transverse and longitudinal. The longitudinal waves are the faster of the two, traveling at speeds in the
range of 7 to 8 km/s near the surface. These are called P waves, with “P” standing
for primary because they travel faster than the transverse waves and arrive at a seismograph ﬁrst. The slower transverse waves, called S waves (with “S” standing for
secondary), travel through the Earth at 4 to 5 km/s near the surface. By recording
the time interval between the arrival of these two sets of waves at a seismograph,
the distance from the seismograph to the point of origin of the waves can be determined. A single such measurement establishes an imaginary sphere centered on
the seismograph, with the radius of the sphere determined by the difference in arrival times of the P and S waves. The origin of the waves is located somewhere on
that sphere. The imaginary spheres from three or more monitoring stations located far apart from each other intersect at one region of the Earth, and this region is where the earthquake occurred.

16.3 One-Dimensional Traveling Waves

16.3

ONE-DIMENSIONAL TRAVELING WAVES

Consider a wave pulse traveling to the right with constant speed v on a long, taut
string, as shown in Figure 16.6. The pulse moves along the x axis (the axis of the
string), and the transverse (vertical) displacement of the string (the medium) is
measured along the y axis. Figure 16.6a represents the shape and position of the
pulse at time t  0. At this time, the shape of the pulse, whatever it may be, can be
represented as y  f(x). That is, y, which is the vertical position of any point on the
string, is some deﬁnite function of x. The displacement y, sometimes called the
wave function, depends on both x and t. For this reason, it is often written y(x, t),
which is read “y as a function of x and t.” Consider a particular point P on the
string, identiﬁed by a speciﬁc value of its x coordinate. Before the pulse arrives at
P, the y coordinate of this point is zero. As the wave passes P, the y coordinate of
this point increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases to zero. Therefore,
the wave function y represents the y coordinate of any point P of the
medium at any time t.
Because its speed is v, the wave pulse travels to the right a distance vt in a time
t (see Fig. 16.6b). If the shape of the pulse does not change with time, we can represent the wave function y for all times after t  0. Measured in a stationary reference frame having its origin at O, the wave function is
y  f(x  vt)

Wave traveling to the right

(16.2)

Wave traveling to the left

If the wave pulse travels to the left, the string displacement is
y  f(x  vt)

For any given time t, the wave function y as a function of x deﬁnes a curve representing the shape of the pulse at this time. This curve is equivalent to a “snapshot” of the wave at this time. For a pulse that moves without changing shape, the
speed of the pulse is the same as that of any feature along the pulse, such as the
crest shown in Figure 16.6. To ﬁnd the speed of the pulse, we can calculate how far
the crest moves in a short time and then divide this distance by the time interval.
To follow the motion of the crest, we must substitute some particular value, say x 0 ,
in Equation 16.1 for x  vt. Regardless of how x and t change individually, we must
require that x  vt  x 0 in order to stay with the crest. This expression therefore
represents the equation of motion of the crest. At t  0, the crest is at x  x 0 ; at a

Solution

First, note that this function is of the form
y  f (x  vt ). By inspection, we see that the wave speed is
v  3.0 cm/s. Furthermore, the wave amplitude (the maximum value of y) is given by A  2.0 cm. (We ﬁnd the maximum value of the function representing y by letting
x  3.0t  0.) The wave function expressions are

We now use these expressions to plot the wave function versus x at these times. For example, let us evaluate y(x, 0) at
x  0.50 cm:

Likewise, at x  1.0 cm, y(1.0, 0)  1.0 cm, and at x 
2.0 cm, y(2.0, 0)  0.40 cm. Continuing this procedure for
other values of x yields the wave function shown in Figure
16.7a. In a similar manner, we obtain the graphs of y(x, 1.0)
and y(x, 2.0), shown in Figure 16.7b and c, respectively.
These snapshots show that the wave pulse moves to the right
without changing its shape and that it has a constant speed of
3.0 cm/s.

16.4 Superposition and Interference

16.4

SUPERPOSITION AND INTERFERENCE

Many interesting wave phenomena in nature cannot be described by a single moving pulse. Instead, one must analyze complex waves in terms of a combination of
many traveling waves. To analyze such wave combinations, one can make use of
the superposition principle:
If two or more traveling waves are moving through a medium, the resultant
wave function at any point is the algebraic sum of the wave functions of the individual waves.
Waves that obey this principle are called linear waves and are generally characterized by small amplitudes. Waves that violate the superposition principle are called
nonlinear waves and are often characterized by large amplitudes. In this book, we
deal only with linear waves.
One consequence of the superposition principle is that two traveling waves
can pass through each other without being destroyed or even altered. For instance, when two pebbles are thrown into a pond and hit the surface at different
places, the expanding circular surface waves do not destroy each other but rather
pass through each other. The complex pattern that is observed can be viewed as
two independent sets of expanding circles. Likewise, when sound waves from two
sources move through air, they pass through each other. The resulting sound that
one hears at a given point is the resultant of the two disturbances.
Figure 16.8 is a pictorial representation of superposition. The wave function
for the pulse moving to the right is y 1 , and the wave function for the pulse moving

assumed to be symmetric, and the displacement of the medium is in the positive y
direction for both pulses. (Note, however, that the superposition principle applies
even when the two pulses are not symmetric.) When the waves begin to overlap
(Fig. 16.8b), the wave function for the resulting complex wave is given by y 1  y 2 .

directions, where one pulse is inverted relative to the other.

16.5 The Speed of Waves on Strings

When the crests of the pulses coincide (Fig. 16.8c), the resulting wave given by
y 1  y 2 is symmetric. The two pulses ﬁnally separate and continue moving in their
original directions (Fig. 16.8d). Note that the pulse shapes remain unchanged, as
if the two pulses had never met!
The combination of separate waves in the same region of space to produce a
resultant wave is called interference. For the two pulses shown in Figure 16.8, the
displacement of the medium is in the positive y direction for both pulses, and the
resultant wave (created when the pulses overlap) exhibits a displacement greater
than that of either individual pulse. Because the displacements caused by the two
pulses are in the same direction, we refer to their superposition as constructive
interference.
Now consider two pulses traveling in opposite directions on a taut string
where one pulse is inverted relative to the other, as illustrated in Figure 16.9. In
this case, when the pulses begin to overlap, the resultant wave is given by y 1  y 2 ,
but the values of the function y 2 are negative. Again, the two pulses pass through
each other; however, because the displacements caused by the two pulses are in
opposite directions, we refer to their superposition as destructive interference.

THE SPEED OF WAVES ON STRINGS

In this section, we focus on determining the speed of a transverse pulse traveling
on a taut string. Let us ﬁrst conceptually argue the parameters that determine the
speed. If a string under tension is pulled sideways and then released, the tension is
responsible for accelerating a particular segment of the string back toward its equilibrium position. According to Newton’s second law, the acceleration of the segment increases with increasing tension. If the segment returns to equilibrium
more rapidly due to this increased acceleration, we would intuitively argue that the
wave speed is greater. Thus, we expect the wave speed to increase with increasing
tension.
Likewise, we can argue that the wave speed decreases if the mass per unit
length of the string increases. This is because it is more difﬁcult to accelerate a
massive segment of the string than a light segment. If the tension in the string is T
(not to be confused with the same symbol used for the period) and its mass per

the motion of a small segment of
the string in a moving frame of reference. (b) In the moving frame of

First, let us verify that this expression is dimensionally correct. The dimensions
of T are ML/T 2, and the dimensions of  are M/L. Therefore, the dimensions of
T/ are L2/T 2; hence, the dimensions of √T/ are L/T — indeed, the dimensions
of speed. No other combination of T and  is dimensionally correct if we assume
that they are the only variables relevant to the situation.
Now let us use a mechanical analysis to derive Equation 16.4. On our string
under tension, consider a pulse moving to the right with a uniform speed v measured relative to a stationary frame of reference. Instead of staying in this reference frame, it is more convenient to choose as our reference frame one that
moves along with the pulse with the same speed as the pulse, so that the pulse is at
rest within the frame. This change of reference frame is permitted because Newton’s laws are valid in either a stationary frame or one that moves with constant velocity. In our new reference frame, a given segment of the string initially to the
right of the pulse moves to the left, rises up and follows the shape of the pulse, and
then continues to move to the left. Figure 16.11a shows such a segment at the instant it is located at the top of the pulse.
The small segment of the string of length s shown in Figure 16.11a, and magniﬁed in Figure 16.11b, forms an approximate arc of a circle of radius R. In our
moving frame of reference (which is moving to the right at a speed v along with
the pulse), the shaded segment is moving to the left with a speed v. This segment
has a centripetal acceleration equal to v 2/R, which is supplied by components of
the tension T in the string. The force T acts on either side of the segment and tangent to the arc, as shown in Figure 16.11b. The horizontal components of T cancel, and each vertical component T sin  acts radially toward the center of the arc.
Hence, the total radial force is 2T sin . Because the segment is small,  is small,
and we can use the small-angle approximation sin  ⬇ . Therefore, the total radial force is
F r  2T sin  ⬇ 2T
The segment has a mass m  s. Because the segment forms part of a circle
and subtends an angle 2  at the center, s  R(2  ), and hence
m  s  2R

Solving for v gives Equation 16.4.
Notice that this derivation is based on the assumption that the pulse height is
small relative to the length of the string. Using this assumption, we were able to
use the approximation sin  ⬇ . Furthermore, the model assumes that the tension T is not affected by the presence of the pulse; thus, T is the same at all points
on the string. Finally, this proof does not assume any particular shape for the pulse.
Therefore, we conclude that a pulse of any shape travels along the string with speed
v  √T/ without any change in pulse shape.

Wave Motion

REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION

We have discussed traveling waves moving through a uniform medium. We now
consider how a traveling wave is affected when it encounters a change in the
medium. For example, consider a pulse traveling on a string that is rigidly attached to a support at one end (Fig. 16.13). When the pulse reaches the support,
a severe change in the medium occurs — the string ends. The result of this change
is that the wave undergoes reﬂection — that is, the pulse moves back along the
string in the opposite direction.
Note that the reﬂected pulse is inverted. This inversion can be explained as
follows: When the pulse reaches the ﬁxed end of the string, the string produces an
upward force on the support. By Newton’s third law, the support must exert an
equal and opposite (downward) reaction force on the string. This downward force
causes the pulse to invert upon reﬂection.
Now consider another case: this time, the pulse arrives at the end of a string that
is free to move vertically, as shown in Figure 16.14. The tension at the free end is
maintained because the string is tied to a ring of negligible mass that is free to slide
vertically on a smooth post. Again, the pulse is reﬂected, but this time it is not inverted. When it reaches the post, the pulse exerts a force on the free end of the
string, causing the ring to accelerate upward. The ring overshoots the height of the
incoming pulse, and then the downward component of the tension force pulls
the ring back down. This movement of the ring produces a reﬂected pulse that is
not inverted and that has the same amplitude as the incoming pulse.
Finally, we may have a situation in which the boundary is intermediate between these two extremes. In this case, part of the incident pulse is reﬂected and
part undergoes transmission — that is, some of the pulse passes through the
boundary. For instance, suppose a light string is attached to a heavier string, as
shown in Figure 16.15. When a pulse traveling on the light string reaches the
boundary between the two, part of the pulse is reﬂected and inverted and part is
transmitted to the heavier string. The reﬂected pulse is inverted for the same reasons described earlier in the case of the string rigidly attached to a support.
Note that the reﬂected pulse has a smaller amplitude than the incident pulse.
In Section 16.8, we shall learn that the energy carried by a wave is related to its amplitude. Thus, according to the principle of the conservation of energy, when the
pulse breaks up into a reﬂected pulse and a transmitted pulse at the boundary, the
sum of the energies of these two pulses must equal the energy of the incident
pulse. Because the reﬂected pulse contains only part of the energy of the incident
pulse, its amplitude must be smaller.

(b)

When a pulse traveling on a heavy string strikes the boundary between the
heavy string and a lighter one, as shown in Figure 16.16, again part is reﬂected and
part is transmitted. In this case, the reﬂected pulse is not inverted.
In either case, the relative heights of the reﬂected and transmitted pulses depend on the relative densities of the two strings. If the strings are identical, there is
no discontinuity at the boundary and no reﬂection takes place.
According to Equation 16.4, the speed of a wave on a string increases as the
mass per unit length of the string decreases. In other words, a pulse travels more
slowly on a heavy string than on a light string if both are under the same tension.
The following general rules apply to reﬂected waves: When a wave pulse travels
from medium A to medium B and vA Q vB (that is, when B is denser than A),
the pulse is inverted upon reﬂection. When a wave pulse travels from
medium A to medium B and vA P vB (that is, when A is denser than B), the
pulse is not inverted upon reﬂection.

SINUSOIDAL WAVES

In this section, we introduce an important wave function whose shape is shown in
Figure 16.17. The wave represented by this curve is called a sinusoidal wave because the curve is the same as that of the function sin  plotted against . The sinusoidal wave is the simplest example of a periodic continuous wave and can be
used to build more complex waves, as we shall see in Section 18.8. The red curve
represents a snapshot of a traveling sinusoidal wave at t  0, and the blue curve
represents a snapshot of the wave at some later time t. At t  0, the function describing the positions of the particles of the medium through which the sinusoidal
wave is traveling can be written

冢 2 x冣

y  A sin

冤 2

vt

v

(16.5)

where the constant A represents the wave amplitude and the constant  is the
wavelength. Thus, we see that the position of a particle of the medium is the same
whenever x is increased by an integral multiple of . If the wave moves to the right
with a speed v, then the wave function at some later time t is
y  A sin

That is, the traveling sinusoidal wave moves to the right a distance vt in the time t,
as shown in Figure 16.17. Note that the wave function has the form f(x  vt) and

so represents a wave traveling to the right. If the wave were traveling to the left, the
quantity x  vt would be replaced by x  vt, as we learned when we developed
Equations 16.1 and 16.2.
By deﬁnition, the wave travels a distance of one wavelength in one period T. Therefore, the wave speed, wavelength, and period are related by the expression
v

Substituting this expression for v into Equation 16.6, we ﬁnd that

y  A sin 2

(16.8)

This form of the wave function clearly shows the periodic nature of y. At any given
time t (a snapshot of the wave), y has the same value at the positions x, x  ,
x  2, and so on. Furthermore, at any given position x, the value of y is the same
at times t, t  T, t  2T, and so on.
We can express the wave function in a convenient form by deﬁning two other
quantities, the angular wave number k and the angular frequency :

in Chapter 13. This constant can be determined from the initial conditions.

A sinusoidal wave traveling in the positive x direction has an
amplitude of 15.0 cm, a wavelength of 40.0 cm, and a frequency of 8.00 Hz. The vertical displacement of the medium
at t  0 and x  0 is also 15.0 cm, as shown in Figure 16.18.

Solution Because A  15.0 cm and because y  15.0 cm
at x  0 and t  0, substitution into Equation 16.15 gives
15.0  (15.0) sin

or

We may take the principal value

By inspection, we can see that the wave function must have
this form, noting that the cosine function has the same shape
as the sine function displaced by 90°. Substituting the values
for A, k, and into this expression, we obtain
A sinusoidal wave of wavelength   40.0 cm and
amplitude A  15.0 cm. The wave function can be written in the
form y  A cos(kx  t ).

Sinusoidal Waves on Strings
In Figure 16.2, we demonstrated how to create a pulse by jerking a taut string up
and down once. To create a train of such pulses, normally referred to as a wave train,
or just plain wave, we can replace the hand with an oscillating blade. If the wave consists of a train of identical cycles, whatever their shape, the relationships f  1/T and
v  f  among speed, frequency, period, and wavelength hold true. We can make
more deﬁnite statements about the wave function if the source of the waves vibrates
in simple harmonic motion. Figure 16.19 represents snapshots of the wave created
in this way at intervals of T/4. Note that because the end of the blade oscillates in
simple harmonic motion, each particle of the string, such as that at P, also oscillates vertically with simple harmonic motion. This must be the case because
each particle follows the simple harmonic motion of the blade. Therefore, every segment of the string can be treated as a simple harmonic oscillator vibrating with a frequency equal to the frequency of oscillation of the blade.3 Note that although each
segment oscillates in the y direction, the wave travels in the x direction with a speed
v. Of course, this is the deﬁnition of a transverse wave.
3 In this arrangement, we are assuming that a string segment always oscillates in a vertical line. The tension in the string would vary if a segment were allowed to move sideways. Such motion would make the
analysis very complex.

One method for producing a train of sinusoidal wave pulses on a string. The left
end of the string is connected to a blade that is set into oscillation. Every segment of the string,
such as the point P, oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the vertical direction.

If the wave at t  0 is as described in Figure 16.19b, then the wave function
can be written as
y  A sin(kx  t)
We can use this expression to describe the motion of any point on the string. The
point P (or any other point on the string) moves only vertically, and so its x coordinate remains constant. Therefore, the transverse speed vy (not to be confused
with the wave speed v) and the transverse acceleration ay are

In these expressions, we must use partial derivatives (see Section 8.6) because y depends on both x and t. In the operation y/t, for example, we take a derivative
with respect to t while holding x constant. The maximum values of the transverse
speed and transverse acceleration are simply the absolute values of the coefﬁcients
of the cosine and sine functions:
v y, max  A

(16.18)

The transverse speed and transverse acceleration do not reach their maximum values simultaneously. The transverse speed reaches its maximum value ( A) when
y  0, whereas the transverse acceleration reaches its maximum value ( 2A) when
y  A. Finally, Equations 16.18 and 16.19 are identical in mathematical form to
the corresponding equations for simple harmonic motion, Equations 13.10 and
13.11.

RATE OF ENERGY TRANSFER BY SINUSOIDAL
WAVES ON STRINGS

As waves propagate through a medium, they transport energy. We can easily
demonstrate this by hanging an object on a stretched string and then sending a
pulse down the string, as shown in Figure 16.20. When the pulse meets the suspended object, the object is momentarily displaced, as illustrated in Figure 16.20b.
In the process, energy is transferred to the object because work must be done for
it to move upward. This section examines the rate at which energy is transported
along a string. We shall assume a one-dimensional sinusoidal wave in the calculation of the energy transferred.
Consider a sinusoidal wave traveling on a string (Fig. 16.21). The source of the
energy being transported by the wave is some external agent at the left end of the
string; this agent does work in producing the oscillations. As the external agent
performs work on the string, moving it up and down, energy enters the system of
the string and propagates along its length. Let us focus our attention on a segment
of the string of length x and mass m. Each such segment moves vertically with
simple harmonic motion. Furthermore, all segments have the same angular frequency and the same amplitude A. As we found in Chapter 13, the elastic potential energy U associated with a particle in simple harmonic motion is U  12ky 2,
where the simple harmonic motion is in the y direction. Using the relationship
2  k/m developed in Equations 13.16 and 13.17, we can write this as

∆m

potential energy of this segment is
U  12(m)

Because the mass per unit length of the string is   m/x, we can express the
potential energy of the segment as
U  12(x)

As the length of the segment shrinks to zero, x : dx, and this expression becomes a differential relationship:

THE LINEAR WAVE EQUATION

In Section 16.3 we introduced the concept of the wave function to represent waves
traveling on a string. All wave functions y(x, t) represent solutions of an equation
called the linear wave equation. This equation gives a complete description of the
wave motion, and from it one can derive an expression for the wave speed. Furthermore, the linear wave equation is basic to many forms of wave motion. In this
section, we derive this equation as applied to waves on strings.
Suppose a traveling wave is propagating along a string that is under a tension
T. Let us consider one small string segment of length x (Fig. 16.22). The ends of
the segment make small angles A and B with the x axis. The net force acting on
the segment in the vertical direction is
Because the angles are small, we can use the small-angle approximation sin  ⬇
tan  to express the net force as
F y ⬇ T(tan B  tan A)
However, the tangents of the angles at A and B are deﬁned as the slopes of the string
segment at these points. Because the slope of a curve is given by y/x, we have

This is the linear wave equation as it applies to waves on a string.
We now show that the sinusoidal wave function (Eq. 16.11) represents a solution of the linear wave equation. If we take the sinusoidal wave function to be of
the form y(x, t)  A sin(kx  t), then the appropriate derivatives are

This equation must be true for all values of the variables x and t in order for the
sinusoidal wave function to be a solution of the wave equation. Both sides of the
equation depend on x and t through the same function sin(kx  t). Because this
function divides out, we do indeed have an identity, provided that

This expression applies in general to various types of traveling waves. For waves on
strings, y represents the vertical displacement of the string. For sound waves, y corresponds to displacement of air molecules from equilibrium or variations in either
the pressure or the density of the gas through which the sound waves are propagating. In the case of electromagnetic waves, y corresponds to electric or magnetic
ﬁeld components.
We have shown that the sinusoidal wave function (Eq. 16.11) is one solution of
the linear wave equation (Eq. 16.26). Although we do not prove it here, the linear

wave equation is satisﬁed by any wave function having the form y  f(x vt). Furthermore, we have seen that the linear wave equation is a direct consequence of
Newton’s second law applied to any segment of the string.

SUMMARY
A transverse wave is one in which the particles of the medium move in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the wave velocity. An example is a wave on a
taut string. A longitudinal wave is one in which the particles of the medium move
in a direction parallel to the direction of the wave velocity. Sound waves in ﬂuids
are longitudinal. You should be able to identify examples of both types of waves.
Any one-dimensional wave traveling with a speed v in the x direction can be
represented by a wave function of the form
y  f(x

vt)

(16.1, 16.2)

where the positive sign applies to a wave traveling in the negative x direction and the
negative sign applies to a wave traveling in the positive x direction. The shape of the
wave at any instant in time (a snapshot of the wave) is obtained by holding t constant.
The superposition principle speciﬁes that when two or more waves move
through a medium, the resultant wave function equals the algebraic sum of the
individual wave functions. When two waves combine in space, they interfere to
produce a resultant wave. The interference may be constructive (when the individual displacements are in the same direction) or destructive (when the displacements are in opposite directions).

tension T is

A wave is totally or partially reﬂected when it reaches the end of the medium in
which it propagates or when it reaches a boundary where its speed changes discontinuously. If a wave pulse traveling on a string meets a ﬁxed end, the pulse is reﬂected and inverted. If the pulse reaches a free end, it is reﬂected but not inverted.
The wave function for a one-dimensional sinusoidal wave traveling to the

ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS
49. The “wave” is a particular type of wave pulse that can
sometimes be seen propagating through a large crowd
gathered at a sporting arena to watch a soccer or American football match (Fig. P16.49). The particles of the
medium are the spectators, with zero displacement corresponding to their being in the seated position and
maximum displacement corresponding to their being
in the standing position and raising their arms. When a
large fraction of the spectators participate in the wave
motion, a somewhat stable pulse shape can develop.
The wave speed depends on people’s reaction time,
which is typically on the order of 0.1 s. Estimate the order of magnitude, in minutes, of the time required for
such a wave pulse to make one circuit around a large

of position) is parallel to the direction in which the wave

Sound Waves

S

ound waves are the most important example of longitudinal waves. They can
travel through any material medium with a speed that depends on the properties of the medium. As the waves travel, the particles in the medium vibrate
to produce changes in density and pressure along the direction of motion of the
wave. These changes result in a series of high-pressure and low-pressure regions. If
the source of the sound waves vibrates sinusoidally, the pressure variations are also
sinusoidal. We shall ﬁnd that the mathematical description of sinusoidal sound
waves is identical to that of sinusoidal string waves, which was discussed in the previous chapter.
Sound waves are divided into three categories that cover different frequency
ranges. (1) Audible waves are waves that lie within the range of sensitivity of the human ear. They can be generated in a variety of ways, such as by musical instruments, human vocal cords, and loudspeakers. (2) Infrasonic waves are waves having
frequencies below the audible range. Elephants can use infrasonic waves to communicate with each other, even when separated by many kilometers. (3) Ultrasonic
waves are waves having frequencies above the audible range. You may have used a
“silent” whistle to retrieve your dog. The ultrasonic sound it emits is easily heard
by dogs, although humans cannot detect it at all. Ultrasonic waves are also used in
medical imaging.
We begin this chapter by discussing the speed of sound waves and then wave
intensity, which is a function of wave amplitude. We then provide an alternative description of the intensity of sound waves that compresses the wide range of intensities to which the ear is sensitive to a smaller range. Finally, we treat effects of the
motion of sources and/or listeners.

SPEED OF SOUND WAVES

Let us describe pictorially the motion of a one-dimensional longitudinal pulse
moving through a long tube containing a compressible gas (Fig. 17.1). A piston at
the left end can be moved to the right to compress the gas and create the pulse.
Before the piston is moved, the gas is undisturbed and of uniform density, as represented by the uniformly shaded region in Figure 17.1a. When the piston is suddenly pushed to the right (Fig. 17.1b), the gas just in front of it is compressed (as
represented by the more heavily shaded region); the pressure and density in this
region are now higher than they were before the piston moved. When the piston
comes to rest (Fig. 17.1c), the compressed region of the gas continues to move to
the right, corresponding to a longitudinal pulse traveling through the tube with

speed v. Note that the piston speed does not equal v. Furthermore, the compressed region does not “stay with” the piston as the piston moves, because the
speed of the wave may be greater than the speed of the piston.
The speed of sound waves depends on the compressibility and inertia of the
medium. If the medium has a bulk modulus B (see Section 12.4) and density ␳,
the speed of sound waves in that medium is

Speed of sound

It is interesting to compare this expression with Equation 16.4 for the speed of
transverse waves on a string, v ⫽ !T/␮. In both cases, the wave speed depends on
an elastic property of the medium — bulk modulus B or string tension T — and on
an inertial property of the medium — ␳ or ␮. In fact, the speed of all mechanical
waves follows an expression of the general form
v⫽

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. For
sound traveling through air, the relationship between wave speed and medium
temperature is

where 331 m/s is the speed of sound in air at 0°C, and TC is the temperature in
degrees Celsius. Using this equation, one ﬁnds that at 20°C the speed of sound in
air is approximately 343 m/s.
This information provides a convenient way to estimate the distance to a thunderstorm, as demonstrated in the QuickLab. During a lightning ﬂash, the temperature of a long channel of air rises rapidly as the bolt passes through it. This temperature increase causes the air in the channel to expand rapidly, and this
expansion creates a sound wave. The channel produces sound throughout its entire length at essentially the same instant. If the orientation of the channel is such
that all of its parts are approximately the same distance from you, sounds from the
different parts reach you at the same time, and you hear a short, intense thunderclap. However, if the distances between your ear and different portions of the
channel vary, sounds from different portions arrive at your ears at different times.
If the channel were a straight line, the resulting sound would be a steady roar, but
the zigzag shape of the path produces variations in loudness.

This typical value for the speed of sound in solids is much

This difference in speeds makes sense because the molecules
of a solid are bound together into a much more rigid structure than those in a gas and hence respond more rapidly to a
disturbance.

PERIODIC SOUND WAVES

This section will help you better comprehend the nature of sound waves. You will
learn that pressure variations control what we hear — an important fact for understanding how our ears work.
One can produce a one-dimensional periodic sound wave in a long, narrow
tube containing a gas by means of an oscillating piston at one end, as shown in
Figure 17.2. The darker parts of the colored areas in this ﬁgure represent re-

523

17.2 Periodic Sound Waves

gions where the gas is compressed and thus the density and pressure are above
their equilibrium values. A compressed region is formed whenever the piston is
pushed into the tube. This compressed region, called a condensation, moves
through the tube as a pulse, continuously compressing the region just in front
of itself. When the piston is pulled back, the gas in front of it expands, and the
pressure and density in this region fall below their equilibrium values (represented by the lighter parts of the colored areas in Fig. 17.2). These low-pressure
regions, called rarefactions, also propagate along the tube, following the condensations. Both regions move with a speed equal to the speed of sound in the
medium.
As the piston oscillates sinusoidally, regions of condensation and rarefaction
are continuously set up. The distance between two successive condensations (or
two successive rarefactions) equals the wavelength ␭. As these regions travel
through the tube, any small volume of the medium moves with simple harmonic
motion parallel to the direction of the wave. If s(x, t) is the displacement of a small
volume element from its equilibrium position, we can express this harmonic displacement function as
s(x, t) ⫽ s max cos(kx ⫺ ␻t)

(17.2)

where smax is the maximum displacement of the medium from equilibrium
(in other words, the displacement amplitude of the wave), k is the angular
wavenumber, and ␻ is the angular frequency of the piston. Note that the displacement of the medium is along x, in the direction of motion of the sound wave,
which means we are describing a longitudinal wave.
As we shall demonstrate shortly, the variation in the gas pressure ⌬P, measured from the equilibrium value, is also periodic and for the displacement function in Equation 17.2 is given by

Thus, we see that a sound wave may be considered as either a displacement
wave or a pressure wave. A comparison of Equations 17.2 and 17.3 shows that the
pressure wave is 90° out of phase with the displacement wave. Graphs of
these functions are shown in Figure 17.3. Note that the pressure variation is a maximum when the displacement is zero, and the displacement is a maximum when
the pressure variation is zero.

The volume of gas that has a thickness ⌬x in the horizontal direction and a crosssectional area A is Vi ⫽ A ⌬x. The change in volume ⌬V accompanying the pressure change is equal to A ⌬s, where ⌬s is the difference between the value of s at

From Equation 16.13, we can write k ⫽ ␻/v ; hence, ⌬P can be expressed as

Because the sine function has a maximum value of 1, we see that the maximum
value of the pressure variation is ⌬Pmax ⫽ ␳v␻s max (see Eq. 17.4), and we arrive at
Equation 17.3:

INTENSITY OF PERIODIC SOUND WAVES

In the previous chapter, we showed that a wave traveling on a taut string transports
energy. The same concept applies to sound waves. Consider a volume of air of
mass ⌬m and width ⌬x in front of a piston oscillating with a frequency ␻, as shown
in Figure 17.4. The piston transmits energy to this volume of air in the tube, and
the energy is propagated away from the piston by the sound wave.1 To evaluate the
rate of energy transfer for the sound wave, we shall evaluate the kinetic energy of
this volume of air, which is undergoing simple harmonic motion. We shall follow a
procedure similar to that in Section 16.8, in which we evaluated the rate of energy
transfer for a wave on a string.
As the sound wave propagates away from the piston, the displacement of any
volume of air in front of the piston is given by Equation 17.2. To evaluate the kinetic energy of this volume of air, we need to know its speed. We ﬁnd the speed by
taking the time derivative of Equation 17.2:
v(x, t) ⫽

⭸
⭸
s(x, t) ⫽
[s
cos(kx ⫺ ␻t)] ⫽ ␻s max sin(kx ⫺ ␻t)

Imagine that we take a “snapshot” of the wave at t ⫽ 0. The kinetic energy of a
given volume of air at this time is
⌬K ⫽ 12 ⌬mv 2 ⫽ 12 ⌬m(␻s max sin kx)2 ⫽ 12␳A ⌬x(␻s max sin kx)2
⫽ 12␳A ⌬x(␻s max)2 sin2 kx
where A is the cross-sectional area of the moving air and A ⌬x is its volume. Now,
as in Section 16.8, we integrate this expression over a full wavelength to ﬁnd the
total kinetic energy in one wavelength. Letting the volume of air shrink to inﬁnitesimal thickness, so that ⌬x : dx, we have

Although it is not proved here, the work done by the piston equals the energy carried away by the
wave. For a detailed mathematical treatment of this concept, see Chapter 4 in Frank S. Crawford, Jr.,

Thus, we see that the intensity of a periodic sound wave is proportional to the

(as in the case of a periodic string wave). This can also be written in terms of the
pressure amplitude ⌬Pmax ; in this case, we use Equation 17.4 to obtain

Hearing Limits

The faintest sounds the human ear can detect at a frequency
of 1 000 Hz correspond to an intensity of about 1.00 ⫻
10⫺12 W/m2 — the so-called threshold of hearing. The loudest
sounds the ear can tolerate at this frequency correspond to
an intensity of about 1.00 W/m2 — the threshold of pain. Determine the pressure amplitude and displacement amplitude associated with these two limits.

Solution First, consider the faintest sounds. Using Equation 17.6 and taking v ⫽ 343 m/s as the speed of sound
waves in air and ␳ ⫽ 1.20 kg/m3 as the density of air, we
obtain
⌬Pmax ⫽ !2␳vI

⫽ !2(1.20 kg/m3)(343 m/s)(1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺12 W/m2)
⫽ 2.87 ⫻ 10 ⫺5 N/m2

Because atmospheric pressure is about 105 N/m2, this result

tells us that the ear can discern pressure ﬂuctuations as small
as 3 parts in 1010 !
We can calculate the corresponding displacement amplitude by using Equation 17.4, recalling that ␻ ⫽ 2␲f (see Eqs.
16.10 and 16.12):

This is a remarkably small number! If we compare this result
for s max with the diameter of a molecule (about 10⫺10 m), we
see that the ear is an extremely sensitive detector of sound
waves.
In a similar manner, one ﬁnds that the loudest sounds the
human ear can tolerate correspond to a pressure amplitude
of 28.7 N/m2 and a displacement amplitude equal to
1.11 ⫻ 10 ⫺5 m.

TABLE 17.2
Sound Levels

The example we just worked illustrates the wide range of intensities the human ear
can detect. Because this range is so wide, it is convenient to use a logarithmic
scale, where the sound level ␤ (Greek letter beta) is deﬁned by the equation

冢 冣

I
␤ ⫽ 10 log
I0

(17.7)

The constant I0 is the reference intensity, taken to be at the threshold of hearing
(I 0 ⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺12 W/m2 ), and I is the intensity, in watts per square meter, at
the sound level ␤, where ␤ is measured in decibels (dB).2 On this scale, the
threshold of pain (I ⫽ 1.00 W/m2 ) corresponds to a sound level of ␤ ⫽
10 log[(1 W/m2 )/(10⫺12 W/m2 )] ⫽ 10 log(101 2 ) ⫽ 120 dB, and the threshold
of hearing corresponds to ␤ ⫽ 10 log[(10⫺12 W/m2 )/(10⫺12 W/m2 )] ⫽ 0 dB.
Prolonged exposure to high sound levels may seriously damage the ear.
Ear plugs are recommended whenever sound levels exceed 90 dB. Recent evidence suggests that “noise pollution” may be a contributing factor to high blood
pressure, anxiety, and nervousness. Table 17.2 gives some typical sound-level
values.

Sound Waves

SPHERICAL AND PLANE WAVES

If a spherical body oscillates so that its radius varies sinusoidally with time, a spherical sound wave is produced (Fig. 17.5). The wave moves outward from the source
at a constant speed if the medium is uniform.
Because of this uniformity, we conclude that the energy in a spherical wave
propagates equally in all directions. That is, no one direction is preferred over any
other. If ᏼav is the average power emitted by the source, then this power at any distance r from the source must be distributed over a spherical surface of area 4␲ r 2.
Hence, the wave intensity at a distance r from the source is
I⫽

ᏼav
ᏼav
⫽
A
4␲r 2

(17.8)

Because ᏼav is the same for any spherical surface centered at the source, we see
that the intensities at distances r 1 and r 2 are
I1 ⫽

ᏼav
4␲r 12

and

Therefore, the ratio of intensities on these two spherical surfaces is

This inverse-square law states that the intensity decreases in proportion to the
square of the distance from the source. Equation 17.5 tells us that the intensity is
proportional to s 2max . Setting the right side of Equation 17.5 equal to the right side

the wave fronts.

17.4 Spherical and Plane Waves

Wave fronts

Figure 17.7 Far away from a point source, the wave
fronts are nearly parallel planes, and the rays are
nearly parallel lines perpendicular to the planes.
Hence, a small segment of a spherical wave front is approximately a plane wave.

of Equation 17.8, we conclude that the displacement amplitude s max of a spherical
wave must vary as 1/r. Therefore, we can write the wave function ␺ (Greek letter
psi) for an outgoing spherical wave in the form

(17.9)

where s 0 , the displacement amplitude at unit distance from the source, is a constant parameter characterizing the whole wave.
It is useful to represent spherical waves with a series of circular arcs concentric
with the source, as shown in Figure 17.6. Each arc represents a surface over which
the phase of the wave is constant. We call such a surface of constant phase a wave
front. The distance between adjacent wave fronts equals the wavelength ␭. The radial lines pointing outward from the source are called rays.
Now consider a small portion of a wave front far from the source, as shown in
Figure 17.7. In this case, the rays passing through the wave front are nearly parallel
to one another, and the wave front is very close to being planar. Therefore, at distances from the source that are great compared with the wavelength, we can approximate a wave front with a plane. Any small portion of a spherical wave far
from its source can be considered a plane wave.
Figure 17.8 illustrates a plane wave propagating along the x axis, which means
that the wave fronts are parallel to the yz plane. In this case, the wave function depends only on x and t and has the form

That is, the wave function for a plane wave is identical in form to that for a onedimensional traveling wave.
The intensity is the same at all points on a given wave front of a plane wave.

Intensity Variations of a Point Source

A point source emits sound waves with an average power output of 80.0 W. (a) Find the intensity 3.00 m from the source.

Solution

A point source emits energy in the form of
spherical waves (see Fig. 17.5). At a distance r from the
source, the power is distributed over the surface area of a
sphere, 4␲ r 2. Therefore, the intensity at the distance r is
given by Equation 17.8:

THE DOPPLER EFFECT

Perhaps you have noticed how the sound of a vehicle’s horn changes as the vehicle
moves past you. The frequency of the sound you hear as the vehicle approaches
you is higher than the frequency you hear as it moves away from you (see QuickLab). This is one example of the Doppler effect.3
To see what causes this apparent frequency change, imagine you are in a boat
that is lying at anchor on a gentle sea where the waves have a period of T ⫽ 3.0 s.
This means that every 3.0 s a crest hits your boat. Figure 17.9a shows this situation,
with the water waves moving toward the left. If you set your watch to t ⫽ 0 just as
one crest hits, the watch reads 3.0 s when the next crest hits, 6.0 s when the third
crest hits, and so on. From these observations you conclude that the wave frequency is f ⫽ 1/T ⫽ (1/3.0) Hz. Now suppose you start your motor and head directly into the oncoming waves, as shown in Figure 17.9b. Again you set your watch
to t ⫽ 0 as a crest hits the front of your boat. Now, however, because you are moving toward the next wave crest as it moves toward you, it hits you less than 3.0 s after the ﬁrst hit. In other words, the period you observe is shorter than the 3.0-s period you observed when you were stationary. Because f ⫽ 1/T, you observe a
higher wave frequency than when you were at rest.
If you turn around and move in the same direction as the waves (see Fig.
17.9c), you observe the opposite effect. You set your watch to t ⫽ 0 as a crest hits
the back of the boat. Because you are now moving away from the next crest, more
than 3.0 s has elapsed on your watch by the time that crest catches you. Thus, you
observe a lower frequency than when you were at rest.
These effects occur because the relative speed between your boat and the
waves depends on the direction of travel and on the speed of your boat. When you
are moving toward the right in Figure 17.9b, this relative speed is higher than that
of the wave speed, which leads to the observation of an increased frequency. When
you turn around and move to the left, the relative speed is lower, as is the observed
frequency of the water waves.
Let us now examine an analogous situation with sound waves, in which the water waves become sound waves, the water becomes the air, and the person on the
boat becomes an observer listening to the sound. In this case, an observer O is
moving and a sound source S is stationary. For simplicity, we assume that the air is
also stationary and that the observer moves directly toward the source. The observer moves with a speed vO toward a stationary point source (vS ⫽ 0) (Fig.
17.10). In general, at rest means at rest with respect to the medium, air.

Now consider the situation in which the source is in motion and the observer
is at rest. If the source moves directly toward observer A in Figure 17.11a, the wave
fronts heard by the observer are closer together than they would be if the source
were not moving. As a result, the wavelength ␭⬘ measured by observer A is shorter
than the wavelength ␭ of the source. During each vibration, which lasts for a time

“I love hearing that lonesome wail

changes due to the Doppler effect.”

That is, the observed frequency is increased whenever the source is moving toward
the observer.
When the source moves away from a stationary observer, as is the case for observer B in Figure 17.11a, the observer measures a wavelength ␭⬘ that is greater than

A convenient rule concerning signs for you to remember when working with
all Doppler-effect problems is as follows:
The word toward is associated with an increase in observed frequency. The words
away from are associated with a decrease in observed frequency.

Although the Doppler effect is most typically experienced with sound waves, it
is a phenomenon that is common to all waves. For example, the relative motion of
source and observer produces a frequency shift in light waves. The Doppler effect
is used in police radar systems to measure the speeds of motor vehicles. Likewise,
astronomers use the effect to determine the speeds of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects relative to the Earth.

Sound Waves

The Noisy Siren

As an ambulance travels east down a highway at a speed of
33.5 m/s (75 mi/h), its siren emits sound at a frequency of
400 Hz. What frequency is heard by a person in a car traveling
west at 24.6 m/s (55 mi/h) (a) as the car approaches the ambulance and (b) as the car moves away from the ambulance?

Solution

(a) We can use Equation 17.17 in both cases, taking the speed of sound in air to be v ⫽ 343 m/s. As the ambulance and car approach each other, the person in the car
hears the frequency

17.5 The Doppler Effect

Figure 17.13 The V-shaped
bow wave of a boat is formed because the boat speed is greater
than the speed of the water
waves. A bow wave is analogous to
a shock wave formed by an airplane traveling faster than sound.

the wave front centered at S 0 reaches a radius of vt. In this same amount of time,
the source travels a distance vS t to Sn . At the instant the source is at Sn , waves are
just beginning to be generated at this location, and hence the wave front has zero
radius at this point. The tangent line drawn from Sn to the wave front centered on
S 0 is tangent to all other wave fronts generated at intermediate times. Thus, we see
that the envelope of these wave fronts is a cone whose apex half-angle ␪ is given by
sin ␪ ⫽

⫽

The ratio vS /v is referred to as the Mach number, and the conical wave front produced when vS ⬎ v (supersonic speeds) is known as a shock wave. An interesting
analogy to shock waves is the V-shaped wave fronts produced by a boat (the bow
wave) when the boat’s speed exceeds the speed of the surface-water waves (Fig.
17.13).
Jet airplanes traveling at supersonic speeds produce shock waves, which are responsible for the loud “sonic boom” one hears. The shock wave carries a great deal
of energy concentrated on the surface of the cone, with correspondingly great pressure variations. Such shock waves are unpleasant to hear and can cause damage to
buildings when aircraft ﬂy supersonically at low altitudes. In fact, an airplane ﬂying
at supersonic speeds produces a double boom because two shock fronts are
formed, one from the nose of the plane and one from the tail (Fig. 17.14). People
near the path of the space shuttle as it glides toward its landing point often report
hearing what sounds like two very closely spaced cracks of thunder.

With this formula you can determine the speed of a sound wave in many different
materials.
For sinusoidal sound waves, the variation in the displacement is given by
s(x, t) ⫽ s max cos(kx ⫺ ␻t)

(17.2)

and the variation in pressure from the equilibrium value is
⌬P ⫽ ⌬Pmax sin(kx ⫺ ␻t)

(17.3)

where ⌬Pmax is the pressure amplitude. The pressure wave is 90° out of phase
with the displacement wave. The relationship between s max and ⌬Pmax is given by
⌬Pmax ⫽ ␳v␻s max

The constant I 0 is a reference intensity, usually taken to be at the threshold of

QUESTIONS
1. Why are sound waves characterized as longitudinal?
2. If an alarm clock is placed in a good vacuum and then activated, no sound is heard. Explain.
3. A sonic ranger is a device that determines the position of
an object by sending out an ultrasonic sound pulse and
measuring how long it takes for the sound wave to return
after it reﬂects from the object. Typically, these devices
cannot reliably detect an object that is less than half a meter from the sensor. Why is that?
4. In Example 17.5, we found that a point source with a
power output of 80 W reduces to a sound level of 40 dB
at a distance of about 16 miles. Why do you suppose you
cannot normally hear a rock concert that is going on 16
miles away? (See Table 17.2.)
5. If the distance from a point source is tripled, by what factor does the intensity decrease?
6. Explain how the Doppler effect is used with microwaves
to determine the speed of an automobile.
7. Explain what happens to the frequency of your echo as
you move in a vehicle toward a canyon wall. What happens
to the frequency as you move away from the wall?
8. Of the following sounds, which is most likely to have a
sound level of 60 dB — a rock concert, the turning of a
page in this text, normal conversation, or a cheering
crowd at a football game?
9. Estimate the decibel level of each of the sounds in the
previous question.

10. A binary star system consists of two stars revolving about
their common center of mass. If we observe the light
reaching us from one of these stars as it makes one complete revolution, what does the Doppler effect predict will
happen to this light?
11. How can an object move with respect to an observer so
that the sound from it is not shifted in frequency?
12. Why is it not possible to use sonar (sound waves) to determine the speed of an object traveling faster than the
speed of sound in a given medium?
13. Why is it so quiet after a snowfall?
14. Why is the intensity of an echo less than that of the original sound?
15. If the wavelength of a sound source is reduced by a factor
of 2, what happens to its frequency? Its speed?
16. In a recent discovery, a nearby star was found to have a
large planet orbiting about it, although the planet could
not be seen. In terms of the concept of a system rotating
about its center of mass and the Doppler shift for light
(which is in many ways similar to that for sound), explain
how an astronomer could determine the presence of the
invisible planet.
17. A friend sitting in her car far down the road waves to you
and beeps her horn at the same time. How far away must
her car be for you to measure the speed of sound to two
signiﬁcant ﬁgures by measuring the time it takes for the

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
17.1 The only correct answer is (c). Although the speed of a
wave is given by the product of its wavelength and frequency, it is not affected by changes in either one. For
example, if the sound from a musical instrument increases in frequency, the wavelength decreases, and thus
v ⫽ ␭f remains constant. The amplitude of a sound
wave determines the size of the oscillations of air molecules but does not affect the speed of the wave through
the air.
17.2 The ground tremor represents a sound wave moving
through the Earth. Sound waves move faster through
the Earth than through air because rock and other
ground materials are much stiffer against compression.
Therefore — the vibration through the ground and the
sound in the air having started together — the vibration
through the ground reaches the observer ﬁrst.

17.3 Because the bottom of the bottle does not allow molecular motion, the displacement in this region is at its minimum value. Because the pressure variation is a maximum when the displacement is a minimum, the
pressure variation at the bottom is a maximum.
17.4 (a) 10 dB. If we call the intensity of each violin I, the total intensity when all the violins are playing is
I ⫹ 9I ⫽ 10I. Therefore, the addition of the nine violins
increases the intensity of the sound over that of one violin by a factor of 10. From Equation 17.7 we see that an
increase in intensity by a factor of 10 increases the
sound level by 10 dB. (b) 13 dB. The intensity is now increased by a factor of 20 over that of a single violin.
17.5 The Mach number is the ratio of the plane’s speed
(which does not change) to the speed of sound, which is
greater in the warm air than in the cold, as we learned

544

in Section 17.1 (see Quick Quiz 17.1). The denominator
of this fraction increases while the numerator stays constant. Therefore, the fraction as a whole — the Mach
number — decreases.
17.6 (a) In the reference frame of the air, the observer is
moving toward the source at the wind speed through stationary air, and the source is moving away from the observer with the same speed. In Equation 17.17, therefore, a plus sign is needed in both the numerator and

Superposition and Standing Waves

mportant in the study of waves is the combined effect of two or more waves
traveling in the same medium. For instance, what happens to a string when a
wave traveling along it hits a ﬁxed end and is reﬂected back on itself ? What is
the air pressure variation at a particular seat in a theater when the instruments of
an orchestra sound together?
When analyzing a linear medium — that is, one in which the restoring force
acting on the particles of the medium is proportional to the displacement of the
particles — we can apply the principle of superposition to determine the resultant
disturbance. In Chapter 16 we discussed this principle as it applies to wave pulses.
In this chapter we study the superposition principle as it applies to sinusoidal
waves. If the sinusoidal waves that combine in a linear medium have the same frequency and wavelength, a stationary pattern — called a standing wave — can be produced at certain frequencies under certain circumstances. For example, a taut
string ﬁxed at both ends has a discrete set of oscillation patterns, called modes of vibration, that are related to the tension and linear mass density of the string. These
modes of vibration are found in stringed musical instruments. Other musical instruments, such as the organ and the ﬂute, make use of the natural frequencies of
sound waves in hollow pipes. Such frequencies are related to the length and shape
of the pipe and depend on whether the pipe is open at both ends or open at one
end and closed at the other.
We also consider the superposition and interference of waves having different
frequencies and wavelengths. When two sound waves having nearly the same frequency interfere, we hear variations in the loudness called beats. The beat frequency corresponds to the rate of alternation between constructive and destructive interference. Finally, we discuss how any non-sinusoidal periodic wave can be
described as a sum of sine and cosine functions.

SUPERPOSITION AND INTERFERENCE OF
SINUSOIDAL WAVES

Imagine that you are standing in a swimming pool and that a beach ball is ﬂoating
a couple of meters away. You use your right hand to send a series of waves toward
the beach ball, causing it to repeatedly move upward by 5 cm, return to its original
position, and then move downward by 5 cm. After the water becomes still, you use
your left hand to send an identical set of waves toward the beach ball and observe
the same behavior. What happens if you use both hands at the same time to send
two waves toward the beach ball? How the beach ball responds to the waves depends on whether the waves work together (that is, both waves make the beach
ball go up at the same time and then down at the same time) or work against each
other (that is, one wave tries to make the beach ball go up, while the other wave
tries to make it go down). Because it is possible to have two or more waves in the
same location at the same time, we have to consider how waves interact with each
other and with their surroundings.
The superposition principle states that when two or more waves move in the
same linear medium, the net displacement of the medium (that is, the resultant
wave) at any point equals the algebraic sum of all the displacements caused by the
individual waves. Let us apply this principle to two sinusoidal waves traveling in the
same direction in a linear medium. If the two waves are traveling to the right and
have the same frequency, wavelength, and amplitude but differ in phase, we can

express their individual wave functions as

where, as usual, k ⫽ 2␲/␭, ␻ ⫽ 2␲f, and ␾ is the phase constant, which we introduced in the context of simple harmonic motion in Chapter 13. Hence, the resultant wave function y is
y ⫽ y 1 ⫹ y 2 ⫽ A[sin(kx ⫺ ␻t) ⫹ sin(kx ⫺ ␻t ⫹ ␾)]
To simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric identity

This result has several important features. The resultant wave function y also is sinusoidal and has the same frequency and wavelength as the individual waves, since the
sine function incorporates the same values of k and ␻ that appear in the original
wave functions. The amplitude of the resultant wave is 2A cos(␾/2), and its phase is
␾/2. If the phase constant ␾ equals 0, then cos(␾/2) ⫽ cos 0 ⫽ 1, and the amplitude of the resultant wave is 2A — twice the amplitude of either individual wave. In
this case, in which ␾ ⫽ 0, the waves are said to be everywhere in phase and thus interfere constructively. That is, the crests and troughs of the individual waves y 1 and
y 2 occur at the same positions and combine to form the red curve y of amplitude 2A
shown in Figure 18.1a. Because the individual waves are in phase, they are indistinguishable in Figure 18.1a, in which they appear as a single blue curve. In general,
constructive interference occurs when cos(␾/2) ⫽ ⫾1. This is true, for example,
when ␾ ⫽ 0, 2 ␲, 4 ␲, . . . rad — that is, when ␾ is an even multiple of ␲.
When ␾ is equal to ␲ rad or to any odd multiple of ␲, then cos(␾/2) ⫽
cos(␲/2) ⫽ 0, and the crests of one wave occur at the same positions as the
troughs of the second wave (Fig. 18.1b). Thus, the resultant wave has zero amplitude everywhere, as a consequence of destructive interference. Finally, when the
phase constant has an arbitrary value other than 0 or other than an integer multiple of ␲ rad (Fig. 18.1c), the resultant wave has an amplitude whose value is somewhere between 0 and 2A.

Interference of Sound Waves
One simple device for demonstrating interference of sound waves is illustrated in
Figure 18.2. Sound from a loudspeaker S is sent into a tube at point P, where there
is a T-shaped junction. Half of the sound power travels in one direction, and half
travels in the opposite direction. Thus, the sound waves that reach the receiver R
can travel along either of the two paths. The distance along any path from speaker
to receiver is called the path length r. The lower path length r 1 is ﬁxed, but the
upper path length r 2 can be varied by sliding the U-shaped tube, which is similar to
that on a slide trombone. When the difference in the path lengths ⌬r ⫽ 兩 r 2 ⫺ r 1 兩
is either zero or some integer multiple of the wavelength ␭ (that is, r ⫽ n␭, where
n ⫽ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), the two waves reaching the receiver at any instant are in
phase and interfere constructively, as shown in Figure 18.1a. For this case, a maximum in the sound intensity is detected at the receiver. If the path length r 2 is ad-

two waves are exactly ␲ rad, or 180°, out of phase at the receiver and hence cancel

receiver. This simple experiment demonstrates that a phase difference may arise
between two waves generated by the same source when they travel along paths of
unequal lengths. This important phenomenon will be indispensable in our investigation of the interference of light waves in Chapter 37.

18.1 Superposition and Interference of Sinusoidal Waves

It is often useful to express the path difference in terms of the phase angle ␾
between the two waves. Because a path difference of one wavelength corresponds

Two Speakers Driven by the Same Source

A pair of speakers placed 3.00 m apart are driven by the same
oscillator (Fig. 18.3). A listener is originally at point O, which
is located 8.00 m from the center of the line connecting the
two speakers. The listener then walks to point P, which is a
perpendicular distance 0.350 m from O, before reaching the
ﬁrst minimum in sound intensity. What is the frequency of the
oscillator?

Solution To ﬁnd the frequency, we need to know the
wavelength of the sound coming from the speakers. With this
information, combined with our knowledge of the speed of
sound, we can calculate the frequency. We can determine the
wavelength from the interference information given. The
ﬁrst minimum occurs when the two waves reaching the listener at point P are 180° out of phase — in other words, when
their path difference ⌬r equals ␭/2. To calculate the path difference, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd the path lengths r 1 and r 2 .
Figure 18.3 shows the physical arrangement of the speakers, along with two shaded right triangles that can be drawn
on the basis of the lengths described in the problem. From

these triangles, we ﬁnd that the path lengths are
r 1 ⫽ √(8.00 m)2 ⫹ (1.15 m)2 ⫽ 8.08 m
and
r 2 ⫽ √(8.00 m)2 ⫹ (1.85 m)2 ⫽ 8.21 m
Hence, the path difference is r 2 ⫺ r 1 ⫽ 0.13 m. Because we
require that this path difference be equal to ␭/2 for the ﬁrst
minimum, we ﬁnd that ␭ ⫽ 0.26 m.

Superposition and Standing Waves

You can now understand why the speaker wires in a stereo system should be
connected properly. When connected the wrong way — that is, when the positive
(or red) wire is connected to the negative (or black) terminal — the speakers are
said to be “out of phase” because the sound wave coming from one speaker destructively interferes with the wave coming from the other. In this situation, one
speaker cone moves outward while the other moves inward. Along a line midway
between the two, a rarefaction region from one speaker is superposed on a condensation region from the other speaker. Although the two sounds probably do
not completely cancel each other (because the left and right stereo signals are
usually not identical), a substantial loss of sound quality still occurs at points along
this line.

18.2

STANDING WAVES

The sound waves from the speakers in Example 18.1 left the speakers in the forward direction, and we considered interference at a point in space in front of the
speakers. Suppose that we turn the speakers so that they face each other and then
have them emit sound of the same frequency and amplitude. We now have a situation in which two identical waves travel in opposite directions in the same
medium. These waves combine in accordance with the superposition principle.
We can analyze such a situation by considering wave functions for two transverse sinusoidal waves having the same amplitude, frequency, and wavelength but
traveling in opposite directions in the same medium:
y 1 ⫽ A sin(kx ⫺ ␻t)

y 2 ⫽ A sin(kx ⫹ ␻t)

where y 1 represents a wave traveling to the right and y 2 represents one traveling to
the left. Adding these two functions gives the resultant wave function y:
y ⫽ y 1 ⫹ y 2 ⫽ A sin(kx ⫺ ␻t) ⫹ A sin(kx ⫹ ␻t)
When we use the trigonometric identity sin(a ⫾ b) ⫽ sin a cos b ⫾ cos a sin b, this
expression reduces to
Wave function for a standing wave

y ⫽ (2A sin kx) cos ␻t

(18.3)

which is the wave function of a standing wave. A standing wave, such as the one
shown in Figure 18.4, is an oscillation pattern with a stationary outline that results
from the superposition of two identical waves traveling in opposite directions.
Notice that Equation 18.3 does not contain a function of kx ⫾ ␻t. Thus, it is
not an expression for a traveling wave. If we observe a standing wave, we have no
sense of motion in the direction of propagation of either of the original waves. If
we compare this equation with Equation 13.3, we see that Equation 18.3 describes
a special kind of simple harmonic motion. Every particle of the medium oscillates
in simple harmonic motion with the same frequency ␻ (according to the cos ␻ t
factor in the equation). However, the amplitude of the simple harmonic motion of
a given particle (given by the factor 2A sin kx, the coefﬁcient of the cosine function) depends on the location x of the particle in the medium. We need to distinguish carefully between the amplitude A of the individual waves and the amplitude
2A sin kx of the simple harmonic motion of the particles of the medium. A given
particle in a standing wave vibrates within the constraints of the envelope function
2A sin kx, where x is the particle’s position in the medium. This is in contrast to
the situation in a traveling sinusoidal wave, in which all particles oscillate with the

antinodes. The antinodes are located at positions for which the coordinate x satisﬁes the condition sin kx ⫽ ⫾1, that is, when

later, at t ⫽ T/4 (Fig. 18.5b), the traveling waves have moved one quarter of a
wavelength (one to the right and the other to the left). At this time, the traveling

equilibrium position in its simple harmonic motion. The result is zero displacement for particles at all values of x — that is, the displacement pattern is a straight
line. At t ⫽ T/2 (Fig. 18.5c), the traveling waves are again in phase, producing a

Energy in a Standing Wave
It is instructive to describe the energy associated with the particles of a medium in
which a standing wave exists. Consider a standing wave formed on a taut string
ﬁxed at both ends, as shown in Figure 18.6. Except for the nodes, which are always
stationary, all points on the string oscillate vertically with the same frequency but
with different amplitudes of simple harmonic motion. Figure 18.6 represents snapshots of the standing wave at various times over one half of a period.
In a traveling wave, energy is transferred along with the wave, as we discussed
in Chapter 16. We can imagine this transfer to be due to work done by one segment of the string on the next segment. As one segment moves upward, it exerts a
force on the next segment, moving it through a displacement — that is, work is
done. A particle of the string at a node, however, experiences no displacement.
Thus, it cannot do work on the neighboring segment. As a result, no energy is
transmitted along the string across a node, and energy does not propagate in a
standing wave. For this reason, standing waves are often called stationary waves.
The energy of the oscillating string continuously alternates between elastic potential energy, when the string is momentarily stationary (see Fig. 18.6a), and kinetic energy, when the string is horizontal and the particles have their maximum
speed (see Fig. 18.6c). At intermediate times (see Fig. 18.6b and d), the string particles have both potential energy and kinetic energy.

STANDING WAVES IN A STRING
FIXED AT BOTH ENDS

Consider a string of length L ﬁxed at both ends, as shown in Figure 18.7. Standing
waves are set up in the string by a continuous superposition of waves incident on
and reﬂected from the ends. Note that the ends of the string, because they are
ﬁxed and must necessarily have zero displacement, are nodes by deﬁnition. The
string has a number of natural patterns of oscillation, called normal modes, each
of which has a characteristic frequency that is easily calculated.

harmonic series: (b) the fundamental, or ﬁrst harmonic; (c) the second harmonic;
(d) the third harmonic.
In general, the motion of an oscillating string ﬁxed at both ends is described
by the superposition of several normal modes. Exactly which normal modes are
present depends on how the oscillation is started. For example, when a guitar
string is plucked near its middle, the modes shown in Figure 18.7b and d, as well
as other modes not shown, are excited.
In general, we can describe the normal modes of oscillation for the string by imposing the requirements that the ends be nodes and that the nodes and antinodes
be separated by one fourth of a wavelength. The ﬁrst normal mode, shown in Figure
18.7b, has nodes at its ends and one antinode in the middle. This is the longestwavelength mode, and this is consistent with our requirements. This ﬁrst normal
mode occurs when the wavelength ␭1 is twice the length of the string, that is,
␭1 ⫽ 2L. The next normal mode, of wavelength ␭ 2 (see Fig. 18.7c), occurs when the
wavelength equals the length of the string, that is, ␭2 ⫽ L. The third normal mode
(see Fig. 18.7d) corresponds to the case in which ␭3 ⫽ 2L/3. In general, the wavelengths of the various normal modes for a string of length L ﬁxed at both ends are

where the index n refers to the nth normal mode of oscillation. These are the possible modes of oscillation for the string. The actual modes that are excited by a
given pluck of the string are discussed below.
The natural frequencies associated with these modes are obtained from the relationship f ⫽ v/␭, where the wave speed v is the same for all frequencies. Using
Equation 18.6, we ﬁnd that the natural frequencies fn of the normal modes are

Fundamental frequency of a taut
string

The frequencies of the remaining normal modes are integer multiples of the
fundamental frequency. Frequencies of normal modes that exhibit an integermultiple relationship such as this form a harmonic series, and the normal modes
are called harmonics. The fundamental frequency f 1 is the frequency of the ﬁrst
harmonic; the frequency f 2 ⫽ 2f 1 is the frequency of the second harmonic; and
the frequency f n ⫽ nf 1 is the frequency of the nth harmonic. Other oscillating systems, such as a drumhead, exhibit normal modes, but the frequencies are not related as integer multiples of a fundamental. Thus, we do not use the term harmonic
in association with these types of systems.
In obtaining Equation 18.6, we used a technique based on the separation distance between nodes and antinodes. We can obtain this equation in an alternative
manner. Because we require that the string be ﬁxed at x ⫽ 0 and x ⫽ L, the wave
function y(x, t) given by Equation 18.3 must be zero at these points for all times.
That is, the boundary conditions require that y(0, t) ⫽ 0 and that y(L, t) ⫽ 0 for all
values of t. Because the standing wave is described by y ⫽ (2A sin kx) cos ␻t, the
ﬁrst boundary condition, y(0, t) ⫽ 0, is automatically satisﬁed because sin kx ⫽ 0

Let us now examine how these various harmonics are created in a string. If we
wish to excite just a single harmonic, we need to distort the string in such a way
that its distorted shape corresponded to that of the desired harmonic. After being
released, the string vibrates at the frequency of that harmonic. This maneuver is
difﬁcult to perform, however, and it is not how we excite a string of a musical in1

We exclude n ⫽ 0 because this value corresponds to the trivial case in which no wave exists (k ⫽ 0).

strument. If the string is distorted such that its distorted shape is not that of just
one harmonic, the resulting vibration includes various harmonics. Such a distortion occurs in musical instruments when the string is plucked (as in a guitar),
bowed (as in a cello), or struck (as in a piano). When the string is distorted into a
non-sinusoidal shape, only waves that satisfy the boundary conditions can persist
on the string. These are the harmonics.
The frequency of a stringed instrument can be varied by changing either the
tension or the string’s length. For example, the tension in guitar and violin strings
is varied by a screw adjustment mechanism or by tuning pegs located on the neck
of the instrument. As the tension is increased, the frequency of the normal modes
increases in accordance with Equation 18.8. Once the instrument is “tuned,” players vary the frequency by moving their ﬁngers along the neck, thereby changing
the length of the oscillating portion of the string. As the length is shortened, the
frequency increases because, as Equation 18.8 speciﬁes, the normal-mode frequencies are inversely proportional to string length.

RESONANCE

We have seen that a system such as a taut string is capable of oscillating in one or
more normal modes of oscillation. If a periodic force is applied to such a system, the amplitude of the resulting motion is greater than normal when the
frequency of the applied force is equal to or nearly equal to one of the natural frequencies of the system. We discussed this phenomenon, known as resonance, brieﬂy in Section 13.7. Although a block – spring system or a simple pendulum has only one natural frequency, standing-wave systems can have a whole set of
natural frequencies. Because an oscillating system exhibits a large amplitude when
driven at any of its natural frequencies, these frequencies are often referred to as
resonance frequencies.
Figure 18.9 shows the response of an oscillating system to various driving frequencies, where one of the resonance frequencies of the system is denoted by f 0 .
Note that the amplitude of oscillation of the system is greatest when the frequency
of the driving force equals the resonance frequency. The maximum amplitude is
limited by friction in the system. If a driving force begins to work on an oscillating
system initially at rest, the input energy is used both to increase the amplitude of
the oscillation and to overcome the frictional force. Once maximum amplitude is
reached, the work done by the driving force is used only to overcome friction.
A system is said to be weakly damped when the amount of friction to be overcome is small. Such a system has a large amplitude of motion when driven at one
of its resonance frequencies, and the oscillations persist for a long time after the
driving force is removed. A system in which considerable friction must be overcome is said to be strongly damped. For a given driving force applied at a resonance
frequency, the maximum amplitude attained by a strongly damped oscillator is
smaller than that attained by a comparable weakly damped oscillator. Once the
driving force in a strongly damped oscillator is removed, the amplitude decreases
rapidly with time.

length. Whenever we use a series of regular impulses to push a child in a swing,
the swing goes higher if the frequency of the periodic force equals the natural fre-

quency of the swing. We can demonstrate a similar effect by suspending pendulums of different lengths from a horizontal support, as shown in Figure 18.10. If
pendulum A is set into oscillation, the other pendulums begin to oscillate as a result of the longitudinal waves transmitted along the beam. However, pendulum C,
the length of which is close to the length of A, oscillates with a much greater amplitude than pendulums B and D, the lengths of which are much different from
that of pendulum A. Pendulum C moves the way it does because its natural frequency is nearly the same as the driving frequency associated with pendulum A.
Next, consider a taut string ﬁxed at one end and connected at the opposite
end to an oscillating blade, as illustrated in Figure 18.11. The ﬁxed end is a node,
and the end connected to the blade is very nearly a node because the amplitude of
the blade’s motion is small compared with that of the string. As the blade oscillates, transverse waves sent down the string are reﬂected from the ﬁxed end. As we
learned in Section 18.3, the string has natural frequencies that are determined by
its length, tension, and linear mass density (see Eq. 18.8). When the frequency of
the blade equals one of the natural frequencies of the string, standing waves are
produced and the string oscillates with a large amplitude. In this resonance case,
the wave generated by the oscillating blade is in phase with the reﬂected wave, and
the string absorbs energy from the blade. If the string is driven at a frequency that
is not one of its natural frequencies, then the oscillations are of low amplitude and
exhibit no stable pattern.
Once the amplitude of the standing-wave oscillations is a maximum, the mechanical energy delivered by the blade and absorbed by the system is lost because
of the damping forces caused by friction in the system. If the applied frequency
differs from one of the natural frequencies, energy is transferred to the string at
ﬁrst, but later the phase of the wave becomes such that it forces the blade to receive energy from the string, thereby reducing the energy in the string.

STANDING WAVES IN AIR COLUMNS

Standing waves can be set up in a tube of air, such as that in an organ pipe, as the
result of interference between longitudinal sound waves traveling in opposite directions. The phase relationship between the incident wave and the wave reﬂected
from one end of the pipe depends on whether that end is open or closed. This relationship is analogous to the phase relationships between incident and reﬂected
transverse waves at the end of a string when the end is either ﬁxed or free to move
(see Figs. 16.13 and 16.14).
In a pipe closed at one end, the closed end is a displacement node because the wall at this end does not allow longitudinal motion of the air molecules. As a result, at a closed end of a pipe, the reﬂected sound wave is 180° out
of phase with the incident wave. Furthermore, because the pressure wave is 90° out
of phase with the displacement wave (see Section 17.2), the closed end of an air
column corresponds to a pressure antinode (that is, a point of maximum pressure variation).
The open end of an air column is approximately a displacement antinode2 and a pressure node. We can understand why no pressure variation occurs
at an open end by noting that the end of the air column is open to the atmosphere; thus, the pressure at this end must remain constant at atmospheric pressure.
2

Strictly speaking, the open end of an air column is not exactly a displacement antinode. A condensation reaching an open end does not reﬂect until it passes beyond the end. For a thin-walled tube of
circular cross section, this end correction is approximately 0.6R, where R is the tube’s radius. Hence,
the effective length of the tube is longer than the true length L. We ignore this end correction in this
discussion.

CHAPTER 18

Superposition and Standing Waves

You may wonder how a sound wave can reﬂect from an open end, since there
may not appear to be a change in the medium at this point. It is indeed true that
the medium through which the sound wave moves is air both inside and outside
the pipe. Remember that sound is a pressure wave, however, and a compression region of the sound wave is constrained by the sides of the pipe as long as
the region is inside the pipe. As the compression region exits at the open end
of the pipe, the constraint is removed and the compressed air is free to expand
into the atmosphere. Thus, there is a change in the character of the medium between the inside of the pipe and the outside even though there is no change in
the material of the medium. This change in character is sufﬁcient to allow some reﬂection.
The ﬁrst three normal modes of oscillation of a pipe open at both ends are
shown in Figure 18.14a. When air is directed against an edge at the left, longitudinal standing waves are formed, and the pipe resonates at its natural frequencies.
All normal modes are excited simultaneously (although not with the same amplitude). Note that both ends are displacement antinodes (approximately). In the
ﬁrst normal mode, the standing wave extends between two adjacent antinodes,

which is a distance of half a wavelength. Thus, the wavelength is twice the length
of the pipe, and the fundamental frequency is f 1 ⫽ v/2L. As Figure 18.14a shows,
the frequencies of the higher harmonics are 2f 1 , 3f 1 , . . . . Thus, we can say that
in a pipe open at both ends, the natural frequencies of oscillation form a harmonic series that includes all integral multiples of the fundamental frequency.
Because all harmonics are present, and because the fundamental frequency is
given by the same expression as that for a string (see Eq. 18.7), we can express the
natural frequencies of oscillation as

Despite the similarity between Equations 18.7 and 18.11, we must remember that v
in Equation 18.7 is the speed of waves on the string, whereas v in Equation 18.11 is
the speed of sound in air.
If a pipe is closed at one end and open at the other, the closed end is a displacement node (see Fig. 18.14b). In this case, the standing wave for the fundamental mode extends from an antinode to the adjacent node, which is one fourth
of a wavelength. Hence, the wavelength for the ﬁrst normal mode is 4L, and the
fundamental frequency is f 1 ⫽ v/4L. As Figure 18.14b shows, the higher-frequency
waves that satisfy our conditions are those that have a node at the closed end and
an antinode at the open end; this means that the higher harmonics have frequencies 3f 1 , 5f 1 , . . . :

It is interesting to investigate what happens to the frequencies of instruments
based on air columns and strings during a concert as the temperature rises. The
sound emitted by a ﬂute, for example, becomes sharp (increases in frequency) as
it warms up because the speed of sound increases in the increasingly warmer air
inside the ﬂute (consider Eq. 18.11). The sound produced by a violin becomes ﬂat
(decreases in frequency) as the strings expand thermally because the expansion
causes their tension to decrease (see Eq. 18.8).

Measuring the Frequency of a Tuning Fork

A simple apparatus for demonstrating resonance in an air
column is depicted in Figure 18.15. A vertical pipe open at
both ends is partially submerged in water, and a tuning fork
vibrating at an unknown frequency is placed near the top of
the pipe. The length L of the air column can be adjusted by
moving the pipe vertically. The sound waves generated by the
fork are reinforced when L corresponds to one of the resonance frequencies of the pipe.
For a certain tube, the smallest value of L for which a peak
occurs in the sound intensity is 9.00 cm. What are (a) the frequency of the tuning fork and (b) the value of L for the next
two resonance frequencies?

Solution (a) Although the pipe is open at its lower end to
allow the water to enter, the water’s surface acts like a wall at
one end. Therefore, this setup represents a pipe closed at
one end, and so the fundamental frequency is f 1 ⫽ v/4L.

Optional Section

STANDING WAVES IN RODS AND PLATES

Standing waves can also be set up in rods and plates. A rod clamped in the middle
and stroked at one end oscillates, as depicted in Figure 18.16a. The oscillations of
the particles of the rod are longitudinal, and so the broken lines in Figure 18.16
represent longitudinal displacements of various parts of the rod. For clarity, we have
drawn them in the transverse direction, just as we did for air columns. The midpoint is a displacement node because it is ﬁxed by the clamp, whereas the ends are
displacement antinodes because they are free to oscillate. The oscillations in this
setup are analogous to those in a pipe open at both ends. The broken lines in Figure 18.16a represent the ﬁrst normal mode, for which the wavelength is 2L and
the frequency is f ⫽ v/2L, where v is the speed of longitudinal waves in the rod.
Other normal modes may be excited by clamping the rod at different points. For
example, the second normal mode (Fig. 18.16b) is excited by clamping the rod a
distance L/4 away from one end.
Two-dimensional oscillations can be set up in a ﬂexible membrane stretched
over a circular hoop, such as that in a drumhead. As the membrane is struck at
some point, wave pulses that arrive at the ﬁxed boundary are reﬂected many times.
The resulting sound is not harmonic because the oscillating drumhead and the
drum’s hollow interior together produce a set of standing waves having frequencies that are not related by integer multiples. Without this relationship, the sound
may be more correctly described as noise than as music. This is in contrast to the
situation in wind and stringed instruments, which produce sounds that we describe as musical.
Some possible normal modes of oscillation for a two-dimensional circular
membrane are shown in Figure 18.17. The lowest normal mode, which has a frequency f 1, contains only one nodal curve; this curve runs around the outer edge of
the membrane. The other possible normal modes show additional nodal curves
that are circles and straight lines across the diameter of the membrane.

BEATS: INTERFERENCE IN TIME

The interference phenomena with which we have been dealing so far involve the
superposition of two or more waves having the same frequency. Because the resultant wave depends on the coordinates of the disturbed medium, we refer to the
phenomenon as spatial interference. Standing waves in strings and pipes are common examples of spatial interference.
We now consider another type of interference, one that results from the superposition of two waves having slightly different frequencies. In this case, when the
two waves are observed at the point of superposition, they are periodically in and
out of phase. That is, there is a temporal (time) alternation between constructive
and destructive interference. Thus, we refer to this phenomenon as interference in
time or temporal interference. For example, if two tuning forks of slightly different frequencies are struck, one hears a sound of periodically varying intensity. This phenomenon is called beating:
Deﬁnition of beating

Beating is the periodic variation in intensity at a given point due to the superposition of two waves having slightly different frequencies.

18.7 Beats: Interference in Time

565

The number of intensity maxima one hears per second, or the beat frequency, equals
the difference in frequency between the two sources, as we shall show below. The
maximum beat frequency that the human ear can detect is about 20 beats/s.
When the beat frequency exceeds this value, the beats blend indistinguishably with
the compound sounds producing them.
A piano tuner can use beats to tune a stringed instrument by “beating” a note
against a reference tone of known frequency. The tuner can then adjust the string
tension until the frequency of the sound it emits equals the frequency of the reference tone. The tuner does this by tightening or loosening the string until the beats
produced by it and the reference source become too infrequent to notice.
Consider two sound waves of equal amplitude traveling through a medium
with slightly different frequencies f 1 and f 2 . We use equations similar to Equation
16.11 to represent the wave functions for these two waves at a point that we choose
as x ⫽ 0:
y 1 ⫽ A cos ␻ 1t ⫽ A cos 2␲f 1t
y 2 ⫽ A cos ␻ 2t ⫽ A cos 2␲f 2t
Using the superposition principle, we ﬁnd that the resultant wave function at this
point is
y ⫽ y 1 ⫹ y 2 ⫽ A(cos 2␲f 1t ⫹ cos 2␲f 2t)
The trigonometric identity

Graphs of the individual waves and the resultant wave are shown in Figure 18.18.
From the factors in Equation 18.13, we see that the resultant sound for a listener
standing at any given point has an effective frequency equal to the average
frequency ( f 1 ⫹ f 2)/2 and an amplitude given by the expression in the square

That is, the amplitude and therefore the intensity of the resultant sound vary
in time. The broken blue line in Figure 18.18b is a graphical representation of
Equation 18.14 and is a sine wave varying with frequency ( f 1 ⫺ f 2)/2.

This means there are two maxima in each period of the resultant wave. Because

For instance, if one tuning fork vibrates at 438 Hz and a second one vibrates at
442 Hz, the resultant sound wave of the combination has a frequency of 440 Hz
(the musical note A) and a beat frequency of 4 Hz. A listener would hear a
440-Hz sound wave go through an intensity maximum four times every second.

NON-SINUSOIDAL WAVE PATTERNS

The sound-wave patterns produced by the majority of musical instruments are
non-sinusoidal. Characteristic patterns produced by a tuning fork, a ﬂute, and a
clarinet, each playing the same note, are shown in Figure 18.19. Each instrument
has its own characteristic pattern. Note, however, that despite the differences in
the patterns, each pattern is periodic. This point is important for our analysis of
these waves, which we now discuss.
We can distinguish the sounds coming from a trumpet and a saxophone even
when they are both playing the same note. On the other hand, we may have difﬁculty distinguishing a note played on a clarinet from the same note played on an
oboe. We can use the pattern of the sound waves from various sources to explain
these effects.
The wave patterns produced by a musical instrument are the result of the superposition of various harmonics. This superposition results in the corresponding
richness of musical tones. The human perceptive response associated with various
mixtures of harmonics is the quality or timbre of the sound. For instance, the sound
of the trumpet is perceived to have a “brassy” quality (that is, we have learned to
associate the adjective brassy with that sound); this quality enables us to distinguish
the sound of the trumpet from that of the saxophone, whose quality is perceived
as “reedy.” The clarinet and oboe, however, are both straight air columns excited
by reeds; because of this similarity, it is more difﬁcult for the ear to distinguish
them on the basis of their sound quality.
The problem of analyzing non-sinusoidal wave patterns appears at ﬁrst sight to
be a formidable task. However, if the wave pattern is periodic, it can be represented as closely as desired by the combination of a sufﬁciently large number of si-

nusoidal waves that form a harmonic series. In fact, we can represent any periodic
function as a series of sine and cosine terms by using a mathematical technique
based on Fourier’s theorem.3 The corresponding sum of terms that represents
the periodic wave pattern is called a Fourier series.
Let y(t) be any function that is periodic in time with period T, such that
y(t ⫹ T ) ⫽ y(t). Fourier’s theorem states that this function can be written as
y(t) ⫽ ⌺ (An sin 2␲f nt ⫹ Bn cos 2␲f nt)

(18.16)

n

where the lowest frequency is f 1 ⫽ 1/T. The higher frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental, f n ⫽ nf 1 , and the coefﬁcients An and Bn represent the
amplitudes of the various waves. Figure 18.20 represents a harmonic analysis of the
wave patterns shown in Figure 18.19. Note that a struck tuning fork produces only
one harmonic (the ﬁrst), whereas the ﬂute and clarinet produce the ﬁrst and
many higher ones.
Note the variation in relative intensity of the various harmonics for the ﬂute
and the clarinet. In general, any musical sound consists of a fundamental frequency f plus other frequencies that are integer multiples of f, all having different
intensities.
We have discussed the analysis of a wave pattern using Fourier’s theorem. The
analysis involves determining the coefﬁcients of the harmonics in Equation 18.16
from a knowledge of the wave pattern. The reverse process, called Fourier synthesis,
can also be performed. In this process, the various harmonics are added together
to form a resultant wave pattern. As an example of Fourier synthesis, consider the
building of a square wave, as shown in Figure 18.21. The symmetry of the square
wave results in only odd multiples of the fundamental frequency combining in its
synthesis. In Figure 18.21a, the orange curve shows the combination of f and 3f. In
Figure 18.21b, we have added 5f to the combination and obtained the green
curve. Notice how the general shape of the square wave is approximated, even
though the upper and lower portions are not ﬂat as they should be.

This synthesizer can produce the
characteristic sounds of different
instruments by properly combining
frequencies from electronic oscillators.

Figure 18.21c shows the result of adding odd frequencies up to 9f. This approximation to the square wave (purple curve) is better than the approximations in
parts a and b. To approximate the square wave as closely as possible, we would need
to add all odd multiples of the fundamental frequency, up to inﬁnite frequency.
Using modern technology, we can generate musical sounds electronically by
mixing different amplitudes of any number of harmonics. These widely used electronic music synthesizers are capable of producing an inﬁnite variety of musical
tones.

SUMMARY
When two traveling waves having equal amplitudes and frequencies superimpose,
the resultant wave has an amplitude that depends on the phase angle ␾ between

the two waves. Constructive interference occurs when the two waves are in
phase, corresponding to ␾ ⫽ 0, 2␲, 4␲, . . . rad. Destructive interference
occurs when the two waves are 180° out of phase, corresponding to
␾ ⫽ ␲, 3␲, 5␲, . . . rad. Given two wave functions, you should be able to determine which if either of these two situations applies.
Standing waves are formed from the superposition of two sinusoidal waves
having the same frequency, amplitude, and wavelength but traveling in opposite
directions. The resultant standing wave is described by the wave function
y ⫽ (2A sin kx) cos ␻t

(18.3)

Hence, the amplitude of the standing wave is 2A, and the amplitude of the simple
harmonic motion of any particle of the medium varies according to its position as
2A sin kx. The points of zero amplitude (called nodes) occur at x ⫽ n␭/2 (n ⫽ 0,
1, 2, 3, . . . ). The maximum amplitude points (called antinodes) occur at
x ⫽ n␭/4 (n ⫽ 1, 3, 5, . . . ). Adjacent antinodes are separated by a distance ␭/2.
Adjacent nodes also are separated by a distance ␭/2. You should be able to sketch
the standing-wave pattern resulting from the superposition of two traveling waves.

An oscillating system is in resonance with some driving force whenever the
frequency of the driving force matches one of the natural frequencies of the system. When the system is resonating, it responds by oscillating with a relatively large
amplitude.

sinusoidal waves?

When the base of a vibrating tuning fork is placed against
a chalkboard, the sound that it emits becomes louder.
This is due to the fact that the vibrations of the tuning
fork are transmitted to the chalkboard. Because it has a
larger area than that of the tuning fork, the vibrating

I

n our study of mechanics, we carefully deﬁned such concepts as mass, force,
and kinetic energy to facilitate our quantitative approach. Likewise, a quantitative description of thermal phenomena requires a careful deﬁnition of such important terms as temperature, heat, and internal energy. This chapter begins with a
look at these three entities and with a description of one of the laws of thermodynamics (the poetically named “zeroth law”). We then discuss the three most common temperature scales — Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Next, we consider why the composition of a body is an important factor when
we are dealing with thermal phenomena. For example, gases expand appreciably
when heated, whereas liquids and solids expand only slightly. If a gas is not free to
expand as it is heated, its pressure increases. Certain substances may melt, boil,
burn, or explode when they are heated, depending on their composition and
structure.
This chapter concludes with a study of ideal gases on the macroscopic scale.
Here, we are concerned with the relationships among such quantities as pressure,
volume, and temperature. Later on, in Chapter 21, we shall examine gases on a
microscopic scale, using a model that represents the components of a gas as small
particles.

TEMPERATURE AND THE ZEROTH LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS

We often associate the concept of temperature with how hot or cold an object feels
when we touch it. Thus, our senses provide us with a qualitative indication of temperature. However, our senses are unreliable and often mislead us. For example, if
we remove a metal ice tray and a cardboard box of frozen vegetables from the
freezer, the ice tray feels colder than the box even though both are at the same
temperature. The two objects feel different because metal is a better thermal conductor than cardboard is. What we need, therefore, is a reliable and reproducible
method for establishing the relative hotness or coldness of bodies. Scientists have
developed a variety of thermometers for making such quantitative measurements.
We are all familiar with the fact that two objects at different initial temperatures eventually reach some intermediate temperature when placed in contact
with each other. For example, when a scoop of ice cream is placed in a roomtemperature glass bowl, the ice cream melts and the temperature of the bowl decreases. Likewise, when an ice cube is dropped into a cup of hot coffee, it melts
and the coffee’s temperature decreases.
To understand the concept of temperature, it is useful to deﬁne two oftenused phrases: thermal contact and thermal equilibrium. To grasp the meaning of thermal contact, let us imagine that two objects are placed in an insulated container
such that they interact with each other but not with the rest of the world. If the objects are at different temperatures, energy is exchanged between them, even if
they are initially not in physical contact with each other. Heat is the transfer of
energy from one object to another object as a result of a difference in temperature between the two. We shall examine the concept of heat in greater detail in Chapter 20. For purposes of the current discussion, we assume that two objects are in thermal contact with each other if energy can be exchanged between
them. Thermal equilibrium is a situation in which two objects in thermal contact
with each other cease to exchange energy by the process of heat.
Let us consider two objects A and B, which are not in thermal contact, and a
third object C, which is our thermometer. We wish to determine whether A and B

are in thermal equilibrium with each other. The thermometer (object C) is ﬁrst
placed in thermal contact with object A until thermal equilibrium is reached.
From that moment on, the thermometer’s reading remains constant, and we
record this reading. The thermometer is then removed from object A and placed
in thermal contact with object B. The reading is again recorded after thermal
equilibrium is reached. If the two readings are the same, then object A and object
B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
We can summarize these results in a statement known as the zeroth law of
thermodynamics (the law of equilibrium):
Zeroth law of thermodynamics

If objects A and B are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third object C,
then objects A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
This statement can easily be proved experimentally and is very important because
it enables us to deﬁne temperature. We can think of temperature as the property
that determines whether an object is in thermal equilibrium with other objects.
Two objects in thermal equilibrium with each other are at the same temperature. Conversely, if two objects have different temperatures, then they are not in
thermal equilibrium with each other.

THERMOMETERS AND THE CELSIUS
TEMPERATURE SCALE

Thermometers are devices that are used to deﬁne and measure temperatures. All
thermometers are based on the principle that some physical property of a system
changes as the system’s temperature changes. Some physical properties that
change with temperature are (1) the volume of a liquid, (2) the length of a solid,
(3) the pressure of a gas at constant volume, (4) the volume of a gas at constant
pressure, (5) the electric resistance of a conductor, and (6) the color of an object.
For a given substance and a given temperature range, a temperature scale can be
established on the basis of any one of these physical properties.
A common thermometer in everyday use consists of a mass of liquid — usually
mercury or alcohol — that expands into a glass capillary tube when heated (Fig.
19.1). In this case the physical property is the change in volume of a liquid. Any
temperature change can be deﬁned as being proportional to the change in length
of the liquid column. The thermometer can be calibrated by placing it in thermal
contact with some natural systems that remain at constant temperature. One such
system is a mixture of water and ice in thermal equilibrium at atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius temperature scale, this mixture is deﬁned to have a temperature of zero degrees Celsius, which is written as 0°C; this temperature is called
the ice point of water. Another commonly used system is a mixture of water and
steam in thermal equilibrium at atmospheric pressure; its temperature is 100°C,
which is the steam point of water. Once the liquid levels in the thermometer have
been established at these two points, the distance between the two points is divided into 100 equal segments to create the Celsius scale. Thus, each segment denotes a change in temperature of one Celsius degree. (This temperature scale
used to be called the centigrade scale because there are 100 gradations between the
ice and steam points of water.)
Thermometers calibrated in this way present problems when extremely accurate readings are needed. For instance, the readings given by an alcohol ther-

mometer calibrated at the ice and steam points of water might agree with those
given by a mercury thermometer only at the calibration points. Because mercury
and alcohol have different thermal expansion properties, when one thermometer
reads a temperature of, for example, 50°C, the other may indicate a slightly different value. The discrepancies between thermometers are especially large when the
temperatures to be measured are far from the calibration points.1
An additional practical problem of any thermometer is the limited range of
temperatures over which it can be used. A mercury thermometer, for example,
cannot be used below the freezing point of mercury, which is ⫺ 39°C, and an alcohol thermometer is not useful for measuring temperatures above 85°C, the boiling
point of alcohol. To surmount this problem, we need a universal thermometer
whose readings are independent of the substance used in it. The gas thermometer,
discussed in the next section, approaches this requirement.

19.3

THE CONSTANT-VOLUME GAS THERMOMETER AND
THE ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE SCALE

The temperature readings given by a gas thermometer are nearly independent of
the substance used in the thermometer. One version is the constant-volume gas
thermometer shown in Figure 19.2. The physical change exploited in this device is
the variation of pressure of a ﬁxed volume of gas with temperature. When the
constant-volume gas thermometer was developed, it was calibrated by using the ice

Two thermometers that use the same liquid may also give different readings. This is due in part to difﬁculties in constructing uniform-bore glass capillary tubes.

and steam points of water, as follows (a different calibration procedure, which we
shall discuss shortly, is now used): The ﬂask was immersed in an ice bath, and mercury reservoir B was raised or lowered until the top of the mercury in column A
was at the zero point on the scale. The height h, the difference between the mercury levels in reservoir B and column A, indicated the pressure in the ﬂask at 0°C.
The ﬂask was then immersed in water at the steam point, and reservoir B was
readjusted until the top of the mercury in column A was again at zero on the scale;
this ensured that the gas’s volume was the same as it was when the ﬂask was in the
ice bath (hence, the designation “constant volume”). This adjustment of reservoir
B gave a value for the gas pressure at 100°C. These two pressure and temperature
values were then plotted, as shown in Figure 19.3. The line connecting the two
points serves as a calibration curve for unknown temperatures. If we wanted to
measure the temperature of a substance, we would place the gas ﬂask in thermal
contact with the substance and adjust the height of reservoir B until the top of the
mercury column in A was at zero on the scale. The height of the mercury column
would indicate the pressure of the gas; knowing the pressure, we could ﬁnd the
temperature of the substance using the graph in Figure 19.3.
Now let us suppose that temperatures are measured with gas thermometers
containing different gases at different initial pressures. Experiments show that the
thermometer readings are nearly independent of the type of gas used, as long as
the gas pressure is low and the temperature is well above the point at which the
gas liqueﬁes (Fig. 19.4). The agreement among thermometers using various gases
improves as the pressure is reduced.
If you extend the curves shown in Figure 19.4 toward negative temperatures,
you ﬁnd, in every case, that the pressure is zero when the temperature is
⫺ 273.15°C. This signiﬁcant temperature is used as the basis for the absolute temperature scale, which sets ⫺ 273.15°C as its zero point. This temperature is often
referred to as absolute zero. The size of a degree on the absolute temperature
scale is identical to the size of a degree on the Celsius scale. Thus, the conversion
between these temperatures is

where TC is the Celsius temperature and T is the absolute temperature.
Because the ice and steam points are experimentally difﬁcult to duplicate, an
absolute temperature scale based on a single ﬁxed point was adopted in 1954 by
the International Committee on Weights and Measures. From a list of ﬁxed points
associated with various substances (Table 19.1), the triple point of water was chosen as the reference temperature for this new scale. The triple point of water is
the single combination of temperature and pressure at which liquid water, gaseous

water, and ice (solid water) coexist in equilibrium. This triple point occurs at a
temperature of approximately 0.01°C and a pressure of 4.58 mm of mercury. On
the new scale, which uses the unit kelvin, the temperature of water at the triple
point was set at 273.16 kelvin, abbreviated 273.16 K. (Note: no degree sign “°” is
used with the unit kelvin.) This choice was made so that the old absolute temperature scale based on the ice and steam points would agree closely with the new scale
based on the triple point. This new absolute temperature scale (also called the
Kelvin scale) employs the SI unit of absolute temperature, the kelvin, which is
deﬁned to be 1/273.16 of the difference between absolute zero and the temperature of the triple point of water.
Figure 19.5 shows the absolute temperature for various physical processes and
structures. The temperature of absolute zero (0 K) cannot be achieved, although laboratory experiments incorporating the laser cooling of atoms have come very close.
What would happen to a gas if its temperature could reach 0 K? As Figure 19.4
indicates, the pressure it exerts on the walls of its container would be zero. In Section 19.5 we shall show that the pressure of a gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its molecules. Thus, according to classical physics, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would become zero at absolute zero, and molecular
motion would cease; hence, the molecules would settle out on the bottom of the
container. Quantum theory modiﬁes this model and shows that some residual energy, called the zero-point energy, would remain at this low temperature.

two scales, a temperature difference of 5°C is equal to a temperature difference
of 5 K. The two scales differ only in the choice of the zero point. Thus, the
ice-point temperature on the Kelvin scale, 273.15 K, corresponds to 0.00°C, and
the Kelvin-scale steam point, 373.15 K, is equivalent to 100.00°C.
A common temperature scale in everyday use in the United States is the
Fahrenheit scale. This scale sets the temperature of the ice point at 32°F and the
temperature of the steam point at 212°F. The relationship between the Celsius and
Fahrenheit temperature scales is

THERMAL EXPANSION OF SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

Our discussion of the liquid thermometer made use of one of the best-known
changes in a substance: As its temperature increases, its volume almost always increases. (As we shall see shortly, in some substances the volume decreases when
the temperature increases.) This phenomenon, known as thermal expansion, has

Figure 19.6 (a) Thermal-expansion joints are used to separate sections of roadways on bridges.
Without these joints, the surfaces would buckle due to thermal expansion on very hot days or
crack due to contraction on very cold days. (b) The long, vertical joint is ﬁlled with a soft material that allows the wall to expand and contract as the temperature of the bricks changes.

an important role in numerous engineering applications. For example, thermalexpansion joints, such as those shown in Figure 19.6, must be included in buildings, concrete highways, railroad tracks, brick walls, and bridges to compensate for
dimensional changes that occur as the temperature changes.
Thermal expansion is a consequence of the change in the average separation
between the constituent atoms in an object. To understand this, imagine that the
atoms are connected by stiff springs, as shown in Figure 19.7. At ordinary temperatures, the atoms in a solid oscillate about their equilibrium positions with an amplitude of approximately 10⫺11 m and a frequency of approximately 1013 Hz. The
average spacing between the atoms is about 10⫺10 m. As the temperature of the
solid increases, the atoms oscillate with greater amplitudes; as a result, the average
separation between them increases.3 Consequently, the object expands.
If thermal expansion is sufﬁciently small relative to an object’s initial dimensions, the change in any dimension is, to a good approximation, proportional to
the ﬁrst power of the temperature change. Suppose that an object has an initial
length Li along some direction at some temperature and that the length increases
by an amount ⌬L for a change in temperature ⌬T. Because it is convenient to consider the fractional change in length per degree of temperature change, we deﬁne
the average coefﬁcient of linear expansion as
⌬L/L i

More precisely, thermal expansion arises from the asymmetrical nature of the potential-energy curve
for the atoms in a solid. If the oscillators were truly harmonic, the average atomic separations would
not change regardless of the amplitude of vibration.

The change in length of an object
is proportional to the change in
temperature

where Lf is the ﬁnal length, Ti and Tf are the initial and ﬁnal temperatures, and
the proportionality constant ␣ is the average coefﬁcient of linear expansion for a
given material and has units of °C⫺1.
It may be helpful to think of thermal expansion as an effective magniﬁcation
or as a photographic enlargement of an object. For example, as a metal washer is
heated (Fig. 19.8), all dimensions, including the radius of the hole, increase according to Equation 19.4.
Table 19.2 lists the average coefﬁcient of linear expansion for various materials. Note that for these materials ␣ is positive, indicating an increase in length with
increasing temperature. This is not always the case. Some substances — calcite
(CaCO3 ) is one example — expand along one dimension (positive ␣) and contract
along another (negative ␣) as their temperatures are increased.
Because the linear dimensions of an object change with temperature, it follows that surface area and volume change as well. The change in volume at constant pressure is proportional to the initial volume Vi and to the change in temperature according to the relationship
⌬V ⫽ ␤Vi ⌬T

(19.6)

where ␤ is the average coefﬁcient of volume expansion. For a solid, the average
coefﬁcient of volume expansion is approximately three times the average linear
expansion coefﬁcient: ␤ ⫽ 3␣. (This assumes that the average coefﬁcient of linear
expansion of the solid is the same in all directions.)
To see that ␤ ⫽ 3␣ for a solid, consider a box of dimensions ᐍ, w, and h. Its
volume at some temperature Ti is Vi ⫽ ᐉwh. If the temperature changes to
Ti ⫹ ⌬T, its volume changes to Vi ⫹ ⌬V, where each dimension changes according

that the change in area of a rectangular plate is given by ⌬A ⫽ 2␣Ai ⌬T (see Problem 53).
As Table 19.2 indicates, each substance has its own characteristic average coefﬁcient of expansion. For example, when the temperatures of a brass rod and a
steel rod of equal length are raised by the same amount from some common initial value, the brass rod expands more than the steel rod does because brass has a
greater average coefﬁcient of expansion than steel does. A simple mechanism
called a bimetallic strip utilizes this principle and is found in practical devices such
as thermostats. It consists of two thin strips of dissimilar metals bonded together.
As the temperature of the strip increases, the two metals expand by different
amounts and the strip bends, as shown in Figure 19.9.

The Unusual Behavior of Water
Liquids generally increase in volume with increasing temperature and have average coefﬁcients of volume expansion about ten times greater than those of solids.
Water is an exception to this rule, as we can see from its density-versus-temperature curve shown in Figure 19.10. As the temperature increases from 0°C to 4°C,
water contracts and thus its density increases. Above 4°C, water expands with increasing temperature, and so its density decreases. In other words, the density of
water reaches a maximum value of 1 000 kg/m3 at 4°C.

How the density of water at atmospheric pressure changes with temperature. The
inset at the right shows that the maximum density of water occurs at 4°C.

We can use this unusual thermal-expansion behavior of water to explain why a
pond begins freezing at the surface rather than at the bottom. When the atmospheric temperature drops from, for example, 7°C to 6°C, the surface water also
cools and consequently decreases in volume. This means that the surface water is
denser than the water below it, which has not cooled and decreased in volume. As
a result, the surface water sinks, and warmer water from below is forced to the surface to be cooled. When the atmospheric temperature is between 4°C and 0°C,
however, the surface water expands as it cools, becoming less dense than the water
below it. The mixing process stops, and eventually the surface water freezes. As the
water freezes, the ice remains on the surface because ice is less dense than water.
The ice continues to build up at the surface, while water near the bottom remains
at 4°C. If this were not the case, then ﬁsh and other forms of marine life would not
survive.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION OF AN IDEAL GAS

In this section we examine the properties of a gas of mass m conﬁned to a container of volume V at a pressure P and a temperature T. It is useful to know how
these quantities are related. In general, the equation that interrelates these quantities, called the equation of state, is very complicated. However, if the gas is maintained at a very low pressure (or low density), the equation of state is quite simple
and can be found experimentally. Such a low-density gas is commonly referred to
as an ideal gas.4
4

To be more speciﬁc, the assumption here is that the temperature of the gas must not be too low (the
gas must not condense into a liquid) or too high, and that the pressure must be low. In reality, an ideal
gas does not exist. However, the concept of an ideal gas is very useful in view of the fact that real gases
at low pressures behave as ideal gases do. The concept of an ideal gas implies that the gas molecules do
not interact except upon collision, and that the molecular volume is negligible compared with the volume of the container.

CHAPTER 19

Temperature

It is convenient to express the amount of gas in a given volume in terms of the
number of moles n. As we learned in Section 1.3, one mole of any substance is that
amount of the substance that contains Avogadro’s number NA ⫽ 6.022 ⫻ 10 23 of
constituent particles (atoms or molecules). The number of moles n of a substance
is related to its mass m through the expression
n⫽

Gas

m
M

(19.7)

where M is the molar mass of the substance (see Section 1.3), which is usually expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). For example, the molar mass of oxygen (O2 ) is 32.0 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of one mole of oxygen is 32.0 g.
Now suppose that an ideal gas is conﬁned to a cylindrical container whose volume can be varied by means of a movable piston, as shown in Figure 19.11. If we
assume that the cylinder does not leak, the mass (or the number of moles) of the
gas remains constant. For such a system, experiments provide the following information: First, when the gas is kept at a constant temperature, its pressure is inversely proportional to its volume (Boyle’s law). Second, when the pressure of the
gas is kept constant, its volume is directly proportional to its temperature (the law
of Charles and Gay – Lussac). These observations are summarized by the equation
of state for an ideal gas:

can be varied by means of a movable piston.

The universal gas constant

PV ⫽ nRT

(19.8)

In this expression, known as the ideal gas law, R is a universal constant that is the
same for all gases and T is the absolute temperature in kelvins. Experiments on
numerous gases show that as the pressure approaches zero, the quantity PV/nT approaches the same value R for all gases. For this reason, R is called the universal
gas constant. In SI units, in which pressure is expressed in pascals (1 Pa ⫽
1 N/m2) and volume in cubic meters, the product PV has units of newton⭈ meters,
or joules, and R has the value
R ⫽ 8.315 J/mol⭈K

(19.9)

If the pressure is expressed in atmospheres and the volume in liters (1 L ⫽
103 cm3 ⫽ 10⫺3 m3 ), then R has the value
R ⫽ 0.082 14 L⭈atm/mol⭈K

QuickLab
Vigorously shake a can of soda pop
and then thoroughly tap its bottom
and sides to dislodge any bubbles
trapped there. You should be able to
open the can without spraying its
contents all over.

Using this value of R and Equation 19.8, we ﬁnd that the volume occupied by
1 mol of any gas at atmospheric pressure and at 0°C (273 K) is 22.4 L.
Now that we have presented the equation of state, we are ready for a formal
deﬁnition of an ideal gas: An ideal gas is one for which PV/nT is constant at
all pressures.
The ideal gas law states that if the volume and temperature of a ﬁxed amount
of gas do not change, then the pressure also remains constant. Consider the bottle
of champagne shown at the beginning of this chapter. Because the temperature of
the bottle and its contents remains constant, so does the pressure, as can be shown
by replacing the cork with a pressure gauge. Shaking the bottle displaces some carbon dioxide gas from the “head space” to form bubbles within the liquid, and
these bubbles become attached to the inside of the bottle. (No new gas is generated by shaking.) When the bottle is opened, the pressure is reduced; this causes
the volume of the bubbles to increase suddenly. If the bubbles are attached to the
bottle (beneath the liquid surface), their rapid expansion expels liquid from the

593

19.5 Macroscopic Description of an Ideal Gas

bottle. If the sides and bottom of the bottle are ﬁrst tapped until no bubbles remain beneath the surface, then when the champagne is opened, the drop in pressure will not force liquid from the bottle. Try the QuickLab, but practice before
demonstrating to a friend!
The ideal gas law is often expressed in terms of the total number of molecules
N. Because the total number of molecules equals the product of the number of
moles n and Avogadro’s number NA , we can write Equation 19.8 as
PV ⫽ nRT ⫽

N

It is common to call quantities such as P, V, and T the thermodynamic variables of an ideal gas. If the equation of state is known, then one of the variables
can always be expressed as some function of the other two.

Filling a Scuba Tank

A certain scuba tank is designed to hold 66 ft3 of air when it
is at atmospheric pressure at 22°C. When this volume of air is
compressed to an absolute pressure of 3 000 lb/in.2 and
stored in a 10-L (0.35-ft3 ) tank, the air becomes so hot that
the tank must be allowed to cool before it can be used. If the
air does not cool, what is its temperature? (Assume that the
air behaves like an ideal gas.)

The initial pressure of the air is 14.7 lb/in.2, its ﬁnal pressure
is 3 000 lb/in.2, and the air is compressed from an initial volume of 66 ft3 to a ﬁnal volume of 0.35 ft3. The initial temperature, converted to SI units, is 295 K. Solving for Tf , we obtain

In the previous example we used SI units for the temperature in our calculation step but
not for the pressures or volumes. When working with the ideal gas law, how do you decide
when it is necessary to use SI units and when it is not?

A spray can containing a propellant gas at twice atmospheric

SUMMARY
Two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with each other if they have the same
temperature.
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if objects A and B are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third object C, then objects A and B are in
thermal equilibrium with each other.
The SI unit of absolute temperature is the kelvin, which is deﬁned to be the
fraction 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water.
When the temperature of an object is changed by an amount ⌬T, its length
changes by an amount ⌬L that is proportional to ⌬T and to its initial length
Li :
⌬L ⫽ ␣L i ⌬T

(19.4)

where the constant ␣ is the average coefﬁcient of linear expansion. The
average volume expansion coefﬁcient ␤ for a solid is approximately equal
to 3␣.
An ideal gas is one for which PV/nT is constant at all pressures. An ideal gas
is described by the equation of state,
PV ⫽ nRT

(19.8)

where n equals the number of moles of the gas, V is its volume, R is the universal
gas constant (8.315 J/mol⭈ K), and T is the absolute temperature. A real gas behaves approximately as an ideal gas if it is far from liquefaction.

19.1 The size of a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is 59 the size
of a degree on the Celsius scale. This is true because the
Fahrenheit range of 32°F to 212°F is equivalent to the
Celsius range of 0°C to 100°C. The factor 95 in Equation
19.2 corrects for this difference. Equation 19.1 does not
need this correction because the size of a Celsius degree
is the same as the size of a kelvin.
19.2 The glass bulb containing most of the mercury warms
up ﬁrst because it is in direct thermal contact with the
hot water. It expands slightly, and thus its volume increases. This causes the mercury level in the capillary
tube to drop. As the mercury inside the bulb warms
up, it also expands. Eventually, its increase in volume

is sufﬁcient to raise the mercury level in the capillary
tube.
19.3 For the glass, choose Pyrex, which has a lower average
coefﬁcient of linear expansion than does ordinary glass.
For the working liquid, choose gasoline, which has the
largest average coefﬁcient of volume expansion.
19.4 You do not have to convert the units for pressure and
volume to SI units as long as the same units appear in
the numerator and the denominator. This is not true for
ratios of temperature units, as you can see by comparing
the ratios 300 K/200 K and 26.85°C/(⫺ 73.15°C). You
must always use absolute (kelvin) temperatures when applying the ideal gas law.

20.1 Heat and Internal Energy

U

ntil about 1850, the ﬁelds of thermodynamics and mechanics were considered two distinct branches of science, and the law of conservation of energy
seemed to describe only certain kinds of mechanical systems. However,
mid – 19th century experiments performed by the Englishman James Joule and others showed that energy may be added to (or removed from) a system either by heat
or by doing work on the system (or having the system do work). Today we know
that internal energy, which we formally deﬁne in this chapter, can be transformed to
mechanical energy. Once the concept of energy was broadened to include internal
energy, the law of conservation of energy emerged as a universal law of nature.
This chapter focuses on the concept of internal energy, the processes by which
energy is transferred, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, and some of the important
applications of the ﬁrst law. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy. It describes systems in which the only energy change is that of internal energy, which is due to transfers of energy by heat or work. Furthermore, the
ﬁrst law makes no distinction between the results of heat and the results of work.
According to the ﬁrst law, a system’s internal energy can be changed either by an
energy transfer by heat to or from the system or by work done on or by the system.

20.1
10.3

HEAT AND INTERNAL ENERGY

At the outset, it is important that we make a major distinction between internal energy and heat. Internal energy is all the energy of a system that is associated
with its microscopic components — atoms and molecules — when viewed
from a reference frame at rest with respect to the object. The last part of this
sentence ensures that any bulk kinetic energy of the system due to its motion
through space is not included in internal energy. Internal energy includes kinetic
energy of translation, rotation, and vibration of molecules, potential energy within
molecules, and potential energy between molecules. It is useful to relate internal
energy to the temperature of an object, but this relationship is limited — we shall
ﬁnd in Section 20.3 that internal energy changes can also occur in the absence of
temperature changes.
As we shall see in Chapter 21, the internal energy of a monatomic ideal gas is
associated with the translational motion of its atoms. This is the only type of energy available for the microscopic components of this system. In this special case,
the internal energy is simply the total kinetic energy of the atoms of the gas; the
higher the temperature of the gas, the greater the average kinetic energy of the
atoms and the greater the internal energy of the gas. More generally, in solids, liquids, and molecular gases, internal energy includes other forms of molecular energy. For example, a diatomic molecule can have rotational kinetic energy, as well
as vibrational kinetic and potential energy.
Heat is deﬁned as the transfer of energy across the boundary of a system due to a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. When you heat a substance, you are transferring energy into it by placing it in
contact with surroundings that have a higher temperature. This is the case, for example, when you place a pan of cold water on a stove burner — the burner is at a
higher temperature than the water, and so the water gains energy. We shall also
use the term heat to represent the amount of energy transferred by this method.
Scientists used to think of heat as a ﬂuid called caloric, which they believed was
transferred between objects; thus, they deﬁned heat in terms of the temperature
changes produced in an object during heating. Today we recognize the distinct
difference between internal energy and heat. Nevertheless, we refer to quantities

James Prescott Joule

British
physicist (1818 – 1889) Joule received some formal education in
mathematics, philosophy, and chemistry but was in large part selfeducated. His research led to the
establishment of the principle of
conservation of energy. His study of
the quantitative relationship among
electrical, mechanical, and chemical
effects of heat culminated in his discovery in 1843 of the amount of work
required to produce a unit of energy,
called the mechanical equivalent of
heat. (By kind permission of the President and Council of the Royal Society)

using names that do not quite correctly deﬁne the quantities but which have become entrenched in physics tradition based on these early ideas. Examples of such
quantities are latent heat and heat capacity.
As an analogy to the distinction between heat and internal energy, consider
the distinction between work and mechanical energy discussed in Chapter 7.
The work done on a system is a measure of the amount of energy transferred to
the system from its surroundings, whereas the mechanical energy of the system
(kinetic or potential, or both) is a consequence of the motion and relative positions of the members of the system. Thus, when a person does work on a system,
energy is transferred from the person to the system. It makes no sense to talk
about the work of a system — one can refer only to the work done on or by a system when some process has occurred in which energy has been transferred to or
from the system. Likewise, it makes no sense to talk about the heat of a system —
one can refer to heat only when energy has been transferred as a result of a temperature difference. Both heat and work are ways of changing the energy of a
system.
It is also important to recognize that the internal energy of a system can be
changed even when no energy is transferred by heat. For example, when a gas is
compressed by a piston, the gas is warmed and its internal energy increases, but no
transfer of energy by heat from the surroundings to the gas has occurred. If the
gas then expands rapidly, it cools and its internal energy decreases, but no transfer
of energy by heat from it to the surroundings has taken place. The temperature
changes in the gas are due not to a difference in temperature between the gas and
its surroundings but rather to the compression and the expansion. In each case,
energy is transferred to or from the gas by work, and the energy change within the
system is an increase or decrease of internal energy. The changes in internal energy in these examples are evidenced by corresponding changes in the temperature of the gas.

Units of Heat

The calorie

As we have mentioned, early studies of heat focused on the resultant increase in
temperature of a substance, which was often water. The early notions of heat based
on caloric suggested that the ﬂow of this ﬂuid from one body to another caused
changes in temperature. From the name of this mythical ﬂuid, we have an energy
unit related to thermal processes, the calorie (cal), which is deﬁned as the
amount of energy transfer necessary to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C.1 (Note that the “Calorie,” written with a capital “C”
and used in describing the energy content of foods, is actually a kilocalorie.) The
unit of energy in the British system is the British thermal unit (Btu), which is deﬁned as the amount of energy transfer required to raise the temperature of
1 lb of water from 63°F to 64°F.
Scientists are increasingly using the SI unit of energy, the joule, when describing thermal processes. In this textbook, heat and internal energy are usually measured in joules. (Note that both heat and work are measured in energy units. Do
not confuse these two means of energy transfer with energy itself, which is also measured in joules.)
1

Originally, the calorie was deﬁned as the “heat” necessary to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by
1°C. However, careful measurements showed that the amount of energy required to produce a 1°C
change depends somewhat on the initial temperature; hence, a more precise deﬁnition evolved.

20.1 Heat and Internal Energy

The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
In Chapters 7 and 8, we found that whenever friction is present in a mechanical
system, some mechanical energy is lost — in other words, mechanical energy is not
conserved in the presence of nonconservative forces. Various experiments show
that this lost mechanical energy does not simply disappear but is transformed into
internal energy. We can perform such an experiment at home by simply hammering a nail into a scrap piece of wood. What happens to all the kinetic energy of the
hammer once we have ﬁnished? Some of it is now in the nail as internal energy, as
demonstrated by the fact that the nail is measurably warmer. Although this connection between mechanical and internal energy was ﬁrst suggested by Benjamin
Thompson, it was Joule who established the equivalence of these two forms of
energy.
A schematic diagram of Joule’s most famous experiment is shown in Figure
20.1. The system of interest is the water in a thermally insulated container. Work is
done on the water by a rotating paddle wheel, which is driven by heavy blocks
falling at a constant speed. The stirred water is warmed due to the friction between
it and the paddles. If the energy lost in the bearings and through the walls is neglected, then the loss in potential energy associated with the blocks equals the work
done by the paddle wheel on the water. If the two blocks fall through a distance h,
the loss in potential energy is 2mgh, where m is the mass of one block; it is this energy that causes the temperature of the water to increase. By varying the conditions
of the experiment, Joule found that the loss in mechanical energy 2mgh is proportional to the increase in water temperature ⌬T. The proportionality constant was
found to be approximately 4.18 J/g ⭈ °C. Hence, 4.18 J of mechanical energy raises
the temperature of 1 g of water by 1°C. More precise measurements taken later
demonstrated the proportionality to be 4.186 J/g ⭈ °C when the temperature of the
water was raised from 14.5°C to 15.5°C. We adopt this “15-degree calorie” value:
1 cal ⬅ 4.186 J

(20.1)

This equality is known, for purely historical reasons, as the mechanical equivalent of heat.

HEAT CAPACITY AND SPECIFIC HEAT

When energy is added to a substance and no work is done, the temperature of the
substance usually rises. (An exception to this statement is the case in which a substance undergoes a change of state — also called a phase transition — as discussed in
the next section.) The quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of a
given mass of a substance by some amount varies from one substance to another.
For example, the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of
water by 1°C is 4 186 J, but the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of copper by 1°C is only 387 J. In the discussion that follows, we shall
use heat as our example of energy transfer, but we shall keep in mind that we
could change the temperature of our system by doing work on it.
The heat capacity C of a particular sample of a substance is deﬁned as the
amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of that sample by 1°C. From
this deﬁnition, we see that if heat Q produces a change ⌬T in the temperature of a
substance, then
Q ⫽ C⌬T

(20.2)

The speciﬁc heat c of a substance is the heat capacity per unit mass. Thus, if
energy Q transferred by heat to mass m of a substance changes the temperature of
the sample by ⌬T, then the speciﬁc heat of the substance is
Speciﬁc heat

c⬅

Q
m⌬T

(20.3)

Speciﬁc heat is essentially a measure of how thermally insensitive a substance is to
the addition of energy. The greater a material’s speciﬁc heat, the more energy
must be added to a given mass of the material to cause a particular temperature
change. Table 20.1 lists representative speciﬁc heats.
From this deﬁnition, we can express the energy Q transferred by heat between
a sample of mass m of a material and its surroundings for a temperature change
⌬T as
Q ⫽ mc⌬T

(20.4)

For example, the energy required to raise the temperature of 0.500 kg of water by
3.00°C is (0.500 kg)(4 186 J/kg ⭈ °C)(3.00°C) ⫽ 6.28 ⫻ 103 J. Note that when the
temperature increases, Q and ⌬T are taken to be positive, and energy ﬂows into

ﬂows out of the system.
Speciﬁc heat varies with temperature. However, if temperature intervals are
not too great, the temperature variation can be ignored and c can be treated as a
constant.2 For example, the speciﬁc heat of water varies by only about 1% from
0°C to 100°C at atmospheric pressure. Unless stated otherwise, we shall neglect
such variations.
Measured values of speciﬁc heats are found to depend on the conditions of
the experiment. In general, measurements made at constant pressure are different
from those made at constant volume. For solids and liquids, the difference between the two values is usually no greater than a few percent and is often neglected. Most of the values given in Table 20.1 were measured at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. As we shall see in Chapter 21, the speciﬁc heats for

In an open area, such as a parking
lot, use the ﬂame from a match to
pop an air-ﬁlled balloon. Now try the
same thing with a water-ﬁlled balloon. Why doesn’t the water-ﬁlled balloon pop?

It is interesting to note from Table 20.1 that water has the highest speciﬁc heat
of common materials. This high speciﬁc heat is responsible, in part, for the moderate temperatures found near large bodies of water. As the temperature of a body
of water decreases during the winter, energy is transferred from the cooling water
to the air by heat, increasing the internal energy of the air. Because of the high
speciﬁc heat of water, a relatively large amount of energy is transferred to the air
for even modest temperature changes of the water. The air carries this internal energy landward when prevailing winds are favorable. For example, the prevailing
winds on the West Coast of the United States are toward the land (eastward).
Hence, the energy liberated by the Paciﬁc Ocean as it cools keeps coastal areas
much warmer than they would otherwise be. This explains why the western coastal
states generally have more favorable winter weather than the eastern coastal states,
where the prevailing winds do not tend to carry the energy toward land.
A difference in speciﬁc heats causes the cheese topping on a slice of pizza to
burn you more than a mouthful of crust at the same temperature. Both crust and
cheese undergo the same change in temperature, starting at a high straight-fromthe-oven value and ending at the temperature of the inside of your mouth, which is
about 37°C. Because the cheese is much more likely to burn you, it must release
much more energy as it cools than does the crust. If we assume roughly the same
mass for both cheese and crust, then Equation 20.3 indicates that the speciﬁc heat of
the cheese, which is mostly water, is greater than that of the crust, which is mostly air.

Conservation of Energy: Calorimetry
One technique for measuring speciﬁc heat involves heating a sample to some
known temperature Tx , placing it in a vessel containing water of known mass and
temperature Tw ⬍ Tx , and measuring the temperature of the water after equilibrium has been reached. Because a negligible amount of mechanical work is done
in the process, the law of the conservation of energy requires that the amount of
energy that leaves the sample (of unknown speciﬁc heat) equal the amount of energy that enters the water.3 This technique is called calorimetry, and devices in
which this energy transfer occurs are called calorimeters.
Conservation of energy allows us to write the equation
Q cold ⫽ ⫺Q hot

(20.5)

which simply states that the energy leaving the hot part of the system by heat is
equal to that entering the cold part of the system. The negative sign in the equation is necessary to maintain consistency with our sign convention for heat. The

For precise measurements, the water container should be included in our calculations because it also
exchanges energy with the sample. However, doing so would require a knowledge of its mass and composition. If the mass of the water is much greater than that of the container, we can neglect the effects
of the container.

20.2 Heat Capacity and Specific Heat

heat Q hot is negative because energy is leaving the hot sample. The negative sign
in the equation ensures that the right-hand side is positive and thus consistent with
the left-hand side, which is positive because energy is entering the cold water.
Suppose m x is the mass of a sample of some substance whose speciﬁc heat we
wish to determine. Let us call its speciﬁc heat c x and its initial temperature Tx .
Likewise, let m w , c w , and Tw represent corresponding values for the water. If Tf is
the ﬁnal equilibrium temperature after everything is mixed, then from Equation
20.4, we ﬁnd that the energy transfer for the water is m wc w(Tf ⫺ Tw), which is positive because Tf ⬎ Tw , and that the energy transfer for the sample of unknown speciﬁc heat is m xc x(Tf ⫺ Tx), which is negative. Substituting these expressions into
Equation 20.5 gives
m wc w(Tf ⫺ Tw) ⫽ ⫺m xc x(Tf ⫺ Tx)
Solving for cx gives

bullet?

Solution

The ingot is most likely iron, as we can see by comparing
this result with the data given in Table 20.1. Note that the
temperature of the ingot is initially above the steam point.
Thus, some of the water may vaporize when we drop the ingot into the water. We assume that we have a sealed system
and thus that this steam cannot escape. Because the ﬁnal
equilibrium temperature is lower than the steam point, any
steam that does result recondenses back into water.

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

LATENT HEAT

A substance often undergoes a change in temperature when energy is transferred
between it and its surroundings. There are situations, however, in which the transfer of energy does not result in a change in temperature. This is the case whenever
the physical characteristics of the substance change from one form to another;
such a change is commonly referred to as a phase change. Two common phase
changes are from solid to liquid (melting) and from liquid to gas (boiling); another is a change in the crystalline structure of a solid. All such phase changes involve a change in internal energy but no change in temperature. The increase in
internal energy in boiling, for example, is represented by the breaking of bonds
between molecules in the liquid state; this bond breaking allows the molecules to
move farther apart in the gaseous state, with a corresponding increase in intermolecular potential energy.
As you might expect, different substances respond differently to the addition
or removal of energy as they change phase because their internal molecular
arrangements vary. Also, the amount of energy transferred during a phase change
depends on the amount of substance involved. (It takes less energy to melt an ice
cube than it does to thaw a frozen lake.) If a quantity Q of energy transfer is required to change the phase of a mass m of a substance, the ratio L ⬅ Q /m characterizes an important thermal property of that substance. Because this added or removed energy does not result in a temperature change, the quantity L is called the
latent heat (literally, the “hidden” heat) of the substance. The value of L for a
substance depends on the nature of the phase change, as well as on the properties
of the substance.
From the deﬁnition of latent heat, and again choosing heat as our energy
transfer mechanism, we ﬁnd that the energy required to change the phase of a
given mass m of a pure substance is
Q ⫽ mL

Latent heat of fusion Lf is the term used when the phase change is from solid to

Quick Quiz 20.2
Which is more likely to cause a serious burn, 100°C liquid water or an equal mass of 100°C
steam?

To understand the role of latent heat in phase changes, consider the energy
required to convert a 1.00-g block of ice at ⫺ 30.0°C to steam at 120.0°C. Figure
20.2 indicates the experimental results obtained when energy is gradually added to
the ice. Let us examine each portion of the red curve.
Part A. On this portion of the curve, the temperature of the ice changes from
⫺ 30.0°C to 0.0°C. Because the speciﬁc heat of ice is 2 090 J/kg ⭈ °C, we can calculate the amount of energy added by using Equation 20.4:
Q ⫽ m ic i ⌬T ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(2 090 J/kg⭈⬚C)(30.0⬚C) ⫽ 62.7 J
Part B. When the temperature of the ice reaches 0.0°C, the ice – water mixture
remains at this temperature — even though energy is being added — until all the ice
melts. The energy required to melt 1.00 g of ice at 0.0°C is, from Equation 20.6,
Q ⫽ mL f ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(3.33 ⫻ 10 5 J/kg) ⫽ 333 J

When a gas cools, it eventually condenses — that is, it returns to the liquid phase. The energy given up
per unit mass is called the latent heat of condensation and is numerically equal to the latent heat of vaporization. Likewise, when a liquid cools, it eventually solidiﬁes, and the latent heat of solidiﬁcation is numerically equal to the latent heat of fusion.

CHAPTER 20

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

Part C. Between 0.0°C and 100.0°C, nothing surprising happens. No phase
change occurs, and so all energy added to the water is used to increase its temperature. The amount of energy necessary to increase the temperature from 0.0°C to
100.0°C is
Q ⫽ m wc w ⌬T ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(4.19 ⫻ 10 3 J/kg⭈⬚C)(100.0⬚C) ⫽ 419 J
Part D. At 100.0°C, another phase change occurs as the water changes from water at 100.0°C to steam at 100.0°C. Similar to the ice – water mixture in part B, the
water – steam mixture remains at 100.0°C — even though energy is being added —
until all of the liquid has been converted to steam. The energy required to convert
1.00 g of water to steam at 100.0°C is
Q ⫽ mL v ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(2.26 ⫻ 10 6 J/kg) ⫽ 2.26 ⫻ 10 3 J
Part E. On this portion of the curve, as in parts A and C, no phase change occurs; thus, all energy added is used to increase the temperature of the steam. The
energy that must be added to raise the temperature of the steam from 100.0°C to
120.0°C is
Q ⫽ m sc s ⌬T ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(2.01 ⫻ 10 3 J/kg⭈⬚C)(20.0⬚C) ⫽ 40.2 J
The total amount of energy that must be added to change 1 g of ice at ⫺ 30.0°C to
steam at 120.0°C is the sum of the results from all ﬁve parts of the curve, which is
3.11 ⫻ 103 J. Conversely, to cool 1 g of steam at 120.0°C to ice at ⫺ 30.0°C, we
must remove 3.11 ⫻ 103 J of energy.
We can describe phase changes in terms of a rearrangement of molecules
when energy is added to or removed from a substance. (For elemental substances
in which the atoms do not combine to form molecules, the following discussion
should be interpreted in terms of atoms. We use the general term molecules to refer
to both molecular substances and elemental substances.) Consider ﬁrst the liquidto-gas phase change. The molecules in a liquid are close together, and the forces
between them are stronger than those between the more widely separated molecules of a gas. Therefore, work must be done on the liquid against these attractive
molecular forces if the molecules are to separate. The latent heat of vaporization is
the amount of energy per unit mass that must be added to the liquid to accomplish this separation.
Similarly, for a solid, we imagine that the addition of energy causes the amplitude of vibration of the molecules about their equilibrium positions to become
greater as the temperature increases. At the melting point of the solid, the amplitude is great enough to break the bonds between molecules and to allow molecules to move to new positions. The molecules in the liquid also are bound to each
other, but less strongly than those in the solid phase. The latent heat of fusion is
equal to the energy required per unit mass to transform the bonds among all molecules from the solid-type bond to the liquid-type bond.
As you can see from Table 20.2, the latent heat of vaporization for a given substance is usually somewhat higher than the latent heat of fusion. This is not surprising if we consider that the average distance between molecules in the gas
phase is much greater than that in either the liquid or the solid phase. In the
solid-to-liquid phase change, we transform solid-type bonds between molecules
into liquid-type bonds between molecules, which are only slightly less strong. In
the liquid-to-gas phase change, however, we break liquid-type bonds and create a
situation in which the molecules of the gas essentially are not bonded to each

other. Therefore, it is not surprising that more energy is required to vaporize a
given mass of substance than is required to melt it.

Problem-Solving Hints
Calorimetry Problems
If you are having difﬁculty in solving calorimetry problems, be sure to consider the following points:
• Units of measure must be consistent. For instance, if you are using speciﬁc
heats measured in cal/g ⭈ °C, be sure that masses are in grams and temperatures are in Celsius degrees.
• Transfers of energy are given by the equation Q ⫽ mc ⌬T only for those
processes in which no phase changes occur. Use the equations Q ⫽ mL f and
Q ⫽ mL v only when phase changes are taking place.
• Often, errors in sign are made when the equation Q cold ⫽ ⫺Q hot is used.
Make sure that you use the negative sign in the equation, and remember
that ⌬T is always the ﬁnal temperature minus the initial temperature.

EXAMPLE 20.4

Cooling the Steam

What mass of steam initially at 130°C is needed to warm 200 g
of water in a 100-g glass container from 20.0°C to 50.0°C?

Solution

The steam loses energy in three stages. In the
ﬁrst stage, the steam is cooled to 100°C. The energy transfer
in the process is
Q 1 ⫽ m sc s ⌬T ⫽ m s(2.01 ⫻ 10 3 J/kg⭈⬚C)(⫺30.0⬚C)
⫽ ⫺m s(6.03 ⫻ 10 4 J/kg)
where ms is the unknown mass of the steam.
In the second stage, the steam is converted to water. To
ﬁnd the energy transfer during this phase change, we use
Q ⫽ ⫺mL v , where the negative sign indicates that energy is
leaving the steam:
Q 2 ⫽ ⫺m s(2.26 ⫻ 10 6 J/kg)
In the third stage, the temperature of the water created
from the steam is reduced to 50.0°C. This change requires an
energy transfer of
Q 3 ⫽ m sc w ⌬T ⫽ m s(4.19 ⫻ 10 3 J/kg⭈⬚C)(⫺50.0⬚C)
⫽ ⫺m s(2.09 ⫻ 10 5 J/kg)

Adding the energy transfers in these three stages, we obtain
Q hot ⫽ Q 1 ⫹ Q 2 ⫹ Q 3
⫽ ⫺m s(6.03 ⫻ 10 4 J/kg ⫹ 2.26 ⫻ 10 6 J/kg
⫹ 2.09 ⫻ 10 5 J/kg)
⫽ ⫺m s(2.53 ⫻ 10 6 J/kg)
Now, we turn our attention to the temperature increase of
the water and the glass. Using Equation 20.4, we ﬁnd that
Q cold ⫽ (0.200 kg)(4.19 ⫻ 10 3 J/kg⭈⬚C)(30.0⬚C)
⫹(0.100 kg)(837 J/kg⭈⬚C)(30.0⬚C)
⫽ 2.77 ⫻ 10 4 J

In the macroscopic approach to thermodynamics, we describe the state of a system
using such variables as pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy. The
number of macroscopic variables needed to characterize a system depends on the
nature of the system. For a homogeneous system, such as a gas containing only
one type of molecule, usually only two variables are needed. However, it is important to note that a macroscopic state of an isolated system can be speciﬁed only if the
system is in thermal equilibrium internally. In the case of a gas in a container, internal thermal equilibrium requires that every part of the gas be at the same pressure and temperature.
Consider a gas contained in a cylinder ﬁtted with a movable piston (Fig. 20.3).
At equilibrium, the gas occupies a volume V and exerts a uniform pressure P on
the cylinder’s walls and on the piston. If the piston has a cross-sectional area A, the

force exerted by the gas on the piston is F ⫽ PA. Now let us assume that the gas expands quasi-statically, that is, slowly enough to allow the system to remain essentially in thermal equilibrium at all times. As the piston moves up a distance dy, the
work done by the gas on the piston is

Because A dy is the increase in volume of the gas dV, we can express the work done
by the gas as
dW ⫽ P dV

(20.7)

Because the gas expands, dV is positive, and so the work done by the gas is positive.
If the gas were compressed, dV would be negative, indicating that the work done
by the gas (which can be interpreted as work done on the gas) was negative.
In the thermodynamics problems that we shall solve, we shall identify the system of interest as a substance that is exchanging energy with the environment. In
many problems, this will be a gas contained in a vessel; however, we will also consider problems involving liquids and solids. It is an unfortunate fact that, because
of the separate historical development of thermodynamics and mechanics, positive
work for a thermodynamic system is commonly deﬁned as the work done by the
system, rather than that done on the system. This is the reverse of the case for our
study of work in mechanics. Thus, in thermodynamics, positive work represents a transfer of energy out of the system. We will use this convention to be
consistent with common treatments of thermodynamics.
The total work done by the gas as its volume changes from Vi to Vf is given by
the integral of Equation 20.7:

To evaluate this integral, it is not enough that we know only the initial and ﬁnal
values of the pressure. We must also know the pressure at every instant during the
expansion; we would know this if we had a functional dependence of P with respect to V. This important point is true for any process — the expansion we are discussing here, or any other. To fully specify a process, we must know the values of
the thermodynamic variables at every state through which the system passes between the initial and ﬁnal states. In the expansion we are considering here, we can
plot the pressure and volume at each instant to create a PV diagram like the one
shown in Figure 20.4. The value of the integral in Equation 20.8 is the area
bounded by such a curve. Thus, we can say that
the work done by a gas in the expansion from an initial state to a ﬁnal state is
the area under the curve connecting the states in a PV diagram.
As Figure 20.4 shows, the work done in the expansion from the initial state i to
the ﬁnal state f depends on the path taken between these two states, where the
path on a PV diagram is a description of the thermodynamic process through
which the system is taken. To illustrate this important point, consider several paths
connecting i and f (Fig. 20.5). In the process depicted in Figure 20.5a, the pressure of the gas is ﬁrst reduced from Pi to Pf by cooling at constant volume Vi . The
gas then expands from Vi to Vf at constant pressure Pf . The value of the work done
along this path is equal to the area of the shaded rectangle, which is equal to

Work equals area under the curve

Pf (Vf ⫺ Vi ). In Figure 20.5b, the gas ﬁrst expands from Vi to Vf at constant pressure
Pi . Then, its pressure is reduced to Pf at constant volume Vf . The value of the work
done along this path is Pi(Vf ⫺ Vi ), which is greater than that for the process described in Figure 20.5a. Finally, for the process described in Figure 20.5c, where
both P and V change continuously, the work done has some value intermediate between the values obtained in the ﬁrst two processes. Therefore, we see that the
work done by a system depends on the initial and ﬁnal states and on the
path followed by the system between these states.
The energy transfer by heat Q into or out of a system also depends on the
process. Consider the situations depicted in Figure 20.6. In each case, the gas has
the same initial volume, temperature, and pressure and is assumed to be ideal. In
Figure 20.6a, the gas is thermally insulated from its surroundings except at the bottom of the gas-ﬁlled region, where it is in thermal contact with an energy reservoir.
An energy reservoir is a source of energy that is considered to be so great that a ﬁnite
transfer of energy from the reservoir does not change its temperature. The piston
is held at its initial position by an external agent — a hand, for instance. When the
force with which the piston is held is reduced slightly, the piston rises very slowly to
its ﬁnal position. Because the piston is moving upward, the gas is doing work on

the piston. During this expansion to the ﬁnal volume Vf , just enough energy is transferred by heat from the reservoir to the gas to maintain a constant temperature Ti .
Now consider the completely thermally insulated system shown in Figure
20.6b. When the membrane is broken, the gas expands rapidly into the vacuum
until it occupies a volume Vf and is at a pressure Pf . In this case, the gas does no
work because there is no movable piston on which the gas applies a force. Furthermore, no energy is transferred by heat through the insulating wall.
The initial and ﬁnal states of the ideal gas in Figure 20.6a are identical to the
initial and ﬁnal states in Figure 20.6b, but the paths are different. In the ﬁrst case,
the gas does work on the piston, and energy is transferred slowly to the gas. In the
second case, no energy is transferred, and the value of the work done is zero.
Therefore, we conclude that energy transfer by heat, like work done, depends
on the initial, ﬁnal, and intermediate states of the system. In other words, because heat and work depend on the path, neither quantity is determined solely by
the end points of a thermodynamic process.

20.5
10.6

THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

When we introduced the law of conservation of mechanical energy in Chapter 8,
we stated that the mechanical energy of a system is constant in the absence of nonconservative forces such as friction. That is, we did not include changes in the internal energy of the system in this mechanical model. The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
is a generalization of the law of conservation of energy that encompasses changes in
internal energy. It is a universally valid law that can be applied to many processes
and provides a connection between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.
We have discussed two ways in which energy can be transferred between a system and its surroundings. One is work done by the system, which requires that there
be a macroscopic displacement of the point of application of a force (or pressure).
The other is heat, which occurs through random collisions between the molecules
of the system. Both mechanisms result in a change in the internal energy of the system and therefore usually result in measurable changes in the macroscopic variables
of the system, such as the pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas.
To better understand these ideas on a quantitative basis, suppose that a system
undergoes a change from an initial state to a ﬁnal state. During this change, energy transfer by heat Q to the system occurs, and work W is done by the system. As
an example, suppose that the system is a gas in which the pressure and volume
change from Pi and Vi to Pf and Vf . If the quantity Q ⫺ W is measured for various
paths connecting the initial and ﬁnal equilibrium states, we ﬁnd that it is the same
for all paths connecting the two states. We conclude that the quantity Q ⫺ W is determined completely by the initial and ﬁnal states of the system, and we call this
quantity the change in the internal energy of the system. Although Q and W
both depend on the path, the quantity Q ⴚ W is independent of the path. If we
use the sumbol E int to represent the internal energy, then the change in internal
energy ⌬E int can be expressed as5
⌬E int ⫽ Q ⫺ W

(20.9)

5 It is an unfortunate accident of history that the traditional symbol for internal energy is U, which is
also the traditional symbol for potential energy, as introduced in Chapter 8. To avoid confusion between potential energy and internal energy, we use the symbol E int for internal energy in this book. If
you take an advanced course in thermodynamics, however, be prepared to see U used as the symbol for
internal energy.

This device, called Hero’s engine, was
invented around 150 B.C. by Hero
in Alexandria. When water is
boiled in the ﬂask, which is suspended by a cord, steam exits
through two tubes at the sides (in
opposite directions), creating a
torque that rotates the ﬂask.

Q ⫺ W is the change in internal
energy

First-law equation

618

CHAPTER 20

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

where all quantities must have the same units of measure for energy.6 Equation 20.9
is known as the ﬁrst-law equation and is a key concept in many applications. As a
reminder, we use the convention that Q is positive when energy enters the system
and negative when energy leaves the system, and that W is positive when the system
does work on the surroundings and negative when work is done on the system.
When a system undergoes an inﬁnitesimal change in state in which a small
amount of energy dQ is transferred by heat and a small amount of work dW is
done, the internal energy changes by a small amount dE int . Thus, for inﬁnitesimal
processes we can express the ﬁrst-law equation as7
First-law equation for inﬁnitesimal
changes

Isolated system

dE int ⫽ dQ ⫺ dW
The ﬁrst-law equation is an energy conservation equation specifying that the
only type of energy that changes in the system is the internal energy E int . Let us
look at some special cases in which this condition exists.
First, let us consider an isolated system — that is, one that does not interact with
its surroundings. In this case, no energy transfer by heat takes place and the
value of the work done by the system is zero; hence, the internal energy remains
constant. That is, because Q ⫽ W ⫽ 0, it follows that ⌬E int ⫽ 0, and thus
E int , i ⫽ E int , f . We conclude that the internal energy Eint of an isolated system
remains constant.
Next, we consider the case of a system (one not isolated from its surroundings) that is taken through a cyclic process — that is, a process that starts and
ends at the same state. In this case, the change in the internal energy must again
be zero, and therefore the energy Q added to the system must equal the work W
done by the system during the cycle. That is, in a cyclic process,
⌬E int ⫽ 0

Cyclic process

and

Q⫽W

On a PV diagram, a cyclic process appears as a closed curve. (The processes described in Figure 20.5 are represented by open curves because the initial and ﬁnal
states differ.) It can be shown that in a cyclic process, the net work done by the
system per cycle equals the area enclosed by the path representing the
process on a PV diagram.
If the value of the work done by the system during some process is zero, then
the change in internal energy ⌬E int equals the energy transfer Q into or out of the
system:
⌬E int ⫽ Q
If energy enters the system, then Q is positive and the internal energy increases.
For a gas, we can associate this increase in internal energy with an increase in the
kinetic energy of the molecules. Conversely, if no energy transfer occurs during
some process but work is done by the system, then the change in internal energy
equals the negative value of the work done by the system:
⌬E int ⫽ ⫺W
6

For the deﬁnition of work from our mechanics studies, the ﬁrst law would be written as
⌬E int ⫽ Q ⫹ W because energy transfer into the system by either work or heat would increase the internal energy of the system. Because of the reversal of the deﬁnition of positive work discussed in Section
20.4, the ﬁrst law appears as in Equation 20.9, with a minus sign.
7

Note that dQ and dW are not true differential quantities; however, dE int is. Because dQ and dW are inexact differentials, they are often represented by the symbols dQ and d W . For further details on this
point, see an advanced text on thermodynamics, such as R. P. Bauman, Modern Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, New York, Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992.

619

20.6 Some Applications of the First Law of Thermodynamics

For example, if a gas is compressed by a moving piston in an insulated cylinder, no
energy is transferred by heat and the work done by the gas is negative; thus, the internal energy increases because kinetic energy is transferred from the moving piston to the gas molecules.
On a microscopic scale, no distinction exists between the result of heat and
that of work. Both heat and work can produce a change in the internal energy of a
system. Although the macroscopic quantities Q and W are not properties of a system, they are related to the change of the internal energy of a system through the
ﬁrst-law equation. Once we deﬁne a process, or path, we can either calculate or
measure Q and W, and we can ﬁnd the change in the system’s internal energy using the ﬁrst-law equation.
One of the important consequences of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is
that there exists a quantity known as internal energy whose value is determined
by the state of the system. The internal energy function is therefore called a state
function.

20.6

SOME APPLICATIONS OF THE FIRST LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS

Before we apply the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to speciﬁc systems, it is useful for
us to ﬁrst deﬁne some common thermodynamic processes. An adiabatic process
is one during which no energy enters or leaves the system by heat — that is, Q ⫽ 0.
An adiabatic process can be achieved either by thermally insulating the system
from its surroundings (as shown in Fig. 20.6b) or by performing the process
rapidly, so that there is little time for energy to transfer by heat. Applying the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics to an adiabatic process, we see that
⌬E int ⫽ ⫺W

(adiabatic process)

(20.10)

From this result, we see that if a gas expands adiabatically such that W is positive,
then ⌬E int is negative and the temperature of the gas decreases. Conversely, the
temperature of a gas increases when the gas is compressed adiabatically.
Adiabatic processes are very important in engineering practice. Some common examples are the expansion of hot gases in an internal combustion engine,
the liquefaction of gases in a cooling system, and the compression stroke in a
diesel engine.
The process described in Figure 20.6b, called an adiabatic free expansion, is
unique. The process is adiabatic because it takes place in an insulated container.
Because the gas expands into a vacuum, it does not apply a force on a piston as
was depicted in Figure 20.6a, so no work is done on or by the gas. Thus, in this adiabatic process, both Q ⫽ 0 and W ⫽ 0. As a result, ⌬E int ⫽ 0 for this process, as we
can see from the ﬁrst law. That is, the initial and ﬁnal internal energies of a
gas are equal in an adiabatic free expansion. As we shall see in the next chapter, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature. Thus, we
expect no change in temperature during an adiabatic free expansion. This prediction is in accord with the results of experiments performed at low pressures. (Experiments performed at high pressures for real gases show a slight decrease or increase in temperature after the expansion. This change is due to intermolecular
interactions, which represent a deviation from the model of an ideal gas.)
A process that occurs at constant pressure is called an isobaric process. In
such a process, the values of the heat and the work are both usually nonzero. The

work done by the gas is simply
W ⫽ P(Vf ⫺ Vi )

(20.11)

(isobaric process)

where P is the constant pressure.
A process that takes place at constant volume is called an isovolumetric
process. In such a process, the value of the work done is clearly zero because the
volume does not change. Hence, from the ﬁrst law we see that in an isovolumetric
process, because W ⫽ 0,
First-law equation for a constantvolume process

⌬E int ⫽ Q

(20.12)

(isovolumetric process)

This expression speciﬁes that if energy is added by heat to a system kept at
constant volume, then all of the transferred energy remains in the system as
an increase of the internal energy of the system. For example, when a can of
spray paint is thrown into a ﬁre, energy enters the system (the gas in the can) by
heat through the metal walls of the can. Consequently, the temperature, and thus
the pressure, in the can increases until the can possibly explodes.
A process that occurs at constant temperature is called an isothermal
process. A plot of P versus V at constant temperature for an ideal gas yields a hyperbolic curve called an isotherm. The internal energy of an ideal gas is a function
of temperature only. Hence, in an isothermal process involving an ideal gas,
⌬E int ⫽ 0. For an isothermal process, then, we conclude from the ﬁrst law that the
energy transfer Q must be equal to the work done by the gas — that is, Q ⫽ W. Any
energy that enters the system by heat is transferred out of the system by work; as a
result, no change of the internal energy of the system occurs.

In an isothermal process, T
remains constant.

Suppose that an ideal gas is allowed to expand quasi-statically at constant temperature, as described by the PV diagram shown in Figure 20.7. The curve is a hyperbola (see Appendix B, Eq. B.23), and the equation of state of an ideal gas with T
constant indicates that the equation of this curve is PV ⫽ constant. The isothermal
expansion of the gas can be achieved by placing the gas in thermal contact with an
energy reservoir at the same temperature, as shown in Figure 20.6a.
Let us calculate the work done by the gas in the expansion from state i to state
f. The work done by the gas is given by Equation 20.8. Because the gas is ideal and
the process is quasi-static, we can use the expression PV ⫽ nRT for each point on

the steam simply pushes the surrounding air out of the way.

To determine the change in internal energy, we must know

we have
Q ⫽ mL v ⫽ (1.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺3 kg)(2.26 ⫻ 10 6 J/kg) ⫽ 2 260 J
Hence, from the ﬁrst law, the change in internal energy is

of the system increases. We see that most (2 090 J/2 260 J ⫽

increasing the internal energy of the system. Only

Heating a Solid

A 1.0-kg bar of copper is heated at atmospheric pressure. If
its temperature increases from 20°C to 50°C, (a) what is the
work done by the copper on the surrounding atmosphere?

Solution

Because the process is isobaric, we can ﬁnd the
work done by the copper using Equation 20.11,
W ⫽ P(Vf ⫺ Vi ). We can calculate the change in volume of
the copper using Equation 19.6. Using the average linear expansion coefﬁcient for copper given in Table 19.2, and remembering that ␤ ⫽ 3␣, we obtain

ENERGY TRANSFER MECHANISMS

It is important to understand the rate at which energy is transferred between a system and its surroundings and the mechanisms responsible for the transfer. Therefore, let us now look at three common energy transfer mechanisms that can result
in a change in internal energy of a system.

Thermal Conduction
The energy transfer process that is most clearly associated with a temperature difference is thermal conduction. In this process, the transfer can be represented
on an atomic scale as an exchange of kinetic energy between microscopic particles — molecules, atoms, and electrons — in which less energetic particles gain energy in collisions with more energetic particles. For example, if you hold one end
of a long metal bar and insert the other end into a ﬂame, you will ﬁnd that the
temperature of the metal in your hand soon increases. The energy reaches your
hand by means of conduction. We can understand the process of conduction by
examining what is happening to the microscopic particles in the metal. Initially,
before the rod is inserted into the ﬂame, the microscopic particles are vibrating
about their equilibrium positions. As the ﬂame heats the rod, those particles near
the ﬂame begin to vibrate with greater and greater amplitudes. These particles, in
turn, collide with their neighbors and transfer some of their energy in the collisions. Slowly, the amplitudes of vibration of metal atoms and electrons farther and
farther from the ﬂame increase until, eventually, those in the metal near your
hand are affected. This increased vibration represents an increase in the temperature of the metal and of your potentially burned hand.
The rate of thermal conduction depends on the properties of the substance
being heated. For example, it is possible to hold a piece of asbestos in a ﬂame indeﬁnitely. This implies that very little energy is conducted through the asbestos. In
general, metals are good thermal conductors, and materials such as asbestos, cork,
paper, and ﬁberglass are poor conductors. Gases also are poor conductors because
the separation distance between the particles is so great. Metals are good thermal
conductors because they contain large numbers of electrons that are relatively free
to move through the metal and so can transport energy over large distances. Thus,
in a good conductor, such as copper, conduction takes place both by means of the
vibration of atoms and by means of the motion of free electrons.
Conduction occurs only if there is a difference in temperature between two
parts of the conducting medium. Consider a slab of material of thickness ⌬x and
cross-sectional area A. One face of the slab is at a temperature T1 , and the other
face is at a temperature T2 ⬎ T1 (Fig. 20.9). Experimentally, it is found that the

Melted snow pattern on a parking
lot surface indicates the presence
of underground hot water pipes
used to aid snow removal. Energy
from the water is conducted from
the pipes to the pavement, where it
causes the snow to melt.

624

CHAPTER 20

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

energy Q transferred in a time ⌬t ﬂows from the hotter face to the colder one. The
rate Q /⌬t at which this energy ﬂows is found to be proportional to the crosssectional area and the temperature difference ⌬T ⫽ T2 ⫺ T1 , and inversely proportional to the thickness:
Q
⌬T
⬀A
⌬t
⌬x
It is convenient to use the symbol for power ᏼ to represent the rate of energy
transfer: ᏼ ⫽ Q /⌬t. Note that ᏼ has units of watts when Q is in joules and ⌬t is in
seconds. For a slab of inﬁnitesimal thickness dx and temperature difference dT, we
can write the law of thermal conduction as

where the proportionality constant k is the thermal conductivity of the material
and 兩 dT/dx 兩 is the temperature gradient (the variation of temperature with position).
Suppose that a long, uniform rod of length L is thermally insulated so that energy cannot escape by heat from its surface except at the ends, as shown in Figure
20.10. One end is in thermal contact with an energy reservoir at temperature T1 ,
and the other end is in thermal contact with a reservoir at temperature T2 ⬎ T1 .
When a steady state has been reached, the temperature at each point along the
rod is constant in time. In this case if we assume that k is not a function of temperature, the temperature gradient is the same everywhere along the rod and is

Substances that are good thermal conductors have large thermal conductivity
values, whereas good thermal insulators have low thermal conductivity values.

generally better thermal conductors than nonmetals are.

equation results from a consideration of two thicknesses of materials.

Extension of this model to several slabs of materials leads to
Equation 20.16.

Home Insulation
In engineering practice, the term L/k for a particular substance is referred to as
the R value of the material. Thus, Equation 20.16 reduces to

where R i ⫽ L i /k i . The R values for a few common building materials are given in
Table 20.4. In the United States, the insulating properties of materials used in
buildings are usually expressed in engineering units, not SI units. Thus, in Table
20.4, measurements of R values are given as a combination of British thermal
units, feet, hours, and degrees Fahrenheit.
At any vertical surface open to the air, a very thin stagnant layer of air adheres
to the surface. One must consider this layer when determining the R value for a
wall. The thickness of this stagnant layer on an outside wall depends on the speed
of the wind. Energy loss from a house on a windy day is greater than the loss on a
day when the air is calm. A representative R value for this stagnant layer of air is
given in Table 20.4.

Convection
At one time or another, you probably have warmed your hands by holding them
over an open ﬂame. In this situation, the air directly above the ﬂame is heated and
expands. As a result, the density of this air decreases and the air rises. This warmed
mass of air heats your hands as it ﬂows by. Energy transferred by the movement
of a heated substance is said to have been transferred by convection. When
the movement results from differences in density, as with air around a ﬁre, it is referred to as natural convection. Air ﬂow at a beach is an example of natural convection, as is the mixing that occurs as surface water in a lake cools and sinks (see

628

CHAPTER 20

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

Chapter 19). When the heated substance is forced to move by a fan or pump, as in
some hot-air and hot-water heating systems, the process is called forced convection.
If it were not for convection currents, it would be very difﬁcult to boil water. As
water is heated in a teakettle, the lower layers are warmed ﬁrst. The heated water
expands and rises to the top because its density is lowered. At the same time, the
denser, cool water at the surface sinks to the bottom of the kettle and is heated.
The same process occurs when a room is heated by a radiator. The hot radiator warms the air in the lower regions of the room. The warm air expands and
rises to the ceiling because of its lower density. The denser, cooler air from above
sinks, and the continuous air current pattern shown in Figure 20.13 is established.

Convection currents are set up in a room heated
by a radiator.

Stefan’s law

Radiation
The third means of energy transfer that we shall discuss is radiation. All objects
radiate energy continuously in the form of electromagnetic waves (see Chapter
34) produced by thermal vibrations of the molecules. You are likely familiar with
electromagnetic radiation in the form of the orange glow from an electric stove
burner, an electric space heater, or the coils of a toaster.
The rate at which an object radiates energy is proportional to the fourth
power of its absolute temperature. This is known as Stefan’s law and is expressed
in equation form as
(20.18)
ᏼ ⫽ ␴AeT 4
where ᏼ is the power in watts radiated by the object, ␴ is a constant equal to
5.669 6 ⫻ 10⫺8 W/m2 ⭈ K4, A is the surface area of the object in square meters, e is
the emissivity constant, and T is the surface temperature in kelvins. The value of
e can vary between zero and unity, depending on the properties of the surface of
the object. The emissivity is equal to the fraction of the incoming radiation that
the surface absorbs.
Approximately 1 340 J of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun passes perpendicularly through each 1 m2 at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere every second.
This radiation is primarily visible and infrared light accompanied by a signiﬁcant
amount of ultraviolet radiation. We shall study these types of radiation in detail in
Chapter 34. Some of this energy is reﬂected back into space, and some is absorbed
by the atmosphere. However, enough energy arrives at the surface of the Earth
each day to supply all our energy needs on this planet hundreds of times over — if
only it could be captured and used efﬁciently. The growth in the number of solar
energy – powered houses built in this country reﬂects the increasing efforts being
made to use this abundant energy. Radiant energy from the Sun affects our day-today existence in a number of ways. For example, it inﬂuences the Earth’s average
temperature, ocean currents, agriculture, and rain patterns.
What happens to the atmospheric temperature at night is another example of
the effects of energy transfer by radiation. If there is a cloud cover above the
Earth, the water vapor in the clouds absorbs part of the infrared radiation emitted
by the Earth and re-emits it back to the surface. Consequently, temperature levels
at the surface remain moderate. In the absence of this cloud cover, there is nothing to prevent this radiation from escaping into space; thus the temperature decreases more on a clear night than on a cloudy one.
As an object radiates energy at a rate given by Equation 20.18, it also absorbs
electromagnetic radiation. If the latter process did not occur, an object would
eventually radiate all its energy, and its temperature would reach absolute zero.
The energy an object absorbs comes from its surroundings, which consist of other
objects that radiate energy. If an object is at a temperature T and its surroundings

629

20.7 Energy Transfer Mechanisms

are at a temperature T0 , then the net energy gained or lost each second by the object as a result of radiation is
ᏼnet ⫽ ␴Ae(T 4 ⫺ T04)

(20.19)

When an object is in equilibrium with its surroundings, it radiates and absorbs
energy at the same rate, and so its temperature remains constant. When an object
is hotter than its surroundings, it radiates more energy than it absorbs, and its temperature decreases. An ideal absorber is deﬁned as an object that absorbs all the
energy incident on it, and for such a body, e = 1. Such an object is often referred to
as a black body. An ideal absorber is also an ideal radiator of energy. In contrast,
an object for which e ⫽ 0 absorbs none of the energy incident on it. Such an object reﬂects all the incident energy, and thus is an ideal reﬂector.

The Dewar Flask
The Dewar ﬂask 8 is a container designed to minimize energy losses by conduction,
convection, and radiation. Such a container is used to store either cold or hot liquids for long periods of time. (A Thermos bottle is a common household equivalent of a Dewar ﬂask.) The standard construction (Fig. 20.14) consists of a doublewalled Pyrex glass vessel with silvered walls. The space between the walls is
evacuated to minimize energy transfer by conduction and convection. The silvered
surfaces minimize energy transfer by radiation because silver is a very good reﬂector and has very low emissivity. A further reduction in energy loss is obtained by reducing the size of the neck. Dewar ﬂasks are commonly used to store liquid nitrogen (boiling point: 77 K) and liquid oxygen (boiling point: 90 K).
To conﬁne liquid helium (boiling point: 4.2 K), which has a very low heat of
vaporization, it is often necessary to use a double Dewar system in which the Dewar
ﬂask containing the liquid is surrounded by a second Dewar ﬂask. The space between the two ﬂasks is ﬁlled with liquid nitrogen.
Newer designs of storage containers use “super insulation” that consists of
many layers of reﬂecting material separated by ﬁberglass. All of this is in a vacuum,
and no liquid nitrogen is needed with this design.

CHAPTER 20

Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics

SUMMARY
Internal energy is all of a system’s energy that is associated with the system’s microscopic components. Internal energy includes kinetic energy of translation, rotation, and vibration of molecules, potential energy within molecules, and potential
energy between molecules.
Heat is the transfer of energy across the boundary of a system resulting from a
temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. We use the symbol Q for the amount of energy transferred by this process.
The calorie is the amount of energy necessary to raise the temperature of 1 g
of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C. The mechanical equivalent of heat is 1 cal ⫽
4.186 J.
The heat capacity C of any sample is the amount of energy needed to raise
the temperature of the sample by 1°C. The energy Q required to change the temperature of a mass m of a substance by an amount ⌬T is
Q ⫽ mc⌬T

(20.4)

where c is the speciﬁc heat of the substance.
The energy required to change the phase of a pure substance of mass m is
Q ⫽ mL

(20.6)

where L is the latent heat of the substance and depends on the nature of the
phase change and the properties of the substance.
The work done by a gas as its volume changes from some initial value Vi to
some ﬁnal value Vf is

where P is the pressure, which may vary during the process. In order to evaluate
W, the process must be fully speciﬁed — that is, P and V must be known during
each step. In other words, the work done depends on the path taken between the
initial and ﬁnal states.
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics states that when a system undergoes a
change from one state to another, the change in its internal energy is
⌬E int ⫽ Q ⫺ W

(20.9)

where Q is the energy transferred into the system by heat and W is the work done
by the system. Although Q and W both depend on the path taken from the initial
state to the ﬁnal state, the quantity ⌬E int is path-independent. This central equation
is a statement of conservation of energy that includes changes in internal energy.
In a cyclic process (one that originates and terminates at the same state),
⌬E int ⫽ 0 and, therefore, Q ⫽ W. That is, the energy transferred into the system by
heat equals the work done by the system during the process.
In an adiabatic process, no energy is transferred by heat between the system
and its surroundings (Q ⫽ 0). In this case, the ﬁrst law gives ⌬E int ⫽ ⫺W. That is,
the internal energy changes as a consequence of work being done by the system.
In the adiabatic free expansion of a gas, Q ⫽ 0 and W ⫽ 0; thus, ⌬E int ⫽ 0. That
is, the internal energy of the gas does not change in such a process.
An isobaric process is one that occurs at constant pressure. The work done
in such a process is W ⫽ P(Vf ⫺ Vi ).
An isovolumetric process is one that occurs at constant volume. No work is
done in such a process, so ⌬E int ⫽ Q .

Energy may be transferred by work, which we addressed in Chapter 7, and by

21.1 Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas

I

n Chapter 19 we discussed the properties of an ideal gas, using such macroscopic variables as pressure, volume, and temperature. We shall now show that
such large-scale properties can be described on a microscopic scale, where matter is treated as a collection of molecules. Newton’s laws of motion applied in a statistical manner to a collection of particles provide a reasonable description of thermodynamic processes. To keep the mathematics relatively simple, we shall
consider molecular behavior of gases only, because in gases the interactions between molecules are much weaker than they are in liquids or solids. In the current
view of gas behavior, called the kinetic theory, gas molecules move about in a random fashion, colliding with the walls of their container and with each other. Perhaps the most important feature of this theory is that it demonstrates that the kinetic energy of molecular motion and the internal energy of a gas system are
equivalent. Furthermore, the kinetic theory provides us with a physical basis for
our understanding of the concept of temperature.
In the simplest model of a gas, each molecule is considered to be a hard
sphere that collides elastically with other molecules and with the container’s walls.
The hard-sphere model assumes that the molecules do not interact with each
other except during collisions and that they are not deformed by collisions. This
description is adequate only for monatomic gases, for which the energy is entirely
translational kinetic energy. One must modify the theory for more complex molecules, such as oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ), to include the internal energy associated with rotations and vibrations of the molecules.

MOLECULAR MODEL OF AN IDEAL GAS

We begin this chapter by developing a microscopic model of an ideal gas. The
model shows that the pressure that a gas exerts on the walls of its container is a
consequence of the collisions of the gas molecules with the walls. As we shall see,
the model is consistent with the macroscopic description of Chapter 19. In developing this model, we make the following assumptions:
• The number of molecules is large, and the average separation between mole-

•

•

•

•

cules is great compared with their dimensions. This means that the volume of
the molecules is negligible when compared with the volume of the container.
The molecules obey Newton’s laws of motion, but as a whole they move randomly. By “randomly” we mean that any molecule can move in any direction
with equal probability. We also assume that the distribution of speeds does not
change in time, despite the collisions between molecules. That is, at any given
moment, a certain percentage of molecules move at high speeds, a certain percentage move at low speeds, and a certain percentage move at speeds intermediate between high and low.
The molecules undergo elastic collisions with each other and with the walls of
the container. Thus, in the collisions, both kinetic energy and momentum are
constant.
The forces between molecules are negligible except during a collision. The
forces between molecules are short-range, so the molecules interact with each
other only during collisions.
The gas under consideration is a pure substance. That is, all of its molecules are
identical.

Although we often picture an ideal gas as consisting of single atoms, we can assume that the behavior of molecular gases approximates that of ideal gases rather

well at low pressures. Molecular rotations or vibrations have no effect, on the average, on the motions that we considered here.
Now let us derive an expression for the pressure of an ideal gas consisting of N
molecules in a container of volume V. The container is a cube with edges of length
d (Fig. 21.1). Consider the collision of one molecule moving with a velocity v toward the right-hand face of the box. The molecule has velocity components vx , vy ,
and vz . Previously, we used m to represent the mass of a sample, but throughout
this chapter we shall use m to represent the mass of one molecule. As the molecule
collides with the wall elastically, its x component of velocity is reversed, while its y
and z components of velocity remain unaltered (Fig. 21.2). Because the x component of the momentum of the molecule is mvx before the collision and ⫺ mvx after
the collision, the change in momentum of the molecule is
⌬px ⫽ ⫺mv x ⫺ (mv x ) ⫽ ⫺2mv x

where F1 is the magnitude of the average force exerted by the wall on the molecule in the time ⌬t. The subscript 1 indicates that we are currently considering
only one molecule. For the molecule to collide twice with the same wall, it must
travel a distance 2d in the x direction. Therefore, the time interval between two
collisions with the same wall is ⌬t ⫽ 2d/v x . Over a time interval that is long compared with ⌬t, the average force exerted on the molecule for each collision is

In this equation, vx1 is the x component of velocity of molecule 1, vx2 is the x component of velocity of molecule 2, and so on. The summation terminates when we
reach N molecules because there are N molecules in the container.
To proceed further, we must note that the average value of the square of the
velocity in the x direction for N molecules is

This result indicates that the pressure is proportional to the number of molecules per unit volume and to the average translational kinetic energy of the
molecules, 12mv 2. In deriving this simpliﬁed model of an ideal gas, we obtain an
important result that relates the large-scale quantity of pressure to an atomic quantity — the average value of the square of the molecular speed. Thus, we have established a key link between the atomic world and the large-scale world.
You should note that Equation 21.2 veriﬁes some features of pressure with
which you are probably familiar. One way to increase the pressure inside a container is to increase the number of molecules per unit volume in the container.
This is what you do when you add air to a tire. The pressure in the tire can also be
increased by increasing the average translational kinetic energy of the air molecules in the tire. As we shall soon see, this can be accomplished by increasing the
temperature of that air. It is for this reason that the pressure inside a tire increases
as the tire warms up during long trips. The continuous ﬂexing of the tire as it
moves along the surface of a road results in work done as parts of the tire distort
and in an increase in internal energy of the rubber. The increased temperature of
the rubber results in the transfer of energy by heat into the air inside the tire. This
transfer increases the air’s temperature, and this increase in temperature in turn
produces an increase in pressure.

That is, temperature is a direct measure of average molecular kinetic energy.

That is, the average translational kinetic energy per molecule is 32 k BT. Because

Thus, each translational degree of freedom contributes an equal amount of energy to the gas, namely, 12 k BT. (In general, “degrees of freedom” refers to the number of independent means by which a molecule can possess energy.) A generalization of this result, known as the theorem of equipartition of energy, states that
Theorem of equipartition of

each degree of freedom contributes 12 k BT to the energy of a system.
The total translational kinetic energy of N molecules of gas is simply N times

MOLAR SPECIFIC HEAT OF AN IDEAL GAS

The energy required to raise the temperature of n moles of gas from Ti to Tf depends on the path taken between the initial and ﬁnal states. To understand this,
let us consider an ideal gas undergoing several processes such that the change in
temperature is ⌬T ⫽ Tf ⫺ Ti for all processes. The temperature change can be
achieved by taking a variety of paths from one isotherm to another, as shown in
Figure 21.3. Because ⌬T is the same for each path, the change in internal energy
⌬E int is the same for all paths. However, we know from the ﬁrst law,
Q ⫽ ⌬E int ⫹ W, that the heat Q is different for each path because W (the area under the curves) is different for each path. Thus, the heat associated with a given
change in temperature does not have a unique value.

CHAPTER 21

The Kinetic Theory of Gases

We can address this difﬁculty by deﬁning speciﬁc heats for two processes that
frequently occur: changes at constant volume and changes at constant pressure.
Because the number of moles is a convenient measure of the amount of gas, we
deﬁne the molar speciﬁc heats associated with these processes with the following
equations:

Internal energy of an ideal
monatomic gas is proportional to
its temperature

Q ⫽ nC V ⌬T

(constant volume)

(21.8)

Q ⫽ nC P ⌬T

(constant pressure)

(21.9)

where CV is the molar speciﬁc heat at constant volume and CP is the molar
speciﬁc heat at constant pressure. When we heat a gas at constant pressure, not
only does the internal energy of the gas increase, but the gas also does work because of the change in volume. Therefore, the heat Q constant P must account for
both the increase in internal energy and the transfer of energy out of the system
by work, and so Q constant P is greater than Q constant V . Thus, CP is greater than CV .
In the previous section, we found that the temperature of a gas is a measure of
the average translational kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This kinetic energy is
associated with the motion of the center of mass of each molecule. It does not include the energy associated with the internal motion of the molecule — namely, vibrations and rotations about the center of mass. This should not be surprising because the simple kinetic theory model assumes a structureless molecule.
In view of this, let us ﬁrst consider the simplest case of an ideal monatomic
gas, that is, a gas containing one atom per molecule, such as helium, neon, or argon. When energy is added to a monatomic gas in a container of ﬁxed volume (by
heating, for example), all of the added energy goes into increasing the translational kinetic energy of the atoms. There is no other way to store the energy in a
monatomic gas. Therefore, from Equation 21.6, we see that the total internal energy E int of N molecules (or n mol) of an ideal monatomic gas is
E int ⫽ 32 Nk BT ⫽ 32 nRT

(21.10)

Note that for a monatomic ideal gas, E int is a function of T only, and the functional
relationship is given by Equation 21.10. In general, the internal energy of an ideal
gas is a function of T only, and the exact relationship depends on the type of gas,
as we shall soon explore.

Quick Quiz 21.2
How does the internal energy of a gas change as its pressure is decreased while its volume is
increased in such a way that the process follows the isotherm labeled T in Figure 21.4?
(a) E int increases. (b) E int decreases. (c) Eint stays the same. (d) There is not enough information to determine ⌬E int .

If energy is transferred by heat to a system at constant volume, then no work is
done by the system. That is, W ⫽ 冕P dV ⫽ 0 for a constant-volume process. Hence,
from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, we see that
Q ⫽ ⌬E int

(21.11)

In other words, all of the energy transferred by heat goes into increasing the internal energy (and temperature) of the system. A constant-volume process from i
to f is described in Figure 21.4, where ⌬T is the temperature difference between
the two isotherms. Substituting the expression for Q given by Equation 21.8 into

647

Equation 21.11, we obtain

P

⌬E int ⫽ nCV ⌬T

(21.12)
Isotherms

If the molar speciﬁc heat is constant, we can express the internal energy of a gas as

f

E int ⫽ nCVT
This equation applies to all ideal gases — to gases having more than one atom per
molecule, as well as to monatomic ideal gases.
In the limit of inﬁnitesimal changes, we can use Equation 21.12 to express the
molar speciﬁc heat at constant volume as
CV ⫽

1 dE int
n dT

(21.13)

Let us now apply the results of this discussion to the monatomic gas that we
have been studying. Substituting the internal energy from Equation 21.10 into
Equation 21.13, we ﬁnd that
(21.14)
CV ⫽ 32 R
This expression predicts a value of CV ⫽ 32 R ⫽ 12.5 J/mol⭈K for all monatomic
gases. This is in excellent agreement with measured values of molar speciﬁc heats
for such gases as helium, neon, argon, and xenon over a wide range of temperatures (Table 21.2).
Now suppose that the gas is taken along the constant-pressure path i : f ⬘
shown in Figure 21.4. Along this path, the temperature again increases by ⌬T. The
energy that must be transferred by heat to the gas in this process is Q ⫽ nCP ⌬T.
Because the volume increases in this process, the work done by the gas is
W ⫽ P⌬V, where P is the constant pressure at which the process occurs. Applying

In this case, the energy added to the gas by heat is channeled as follows: Part of it
does external work (that is, it goes into moving a piston), and the remainder increases the internal energy of the gas. But the change in internal energy for the
process i : f ⬘ is equal to that for the process i : f because E int depends only on
temperature for an ideal gas and because ⌬T is the same for both processes. In addition, because PV ⫽ nRT, we note that for a constant-pressure process,

Ratio of molar speciﬁc heats for a

(21.16)

This expression applies to any ideal gas. It predicts that the molar speciﬁc heat of
an ideal gas at constant pressure is greater than the molar speciﬁc heat at constant
volume by an amount R, the universal gas constant (which has the value
8.31 J/mol ⭈ K). This expression is applicable to real gases, as the data in Table 21.2
show.
Because CV ⫽ 32 R for a monatomic ideal gas, Equation 21.16 predicts a value
CP ⫽ 52 R ⫽ 20.8 J/mol⭈K for the molar speciﬁc heat of a monatomic gas at constant pressure. The ratio of these heat capacities is a dimensionless quantity ␥

Theoretical values of CP and ␥ are in excellent agreement with experimental values obtained for monatomic gases, but they are in serious disagreement with the
values for the more complex gases (see Table 21.2). This is not surprising because
the value CV ⫽ 32 R was derived for a monatomic ideal gas, and we expect some additional contribution to the molar speciﬁc heat from the internal structure of the
more complex molecules. In Section 21.4, we describe the effect of molecular
structure on the molar speciﬁc heat of a gas. We shall ﬁnd that the internal energy — and, hence, the molar speciﬁc heat — of a complex gas must include contributions from the rotational and the vibrational motions of the molecule.
We have seen that the molar speciﬁc heats of gases at constant pressure are
greater than the molar speciﬁc heats at constant volume. This difference is a consequence of the fact that in a constant-volume process, no work is done and all of
the energy transferred by heat goes into increasing the internal energy (and temperature) of the gas, whereas in a constant-pressure process, some of the energy
transferred by heat is transferred out as work done by the gas as it expands. In the
case of solids and liquids heated at constant pressure, very little work is done because the thermal expansion is small. Consequently, CP and CV are approximately
equal for solids and liquids.

ADIABATIC PROCESSES FOR AN IDEAL GAS

As we noted in Section 20.6, an adiabatic process is one in which no energy is
transferred by heat between a system and its surroundings. For example, if a gas is
compressed (or expanded) very rapidly, very little energy is transferred out of (or
into) the system by heat, and so the process is nearly adiabatic. (We must remember that the temperature of a system changes in an adiabatic process even though
no energy is transferred by heat.) Such processes occur in the cycle of a gasoline
engine, which we discuss in detail in the next chapter.
Another example of an adiabatic process is the very slow expansion of a gas
that is thermally insulated from its surroundings. In general,
an adiabatic process is one in which no energy is exchanged by heat between
a system and its surroundings.

Deﬁnition of an adiabatic process

Let us suppose that an ideal gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion. At any
time during the process, we assume that the gas is in an equilibrium state, so that
the equation of state PV ⫽ nRT is valid. As we shall soon see, the pressure and volume at any time during an adiabatic process are related by the expression
PV ␥ ⫽ constant

(21.18)

where ␥ ⫽ CP /CV is assumed to be constant during the process. Thus, we see that
all three variables in the ideal gas law — P, V, and T — change during an adiabatic
process.

Proof That PV ␥ ⴝ constant for an Adiabatic Process
When a gas expands adiabatically in a thermally insulated cylinder, no energy is
transferred by heat between the gas and its surroundings; thus, Q ⫽ 0. Let us take
the inﬁnitesimal change in volume to be dV and the inﬁnitesimal change in temperature to be dT. The work done by the gas is P dV. Because the internal energy
of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, the change in the internal energy in
an adiabatic expansion is the same as that for an isovolumetric process between
the same temperatures, dE int ⫽ nCV dT (Eq. 21.12). Hence, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, ⌬E int ⫽ Q ⫺ W, with Q ⫽ 0, becomes

deﬁnition of an adiabatic process, no energy is transferred by heat into or out of
the system. Hence, from the ﬁrst law, we see that ⌬E int is negative (the gas does
work, so its internal energy decreases) and so ⌬T also is negative. Thus, we see that
the gas cools (Tf ⬍ Ti ) during an adiabatic expansion. Conversely, the temperature increases if the gas is compressed adiabatically. Applying Equation 21.18 to

21.4 The Equipartition of Energy

21.4

THE EQUIPARTITION OF ENERGY

We have found that model predictions based on molar speciﬁc heat agree quite
well with the behavior of monatomic gases but not with the behavior of complex
gases (see Table 21.2). Furthermore, the value predicted by the model for the
quantity CP ⫺ CV ⫽ R is the same for all gases. This is not surprising because this
difference is the result of the work done by the gas, which is independent of its
molecular structure.
To clarify the variations in CV and CP in gases more complex than monatomic
gases, let us ﬁrst explain the origin of molar speciﬁc heat. So far, we have assumed
that the sole contribution to the internal energy of a gas is the translational kinetic
energy of the molecules. However, the internal energy of a gas actually includes
contributions from the translational, vibrational, and rotational motion of the
molecules. The rotational and vibrational motions of molecules can be activated
by collisions and therefore are “coupled” to the translational motion of the molecules. The branch of physics known as statistical mechanics has shown that, for a
large number of particles obeying the laws of Newtonian mechanics, the available
energy is, on the average, shared equally by each independent degree of freedom.
Recall from Section 21.1 that the equipartition theorem states that, at equilibrium,
each degree of freedom contributes 21k BT of energy per molecule.
Let us consider a diatomic gas whose molecules have the shape of a dumbbell
(Fig. 21.6). In this model, the center of mass of the molecule can translate in the
x, y, and z directions (Fig. 21.6a). In addition, the molecule can rotate about three
mutually perpendicular axes (Fig. 21.6b). We can neglect the rotation about the y
axis because the moment of inertia Iy and the rotational energy 12 I y␻ 2 about this
axis are negligible compared with those associated with the x and z axes. (If the
two atoms are taken to be point masses, then Iy is identically zero.) Thus, there are
ﬁve degrees of freedom: three associated with the translational motion and two associated with the rotational motion. Because each degree of freedom contributes,
on the average, 12 k BT of energy per molecule, the total internal energy for a system of N molecules is
E int ⫽ 3N(12 k BT ) ⫹ 2N(12 k BT ) ⫽ 52 Nk BT ⫽ 52 nRT
We can use this result and Equation 21.13 to ﬁnd the molar speciﬁc heat at constant volume:

These results agree quite well with most of the data for diatomic molecules
given in Table 21.2. This is rather surprising because we have not yet accounted
for the possible vibrations of the molecule. In the vibratory model, the two atoms
are joined by an imaginary spring (see Fig. 21.6c). The vibrational motion adds
two more degrees of freedom, which correspond to the kinetic energy and the potential energy associated with vibrations along the length of the molecule. Hence,
classical physics and the equipartition theorem predict an internal energy of

This value is inconsistent with experimental data for molecules such as H 2 and N 2
(see Table 21.2) and suggests a breakdown of our model based on classical physics.
For molecules consisting of more than two atoms, the number of degrees of
freedom is even larger and the vibrations are more complex. This results in an
even higher predicted molar speciﬁc heat, which is in qualitative agreement with
experiment. The more degrees of freedom available to a molecule, the more
“ways” it can store internal energy; this results in a higher molar speciﬁc heat.
We have seen that the equipartition theorem is successful in explaining some
features of the molar speciﬁc heat of gas molecules with structure. However, the
theorem does not account for the observed temperature variation in molar speciﬁc heats. As an example of such a temperature variation, CV for H 2 is 52 R from
about 250 K to 750 K and then increases steadily to about 72 R well above 750 K
(Fig. 21.7). This suggests that much more signiﬁcant vibrations occur at very high
temperatures. At temperatures well below 250 K, CV has a value of about 32 R, suggesting that the molecule has only translational energy at low temperatures.

A Hint of Energy Quantization
The failure of the equipartition theorem to explain such phenomena is due to the
inadequacy of classical mechanics applied to molecular systems. For a more satisfactory description, it is necessary to use a quantum-mechanical model, in which the
energy of an individual molecule is quantized. The energy separation between adjacent vibrational energy levels for a molecule such as H 2 is about ten times greater
than the average kinetic energy of the molecule at room temperature. Consequently, collisions between molecules at low temperatures do not provide enough
energy to change the vibrational state of the molecule. It is often stated that such degrees of freedom are “frozen out.” This explains why the vibrational energy does not
contribute to the molar speciﬁc heats of molecules at low temperatures.

653

21.5 The Boltzmann Distribution Law

The rotational energy levels also are quantized, but their spacing at ordinary
temperatures is small compared with k B T. Because the spacing between quantized
energy levels is small compared with the available energy, the system behaves in accordance with classical mechanics. However, at sufﬁciently low temperatures (typically less than 50 K), where k B T is small compared with the spacing between rotational levels, intermolecular collisions may not be sufﬁciently energetic to alter the
rotational states. This explains why CV reduces to 32 R for H 2 in the range from 20 K
to approximately 100 K.

The expressions for vibrational motions in the y and z directions are analogous.
Therefore, each atom of the solid has six degrees of freedom. According to the
equipartition theorem, this corresponds to an average vibrational energy of
6(12 k BT ) ⫽ 3k BT per atom. Therefore, the total internal energy of a solid consisting of N atoms is

The molar speciﬁc heats of solids also demonstrate a marked temperature dependence. Solids have molar speciﬁc heats that generally decrease in a nonlinear manner with decreasing temperature and approach zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. At high temperatures (usually above 300 K), the molar
speciﬁc heats approach the value of 3R ⬇ 25 J/mol⭈K, a result known as the
DuLong – Petit law. The typical data shown in Figure 21.8 demonstrate the temperature dependence of the molar speciﬁc heats for two semiconducting solids, silicon
and germanium.
We can explain the molar speciﬁc heat of a solid at high temperatures using
the equipartition theorem. For small displacements of an atom from its equilibrium position, each atom executes simple harmonic motion in the x, y, and z directions. The energy associated with vibrational motion in the x direction is

THE BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION LAW

Thus far we have neglected the fact that not all molecules in a gas have the same
speed and energy. In reality, their motion is extremely chaotic. Any individual molecule is colliding with others at an enormous rate — typically, a billion times per
second. Each collision results in a change in the speed and direction of motion of
each of the participant molecules. From Equation 21.7, we see that average molecular speeds increase with increasing temperature. What we would like to know now
is the relative number of molecules that possess some characteristic, such as a certain percentage of the total energy or speed. The ratio of the number of molecules

Figure 21.9 An atmospheric
layer of gas in equilibrium.

We begin by considering the distribution of molecules in our atmosphere. Let us
determine how the number of molecules per unit volume varies with altitude. Our
model assumes that the atmosphere is at a constant temperature T. (This assumption is not entirely correct because the temperature of our atmosphere decreases
by about 2°C for every 300-m increase in altitude. However, the model does illustrate the basic features of the distribution.)
According to the ideal gas law, a gas containing N molecules in thermal equilibrium obeys the relationship PV ⫽ Nk BT. It is convenient to rewrite this equation
in terms of the number density n V ⫽ N/V, which represents the number of molecules per unit volume of gas. This quantity is important because it can vary from
one point to another. In fact, our goal is to determine how nV changes in our atmosphere. We can express the ideal gas law in terms of nV as P ⫽ n V k BT. Thus, if
the number density nV is known, we can ﬁnd the pressure, and vice versa. The
pressure in the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude because a given
layer of air must support the weight of all the atmosphere above it — that is, the
greater the altitude, the less the weight of the air above that layer, and the lower
the pressure.
To determine the variation in pressure with altitude, let us consider an atmospheric layer of thickness dy and cross-sectional area A, as shown in Figure 21.9. Because the air is in static equilibrium, the magnitude PA of the upward force exerted on the bottom of this layer must exceed the magnitude of the downward
force on the top of the layer, (P ⫹ dP)A, by an amount equal to the weight of
gas in this thin layer. If the mass of a gas molecule in the layer is m, and if a total
of N molecules are in the layer, then the weight of the layer is given by mgN ⫽
mgn VV ⫽ mgn V Ady. Thus, we see that
PA ⫺ (P ⫹ dP)A ⫽ mgn V A dy
This expression reduces to
dP ⫽ ⫺mgn V dy
Because P ⫽ n V k BT and T is assumed to remain constant, we see that dP ⫽
k BT dn V . Substituting this result into the previous expression for dP and rearranging terms, we have
dn V

⫽⫺

Integrating this expression, we ﬁnd that

Law of atmospheres

n V (y) ⫽ n 0e ⫺mgy/k BT

(21.23)

where the constant n 0 is the number density at y ⫽ 0. This result is known as the
law of atmospheres.
According to Equation 21.23, the number density decreases exponentially
with increasing altitude when the temperature is constant. The number density of
our atmosphere at sea level is about n 0 ⫽ 2.69 ⫻ 10 25 molecules/m3. Because the
pressure is P ⫽ n V k BT, we see from Equation 21.23 that the pressure of our atmosphere varies with altitude according to the expression
P ⫽ P0e ⫺mgy/k BT

(21.24)

21.5 The Boltzmann Distribution Law

where P0 ⫽ n 0k BT. A comparison of this model with the actual atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude shows that the exponential form is a reasonable approximation to the Earth’s atmosphere.

EXAMPLE 21.4

High-Flying Molecules

What is the number density of air at an altitude of 11.0 km
(the cruising altitude of a commercial jetliner) compared
with its number density at sea level? Assume that the air temperature at this height is the same as that at the ground,
20°C.

Solution The number density of our atmosphere decreases exponentially with altitude according to the law of atmospheres, Equation 21.23. We assume an average molecular
mass of 28.9 u ⫽ 4.80 ⫻ 10 ⫺26 kg. Taking y ⫽ 11.0 km, we calculate the power of the exponential in Equation 21.23 to be
mg y
(4.80 ⫻ 10 ⫺26 kg)(9.80 m/s2 )(11 000 m )
⫽
⫽ 1.28
k BT
(1.38 ⫻ 10 ⫺23 J/K)(293 K)

Thus, Equation 21.23 gives
n V ⫽ n 0e ⫺mgy/k BT ⫽ n 0e ⫺1.28 ⫽ 0.278n 0
That is, the number density of air at an altitude of 11.0 km is
only 27.8% of the number density at sea level, if we assume
constant temperature. Because the temperature actually decreases with altitude, the number density of air is less than
this in reality.
The pressure at this height is reduced in the same manner. For this reason, high-ﬂying aircraft must have pressurized cabins to ensure passenger comfort and safety.

Computing Average Values
The exponential function e ⫺mgy/k BT that appears in Equation 21.23 can be interpreted as a probability distribution that gives the relative probability of ﬁnding a
gas molecule at some height y. Thus, the probability distribution p(y) is proportional to the number density distribution nV (y). This concept enables us to determine many properties of the atmosphere, such as the fraction of molecules below
a certain height or the average potential energy of a molecule.
As an example, let us determine the average height y of a molecule in the atmosphere at temperature T. The expression for this average height is

where the height of a molecule can range from 0 to ⬁. The numerator in this expression represents the sum of the heights of the molecules times their number,
while the denominator is the sum of the number of molecules. That is, the denominator is the total number of molecules. After performing the indicated integrations, we ﬁnd that
y⫽

(k BT/mg)2

⫽ B

This expression states that the average height of a molecule increases as T increases, as expected.
We can use a similar procedure to determine the average potential energy of a
gas molecule. Because the gravitational potential energy of a molecule at height y
is U ⫽ mgy, the average potential energy is equal to mgy. Because y ⫽ k BT/mg, we

656

CHAPTER 21

The Kinetic Theory of Gases

see that U ⫽ mg(k BT/mg) ⫽ k BT. This important result indicates that the average
gravitational potential energy of a molecule depends only on temperature, and
not on m or g.

The Boltzmann Distribution
Because the gravitational potential energy of a molecule at height y is U ⫽ mgy, we
can express the law of atmospheres (Eq. 21.23) as
n V ⫽ n 0e ⫺U/k BT
This means that gas molecules in thermal equilibrium are distributed in space with
a probability that depends on gravitational potential energy according to the exponential factor e ⫺U/k BT.
This exponential expression describing the distribution of molecules in the atmosphere is powerful and applies to any type of energy. In general, the number
density of molecules having energy E is
n V (E ) ⫽ n 0e ⫺E/k BT

Boltzmann distribution law

(21.25)

This equation is known as the Boltzmann distribution law and is important in
describing the statistical mechanics of a large number of molecules. It states that
the probability of ﬁnding the molecules in a particular energy state varies
exponentially as the negative of the energy divided by kB T. All the molecules
would fall into the lowest energy level if the thermal agitation at a temperature T
did not excite the molecules to higher energy levels.

EXAMPLE 21.5

Thermal Excitation of Atomic Energy Levels

As we discussed brieﬂy in Section 8.10, atoms can occupy only
certain discrete energy levels. Consider a gas at a temperature
of 2 500 K whose atoms can occupy only two energy levels
separated by 1.50 eV, where 1 eV (electron volt) is an energy
unit equal to 1.6 ⫻ 10⫺19 J (Fig. 21.10). Determine the ratio
of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the
number in the lower energy level.

Solution Equation 21.25 gives the relative number of
atoms in a given energy level. In this case, the atom has two
possible energies, E1 and E 2 , where E1 is the lower energy
level. Hence, the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher
energy level to the number in the lower energy level is

n(E 2 )
⫽ e ⫺1.50 eV/0.216 eV ⫽ e ⫺6.94 ⫽ 9.64 ⫻ 10 ⫺4
n(E 1)
This result indicates that at T ⫽ 2 500 K, only a small fraction
of the atoms are in the higher energy level. In fact, for every
atom in the higher energy level, there are about 1 000 atoms
in the lower level. The number of atoms in the higher level
increases at even higher temperatures, but the distribution
law speciﬁes that at equilibrium there are always more atoms
in the lower level than in the higher level.

21.6 Distribution of Molecular Speeds

21.6

DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR SPEEDS

In 1860 James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) derived an expression that describes
the distribution of molecular speeds in a very deﬁnite manner. His work and subsequent developments by other scientists were highly controversial because direct
detection of molecules could not be achieved experimentally at that time. However, about 60 years later, experiments were devised that conﬁrmed Maxwell’s predictions.
Let us consider a container of gas whose molecules have some distribution of
speeds. Suppose we want to determine how many gas molecules have a speed in
the range from, for example, 400 to 410 m/s. Intuitively, we expect that the speed
distribution depends on temperature. Furthermore, we expect that the distribution peaks in the vicinity of vrms . That is, few molecules are expected to have
speeds much less than or much greater than vrms because these extreme speeds result only from an unlikely chain of collisions.
The observed speed distribution of gas molecules in thermal equilibrium is
shown in Figure 21.11. The quantity Nv , called the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function, is deﬁned as follows: If N is the total number of molecules, then
the number of molecules with speeds between v and v ⫹ dv is dN ⫽ Nv dv. This
number is also equal to the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 21.11. Furthermore, the fraction of molecules with speeds between v and v ⫹ dv is Nv dv/N. This
fraction is also equal to the probability that a molecule has a speed in the range v
to v ⫹ dv.
The fundamental expression that describes the distribution of speeds of N gas
molecules is

As indicated in Figure 21.11, the average speed v is somewhat lower than the
rms speed. The most probable speed vmp is the speed at which the distribution curve
reaches a peak. Using Equation 21.26, one ﬁnds that
v rms ⫽ !v 2 ⫽ !3k BT/m ⫽ 1.73 !k BT/m

From these equations, we see that

speeds and at two temperatures. Note that the peak in the curve shifts to the right

The evaporation process

Equation 21.26 shows that the distribution of molecular speeds in a gas depends both on mass and on temperature. At a given temperature, the fraction of
molecules with speeds exceeding a ﬁxed value increases as the mass decreases.
This explains why lighter molecules, such as H 2 and He, escape more readily from
the Earth’s atmosphere than do heavier molecules, such as N 2 and O2 . (See the
discussion of escape speed in Chapter 14. Gas molecules escape even more readily
from the Moon’s surface than from the Earth’s because the escape speed on the
Moon is lower than that on the Earth.)
The speed distribution curves for molecules in a liquid are similar to those
shown in Figure 21.12. We can understand the phenomenon of evaporation of a
liquid from this distribution in speeds, using the fact that some molecules in the
liquid are more energetic than others. Some of the faster-moving molecules in
the liquid penetrate the surface and leave the liquid even at temperatures well below the boiling point. The molecules that escape the liquid by evaporation are
those that have sufﬁcient energy to overcome the attractive forces of the molecules in the liquid phase. Consequently, the molecules left behind in the liquid
phase have a lower average kinetic energy; as a result, the temperature of the liquid decreases. Hence, evaporation is a cooling process. For example, an alcoholsoaked cloth often is placed on a feverish head to cool and comfort a patient.

MEAN FREE PATH

Most of us are familiar with the fact that the strong odor associated with a gas such
as ammonia may take a fraction of a minute to diffuse throughout a room. However, because average molecular speeds are typically several hundred meters per
second at room temperature, we might expect a diffusion time much less than 1 s.
But, as we saw in Quick Quiz 21.1, molecules collide with one other because they
are not geometrical points. Therefore, they do not travel from one side of a room
to the other in a straight line. Between collisions, the molecules move with constant speed along straight lines. The average distance between collisions is called
the mean free path. The path of an individual molecule is random and resembles
that shown in Figure 21.13. As we would expect from this description, the mean
free path is related to the diameter of the molecules and the density of the gas.
We now describe how to estimate the mean free path for a gas molecule. For
this calculation, we assume that the molecules are spheres of diameter d. We see
from Figure 21.14a that no two molecules collide unless their centers are less than
a distance d apart as they approach each other. An equivalent way to describe the

CHAPTER 21

collisions is to imagine that one of the molecules has a diameter 2d and that the rest
are geometrical points (Fig. 21.14b). Let us choose the large molecule to be one
moving with the average speed v. In a time t, this molecule travels a distance vt. In
this time interval, the molecule sweeps out a cylinder having a cross-sectional area
␲d 2 and a length vt (Fig. 21.15). Hence, the volume of the cylinder is ␲d 2 vt. If nV is
the number of molecules per unit volume, then the number of point-size molecules
in the cylinder is (␲d 2 vt)n V . The molecule of equivalent diameter 2d collides with
every molecule in this cylinder in the time t. Hence, the number of collisions in the
time t is equal to the number of molecules in the cylinder, (␲d 2 vt)n V .
The mean free path ᐍ equals the average distance vt traveled in a time t divided by the number of collisions that occur in that time:

where v is its average speed. In this

CHAPTER 22

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

T

he ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, which we studied in Chapter 20, is a statement of conservation of energy, generalized to include internal energy. This
law states that a change in internal energy in a system can occur as a result of
energy transfer by heat or by work, or by both. As was stated in Chapter 20, the law
makes no distinction between the results of heat and the results of work — either
heat or work can cause a change in internal energy. However, an important distinction between the two is not evident from the ﬁrst law. One manifestation of this
distinction is that it is impossible to convert internal energy completely to mechanical energy by taking a substance through a thermodynamic cycle such as in a heat
engine, a device we study in this chapter.
Although the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is very important, it makes no distinction between processes that occur spontaneously and those that do not. However, we ﬁnd that only certain types of energy-conversion and energy-transfer
processes actually take place. The second law of thermodynamics, which we study in
this chapter, establishes which processes do and which do not occur in nature. The
following are examples of processes that proceed in only one direction, governed
by the second law:
• When two objects at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact with

each other, energy always ﬂows by heat from the warmer to the cooler, never
from the cooler to the warmer.
• A rubber ball dropped to the ground bounces several times and eventually
comes to rest, but a ball lying on the ground never begins bouncing on its own.
• An oscillating pendulum eventually comes to rest because of collisions with air
molecules and friction at the point of suspension. The mechanical energy of the
system is converted to internal energy in the air, the pendulum, and the suspension; the reverse conversion of energy never occurs.
All these processes are irreversible — that is, they are processes that occur naturally in one direction only. No irreversible process has ever been observed to run
backward — if it were to do so, it would violate the second law of thermodynamics.1
From an engineering standpoint, perhaps the most important implication of
the second law is the limited efﬁciency of heat engines. The second law states that
a machine capable of continuously converting internal energy completely to other
forms of energy in a cyclic process cannot be constructed.

HEAT ENGINES AND THE SECOND LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS

A heat engine is a device that converts internal energy to mechanical energy. For
instance, in a typical process by which a power plant produces electricity, coal or
some other fuel is burned, and the high-temperature gases produced are used to
convert liquid water to steam. This steam is directed at the blades of a turbine, setting it into rotation. The mechanical energy associated with this rotation is used to
drive an electric generator. Another heat engine — the internal combustion engine in an automobile — uses energy from a burning fuel to perform work that results in the motion of the automobile.
1

Although we have never observed a process occurring in the time-reversed sense, it is possible for it to
occur. As we shall see later in the chapter, however, such a process is highly improbable. From this viewpoint, we say that processes occur with a vastly greater probability in one direction than in the opposite
direction.

22.1 Heat Engines and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Lord Kelvin

British physicist and
mathematician (1824 – 1907) Born
William Thomson in Belfast, Kelvin
was the ﬁrst to propose the use of an
absolute scale of temperature. The
Kelvin temperature scale is named in
his honor. Kelvin’s work in thermodynamics led to the idea that energy
cannot pass spontaneously from a
colder body to a hotter body. (J. L.
Charmet /SPL /Photo Researchers, Inc.)

Figure 22.1 This steam-driven locomotive runs from Durango to Silverton, Colorado. It obtains its energy by burning wood or coal. The generated energy vaporizes water into steam, which
powers the locomotive. (This locomotive must take on water from tanks located along the route
to replace steam lost through the funnel.) Modern locomotives use diesel fuel instead of wood or
coal. Whether old-fashioned or modern, such locomotives are heat engines, which extract energy
from a burning fuel and convert a fraction of it to mechanical energy.

A heat engine carries some working substance through a cyclic process during
which (1) the working substance absorbs energy from a high-temperature energy
reservoir, (2) work is done by the engine, and (3) energy is expelled by the engine
to a lower-temperature reservoir. As an example, consider the operation of a steam
engine (Fig. 22.1), in which the working substance is water. The water in a boiler
absorbs energy from burning fuel and evaporates to steam, which then does work
by expanding against a piston. After the steam cools and condenses, the liquid water produced returns to the boiler and the cycle repeats.
It is useful to represent a heat engine schematically as in Figure 22.2. The engine absorbs a quantity of energy Q h from the hot reservoir, does work W, and
then gives up a quantity of energy Q c to the cold reservoir. Because the working
substance goes through a cycle, its initial and ﬁnal internal energies are equal, and
so E int  0. Hence, from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, E int  Q  W, and
with no change in internal energy, the net work W done by a heat engine is
equal to the net energy Q net ﬂowing through it. As we can see from Figure
22.2, Q net  Q h  Q c ; therefore,

In this expression and in many others throughout this chapter, to be consistent
with traditional treatments of heat engines, we take both Q h and Q c to be positive
quantities, even though Q c represents energy leaving the engine. In discussions of
heat engines, we shall describe energy leaving a system with an explicit minus sign,

Figure 22.2 Schematic representation of a heat engine. The engine
absorbs energy Q h from the hot
reservoir, expels energy Q c to the
cold reservoir, and does work W.

as in Equation 22.1. Also note that we model the energy input and output for the
heat engine as heat, as it often is; however, the energy transfer could occur by another mechanism.
The net work done in a cyclic process is the area enclosed by the curve
representing the process on a PV diagram. This is shown for an arbitrary cyclic
process in Figure 22.3.

The thermal efﬁciency e of a heat engine is deﬁned as the ratio of the net

temperature during the cycle:

We can think of the efﬁciency as the ratio of what you get (mechanical work)
to what you give (energy transfer at the higher temperature). In practice, we ﬁnd
that all heat engines expel only a fraction of the absorbed energy as mechanical
work and that consequently the efﬁciency is less than 100%. For example, a good
automobile engine has an efﬁciency of about 20%, and diesel engines have efﬁciencies ranging from 35% to 40%.
Equation 22.2 shows that a heat engine has 100% efﬁciency (e  1) only if
Q c  0 — that is, if no energy is expelled to the cold reservoir. In other words, a
heat engine with perfect efﬁciency would have to expel all of the absorbed energy
as mechanical work. On the basis of the fact that efﬁciencies of real engines are
well below 100%, the Kelvin – Planck form of the second law of thermodynamics states the following:
Kelvin–Planck statement of the
second law of thermodynamics

It is impossible to construct a heat engine that, operating in a cycle, produces
no effect other than the absorption of energy from a reservoir and the performance of an equal amount of work.
This statement of the second law means that, during the operation of a heat engine, W can never be equal to Q h , or, alternatively, that some energy Q c must be

rejected to the environment. Figure 22.4 is a schematic diagram of the impossible
“perfect” heat engine.
The ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics can be summarized as follows:
The ﬁrst law speciﬁes that we cannot get more energy out of a cyclic process
by work than the amount of energy we put in, and the second law states that
we cannot break even because we must put more energy in, at the higher
temperature, than the net amount of energy we get out by work.

Refrigerators and Heat Pumps
Refrigerators and heat pumps are heat engines running in reverse. Here, we introduce them brieﬂy for the purposes of developing an alternate statement of the
second law; we shall discuss them more fully in Section 22.5.
In a refrigerator or heat pump, the engine absorbs energy Q c from a cold
reservoir and expels energy Q h to a hot reservoir (Fig. 22.5). This can be accomplished only if work is done on the engine. From the ﬁrst law, we know that the energy given up to the hot reservoir must equal the sum of the work done and the
energy absorbed from the cold reservoir. Therefore, the refrigerator or heat pump
transfers energy from a colder body (for example, the contents of a kitchen refrigerator or the winter air outside a building) to a hotter body (the air in the kitchen
or a room in the building). In practice, it is desirable to carry out this process with
a minimum of work. If it could be accomplished without doing any work, then the
refrigerator or heat pump would be “perfect” (Fig. 22.6). Again, the existence of

CHAPTER 22

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

such a device would be in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, which in
the form of the Clausius statement2 states:
It is impossible to construct a cyclical machine whose sole effect is the continuous transfer of energy from one object to another object at a higher temperature without the input of energy by work.

Clausius statement of the second
law of thermodynamics

In simpler terms, energy does not ﬂow spontaneously from a cold object to a
hot object. For example, we cool homes in summer using heat pumps called air
conditioners. The air conditioner pumps energy from the cool room in the home to
the warm air outside. This direction of energy transfer requires an input of energy
to the air conditioner, which is supplied by the electric power company.
The Clausius and Kelvin – Planck statements of the second law of thermodynamics appear, at ﬁrst sight, to be unrelated, but in fact they are equivalent in all
respects. Although we do not prove so here, if either statement is false, then so is
the other.3

REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES

In the next section we discuss a theoretical heat engine that is the most efﬁcient
possible. To understand its nature, we must ﬁrst examine the meaning of reversible and irreversible processes. In a reversible process, the system undergoing
the process can be returned to its initial conditions along the same path shown on
a PV diagram, and every point along this path is an equilibrium state. A process
that does not satisfy these requirements is irreversible.
All natural processes are known to be irreversible. From the endless number
of examples that could be selected, let us examine the adiabatic free expansion of
a gas, which was already discussed in Section 20.6, and show that it cannot be reversible. The system that we consider is a gas in a thermally insulated container, as
shown in Figure 22.7. A membrane separates the gas from a vacuum. When the
membrane is punctured, the gas expands freely into the vacuum. As a result of
the puncture, the system has changed because it occupies a greater volume after
the expansion. Because the gas does not exert a force through a distance on the
surroundings, it does no work on the surroundings as it expands. In addition, no
energy is transferred to or from the gas by heat because the container is insulated
from its surroundings. Thus, in this adiabatic process, the system has changed but
the surroundings have not.
For this process to be reversible, we need to be able to return the gas to its
original volume and temperature without changing the surroundings. Imagine
that we try to reverse the process by compressing the gas to its original volume. To
do so, we ﬁt the container with a piston and use an engine to force the piston inward. During this process, the surroundings change because work is being done by
an outside agent on the system. In addition, the system changes because the compression increases the temperature of the gas. We can lower the temperature of
the gas by allowing it to come into contact with an external energy reservoir. Although this step returns the gas to its original conditions, the surroundings are

22.3 The Carnot Engine

again affected because energy is being added to the surroundings from the gas. If
this energy could somehow be used to drive the engine that we have used to compress the gas, then the net energy transfer to the surroundings would be zero. In
this way, the system and its surroundings could be returned to their initial conditions, and we could identify the process as reversible. However, the Kelvin – Planck
statement of the second law speciﬁes that the energy removed from the gas to return the temperature to its original value cannot be completely converted to mechanical energy in the form of the work done by the engine in compressing the
gas. Thus, we must conclude that the process is irreversible.
We could also argue that the adiabatic free expansion is irreversible by relying
on the portion of the deﬁnition of a reversible process that refers to equilibrium
states. For example, during the expansion, signiﬁcant variations in pressure occur
throughout the gas. Thus, there is no well-deﬁned value of the pressure for the entire system at any time between the initial and ﬁnal states. In fact, the process cannot
even be represented as a path on a PV diagram. The PV diagram for an adiabatic
free expansion would show the initial and ﬁnal conditions as points, but these points
would not be connected by a path. Thus, because the intermediate conditions between the initial and ﬁnal states are not equilibrium states, the process is irreversible.
Although all real processes are always irreversible, some are almost reversible.
If a real process occurs very slowly such that the system is always very nearly in an
equilibrium state, then the process can be approximated as reversible. For example, let us imagine that we compress a gas very slowly by dropping some grains of
sand onto a frictionless piston, as shown in Figure 22.8. We make the process
isothermal by placing the gas in thermal contact with an energy reservoir, and we
transfer just enough energy from the gas to the reservoir during the process to
keep the temperature constant. The pressure, volume, and temperature of the gas
are all well deﬁned during the isothermal compression, so each state during the
process is an equilibrium state. Each time we add a grain of sand to the piston, the
volume of the gas decreases slightly while the pressure increases slightly. Each
grain we add represents a change to a new equilibrium state. We can reverse the
process by slowly removing grains from the piston.
A general characteristic of a reversible process is that no dissipative effects
(such as turbulence or friction) that convert mechanical energy to internal energy
can be present. Such effects can be impossible to eliminate completely. Hence, it is
not surprising that real processes in nature are irreversible.

THE CARNOT ENGINE

In 1824 a French engineer named Sadi Carnot described a theoretical engine,
now called a Carnot engine, that is of great importance from both practical and
theoretical viewpoints. He showed that a heat engine operating in an ideal, reversible cycle — called a Carnot cycle — between two energy reservoirs is the most
efﬁcient engine possible. Such an ideal engine establishes an upper limit on the
efﬁciencies of all other engines. That is, the net work done by a working substance
taken through the Carnot cycle is the greatest amount of work possible for a given
amount of energy supplied to the substance at the upper temperature. Carnot’s
theorem can be stated as follows:
No real heat engine operating between two energy reservoirs can be more efﬁcient than a Carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs.

(1796 – 1832) Carnot was the ﬁrst to
show the quantitative relationship between work and heat. In 1824 he published his only work — Reﬂections on
the Motive Power of Heat — which
reviewed the industrial, political, and
economic importance of the steam
engine. In it, he deﬁned work as
“weight lifted through a height.”

To argue the validity of this theorem, let us imagine two heat engines operating
between the same energy reservoirs. One is a Carnot engine with efﬁciency e C , and
the other is an engine with efﬁciency e, which is greater than e C . We use the more
efﬁcient engine to drive the Carnot engine as a Carnot refrigerator. Thus, the output by work of the more efﬁcient engine is matched to the input by work of the

22.3 The Carnot Engine

Carnot refrigerator. For the combination of the engine and refrigerator, then, no
exchange by work with the surroundings occurs. Because we have assumed that
the engine is more efﬁcient than the refrigerator, the net result of the combination is a transfer of energy from the cold to the hot reservoir without work being
done on the combination. According to the Clausius statement of the second law,
this is impossible. Hence, the assumption that e  e C must be false. All real engines are less efﬁcient than the Carnot engine because they do not operate
through a reversible cycle. The efﬁciency of a real engine is further reduced by
such practical difﬁculties as friction and energy losses by conduction.
To describe the Carnot cycle taking place between temperatures Tc and Th , we
assume that the working substance is an ideal gas contained in a cylinder ﬁtted
with a movable piston at one end. The cylinder’s walls and the piston are thermally nonconducting. Four stages of the Carnot cycle are shown in Figure 22.9,
and the PV diagram for the cycle is shown in Figure 22.10. The Carnot cycle consists of two adiabatic processes and two isothermal processes, all reversible:
1. Process A : B (Fig. 22.9a) is an isothermal expansion at temperature Th . The
gas is placed in thermal contact with an energy reservoir at temperature Th .
During the expansion, the gas absorbs energy Q h from the reservoir through
the base of the cylinder and does work WAB in raising the piston.
2. In process B : C (Fig. 22.9b), the base of the cylinder is replaced by a thermally nonconducting wall, and the gas expands adiabatically — that is, no energy enters or leaves the system. During the expansion, the temperature of
the gas decreases from Th to Tc and the gas does work WBC in raising the
piston.
3. In process C : D (Fig. 22.9c), the gas is placed in thermal contact with an energy reservoir at temperature Tc and is compressed isothermally at temperature
Tc . During this time, the gas expels energy Q c to the reservoir, and the work
done by the piston on the gas is WCD .
4. In the ﬁnal process D : A (Fig. 22.9d), the base of the cylinder is replaced by a
nonconducting wall, and the gas is compressed adiabatically. The temperature
of the gas increases to Th , and the work done by the piston on the gas is WDA .

The net work done in this reversible, cyclic process is equal to the area enclosed by the path ABCDA in Figure 22.10. As we demonstrated in Section 22.1,
because the change in internal energy is zero, the net work W done in one cycle
equals the net energy transferred into the system, Q h  Q c . The thermal efﬁciency

CHAPTER 22

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Equation 22.4 can be applied to any working substance operating in a Carnot
cycle between two energy reservoirs. According to this equation, the efﬁciency is
zero if Tc  Th , as one would expect. The efﬁciency increases as Tc is lowered and
as Th is raised. However, the efﬁciency can be unity (100%) only if Tc  0 K. Such
reservoirs are not available; thus, the maximum efﬁciency is always less than 100%.
In most practical cases, Tc is near room temperature, which is about 300 K. Therefore, one usually strives to increase the efﬁciency by raising Th .

EXAMPLE 22.2

Efﬁciency of the Carnot Engine

Show that the efﬁciency of a heat engine operating in a
Carnot cycle using an ideal gas is given by Equation 22.4.

Solution During the isothermal expansion (process A : B
in Figure 22.9), the temperature does not change. Thus, the
internal energy remains constant. The work done by a gas
during an isothermal expansion is given by Equation 20.13.
According to the ﬁrst law, this work is equal to Q h , the energy
absorbed, so that

In a similar manner, the energy transferred to the cold reservoir during the isothermal compression C : D is

The Steam Engine

A steam engine has a boiler that operates at 500 K. The energy from the burning fuel changes water to steam, and this
steam then drives a piston. The cold reservoir’s temperature
is that of the outside air, approximately 300 K. What is the
maximum thermal efﬁciency of this steam engine?

GASOLINE AND DIESEL ENGINES

In a gasoline engine, six processes occur in each cycle; ﬁve of these are illustrated
in Figure 22.11. In this discussion, we consider the interior of the cylinder above
the piston to be the system that is taken through repeated cycles in the operation
of the engine. For a given cycle, the piston moves up and down twice. This represents a four-stroke cycle consisting of two upstrokes and two downstrokes. The
processes in the cycle can be approximated by the Otto cycle, a PV diagram of
which is illustrated in Figure 22.12:
1. During the intake stroke O : A (Fig. 22.11a), the piston moves downward, and a
gaseous mixture of air and fuel is drawn into the cylinder at atmospheric pressure. In this process, the volume increases from V2 to V1 . This is the energy input part of the cycle, as energy enters the system (the interior of the cylinder)
as internal energy stored in the fuel. This is energy transfer by mass transfer —
that is, the energy is carried with a substance. It is similar to convection, which
we studied in Chapter 20.
2. During the compression stroke A : B (Fig. 22.11b), the piston moves upward, the
air – fuel mixture is compressed adiabatically from volume V1 to volume V2 , and
the temperature increases from TA to TB . The work done by the gas is negative,
and its value is equal to the area under the curve AB in Figure 22.12.
3. In process B : C, combustion occurs when the spark plug ﬁres (Fig. 22.11c).
This is not one of the strokes of the cycle because it occurs in a very short
period of time while the piston is at its highest position. The combustion represents a rapid transformation from internal energy stored in chemical bonds in
the fuel to internal energy associated with molecular motion, which is related
to temperature. During this time, the pressure and temperature in the cylinder
increase rapidly, with the temperature rising from TB to TC . The volume, however, remains approximately constant because of the short time interval. As a result, approximately no work is done by the gas. We can model this process in
the PV diagram (Fig. 22.12) as that process in which the energy Q h enters the
system. However, in reality this process is a transformation of energy already in
the cylinder (from process O : A) rather than a transfer.
4. In the power stroke C : D (Fig. 22.11d), the gas expands adiabatically from V2 to

V1 . This expansion causes the temperature to drop from TC to TD . Work is
done by the gas in pushing the piston downward, and the value of this work is
equal to the area under the curve CD.
5. In the process D : A (not shown in Fig. 22.11), an exhaust valve is opened as
the piston reaches the bottom of its travel, and the pressure suddenly drops for
a short time interval. During this interval, the piston is almost stationary and
the volume is approximately constant. Energy is expelled from the interior of
the cylinder and continues to be expelled during the next process.
6. In the ﬁnal process, the exhaust stroke A : O (Fig. 22.11e), the piston moves upward while the exhaust valve remains open. Residual gases are exhausted at atmospheric pressure, and the volume decreases from V1 to V2 . The cycle then
repeats.
If the air – fuel mixture is assumed to be an ideal gas, then the efﬁciency of the
Otto cycle is

(22.5)

where  is the ratio of the molar speciﬁc heats CP /CV for the fuel – air mixture and
V1 /V2 is the compression ratio. Equation 22.5, which we derive in Example 22.5,
shows that the efﬁciency increases as the compression ratio increases. For a typical
compression ratio of 8 and with   1.4, we predict a theoretical efﬁciency of 56%
for an engine operating in the idealized Otto cycle. This value is much greater
than that achieved in real engines (15% to 20%) because of such effects as friction, energy transfer by conduction through the cylinder walls, and incomplete
combustion of the air – fuel mixture.
Diesel engines operate on a cycle similar to the Otto cycle but do not employ a
spark plug. The compression ratio for a diesel engine is much greater than that

681

22.4 Gasoline and Diesel Engines

for a gasoline engine. Air in the cylinder is compressed to a very small volume,
and, as a consequence, the cylinder temperature at the end of the compression
stroke is very high. At this point, fuel is injected into the cylinder. The temperature
is high enough for the fuel – air mixture to ignite without the assistance of a spark
plug. Diesel engines are more efﬁcient than gasoline engines because of their
greater compression ratios and resulting higher combustion temperatures.

EXAMPLE 22.5

Efﬁciency of the Otto Cycle

Show that the thermal efﬁciency of an engine operating in an
idealized Otto cycle (see Figs. 22.11 and 22.12) is given by
Equation 22.5. Treat the working substance as an ideal gas.

Solution First, let us calculate the work done by the gas
during each cycle. No work is done during processes B : C
and D : A. The work done by the gas during the adiabatic
compression A : B is negative, and the work done by the gas
during the adiabatic expansion C : D is positive. The value
of the net work done equals the area of the shaded region
bounded by the closed curve in Figure 22.12. Because the
change in internal energy for one cycle is zero, we see from
the ﬁrst law that the net work done during one cycle equals
the net energy ﬂow through the system:
W  Qh  Qc
Because processes B : C and D : A take place at constant
volume, and because the gas is ideal, we ﬁnd from the deﬁnition of molar speciﬁc heat (Eq. 21.8) that

We can simplify this expression by noting that processes

During the Otto cycle, the lowest temperature is TA and the
highest temperature is TC . Therefore, the efﬁciency of a
Carnot engine operating between reservoirs at these two
temperatures, which is given by the expression e C 
1  (TA /TC ), is greater than the efﬁciency of the Otto cycle
given by (6), as expected.

Models of Gasoline and Diesel Engines

We can use the thermodynamic principles discussed in this
and earlier chapters to model the performance of gasoline
and diesel engines. In both types of engine, a gas is ﬁrst compressed in the cylinders of the engine and then the fuel – air
mixture is ignited. Work is done on the gas during compression, but signiﬁcantly more work is done on the piston by the

mixture as the products of combustion expand in the cylinder.
The power of the engine is transferred from the piston to the
crankshaft by the connecting rod.
Two important quantities of either engine are the displacement volume, which is the volume displaced by the piston as it
moves from the bottom to the top of the cylinder, and the com-

pression ratio r, which is the ratio of the maximum and minimum volumes of the cylinder (see p. 680). In our notation,
r  VA /VB , or V1 /V2 in Eq. 22.5. Most gasoline and diesel engines operate with a four-cycle process (intake, compression,
power, exhaust), in which the net work of the intake and exhaust cycles can be considered negligible. Therefore, power
is developed only once for every two revolutions of the crankshaft.
In a diesel engine, only air (and no fuel) is present in the
cylinder at the beginning of the compression. In the idealized diesel cycle of Figure 22.13, air in the cylinder undergoes an adiabatic compression from A to B. Starting at B, fuel
is injected into the cylinder in such a way that the fuel – air
mixture undergoes a constant-pressure expansion to an intermediate volume VC (B : C ). The high temperature of the
mixture causes combustion, and the power stroke is an adiabatic expansion back to VD  VA(C : D). The exhaust valve
is opened, and a constant-volume output of energy occurs
(D : A) as the cylinder empties.
To simplify our calculations, we assume that the mixture
in the cylinder is air modeled as an ideal gas. We use speciﬁc
heats c instead of molar speciﬁc heats C and assume constant values for air at 300 K. We express the speciﬁc heats
and the universal gas constant in terms of unit masses rather
than moles. Thus, cV  0.718 kJ/kg  K, cP  1.005 kJ/kg  K,

Let us calculate the power delivered by a six-cylinder gasoline
engine that has a displacement volume of 3.00 L operating at
4 000 rpm and having a compression ratio of r  9.50. The
air – fuel mixture enters a cylinder at atmospheric pressure
and an ambient temperature of 27°C. During combustion,
the mixture reaches a temperature of 1 350°C.
First, let us calculate the work done by an individual cylinder. Using the initial pressure PA  100 kPa and the initial
temperature TA  300 K, we calculate the initial volume and
the mass of the air – fuel mixture. We know that the ratio of
the initial and ﬁnal volumes is the compression ratio,

A 2.00-L Diesel Engine
Let us calculate the power delivered by a four-cylinder diesel
engine that has a displacement volume of 2.00 L and is
operating at 3 000 rpm. The compression ratio is
r  VA /VB  22.0, and the cutoff ratio, which is the ratio
of the volume change during the constant-pressure process
B : C in Figure 22.13, is r c  VC /VB  2.00. The air enters
each cylinder at the beginning of the compression cycle at atmospheric pressure and at an ambient temperature of 27°C.
Our model of the diesel engine is similar to our model of
the gasoline engine except that now the fuel is injected at
point B and the mixture self-ignites near the end of the compression cycle A : B , when the temperature reaches the ignition temperature. We assume that the energy input occurs in
the constant-pressure process B : C , and that the expansion
process continues from C to D with no further energy transfer
by heat.
Let us calculate the work done by an individual cylinder
that has an initial volume of VA  (2.00  10 3 m3 )/4 
0.500  10 3 m3. Because the compression ratio is quite
high, we approximate the maximum cylinder volume to be
the displacement volume. Using the initial pressure PA 

the mass of the air in the cylinder using the ideal gas law:

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

HEAT PUMPS AND REFRIGERATORS

In Section 22.1 we introduced a heat pump as a mechanical device that moves energy from a region at lower temperature to a region at higher temperature. Heat
pumps have long been used for cooling homes and buildings, and they are now
becoming increasingly popular for heating them as well. The heat pump contains
two sets of metal coils that can exchange energy by heat with the surroundings:
one set on the outside of the building, in contact with the air or buried in the
ground; and the other set in the interior of the building. In the heating mode, a
circulating ﬂuid ﬂowing through the coils absorbs energy from the outside and releases it to the interior of the building from the interior coils. The ﬂuid is cold and
at low pressure when it is in the external coils, where it absorbs energy by heat
from either the air or the ground. The resulting warm ﬂuid is then compressed
and enters the interior coils as a hot, high-pressure ﬂuid, where it releases its
stored energy to the interior air.
An air conditioner is simply a heat pump operating in the cooling mode, with
its exterior and interior coils interchanged. Energy is absorbed into the circulating
ﬂuid in the interior coils; then, after the ﬂuid is compressed, energy leaves the
ﬂuid through the external coils. The air conditioner must have a way to release energy to the outside. Otherwise, the work done on the air conditioner would represent energy added to the air inside the house, and the temperature would increase. In the same manner, a refrigerator cannot cool the kitchen if the
refrigerator door is left open. The amount of energy leaving the external coils
(Fig. 22.14) behind or underneath the refrigerator is greater than the amount of
energy removed from the food or from the air in the kitchen if the door is left
open. The difference between the energy out and the energy in is the work done
by the electricity supplied to the refrigerator.
Figure 22.15 is a schematic representation of a heat pump. The cold temperature is Tc , the hot temperature is Th , and the energy absorbed by the circulating
ﬂuid is Q c . The heat pump does work W on the ﬂuid, and the energy transferred
from the pump to the building in the heating mode is Q h .
The effectiveness of a heat pump is described in terms of a number called the
coefﬁcient of performance (COP). In the heating mode, the COP is deﬁned as
the ratio of the energy transferred to the hot reservoir to the work required to
transfer that energy:
COP (heating mode) ⬅

Figure 22.14

The coils on the
back of a refrigerator transfer energy by heat to the air. The second
law of thermodynamics states that
this amount of energy must be
greater than the amount of energy
removed from the contents of the
refrigerator (or from the air in the
kitchen, if the refrigerator door is
left open).

Note that the COP is similar to the thermal efﬁciency for a heat engine in that it is
a ratio of what you get (energy delivered to the interior of the building) to what
you give (work input). Because Q h is generally greater than W, typical values for the
COP are greater than unity. It is desirable for the COP to be as high as possible, just
as it is desirable for the thermal efﬁciency of an engine to be as high as possible.
If the outside temperature is 25°F or higher, then the COP for a heat pump is
about 4. That is, the amount of energy transferred to the building is about four
times greater than the work done by the motor in the heat pump. However, as the
outside temperature decreases, it becomes more difﬁcult for the heat pump to extract sufﬁcient energy from the air, and so the COP decreases. In fact, the COP
can fall below unity for temperatures below the midteens. Thus, the use of heat
pumps that extract energy from the air, while satisfactory in moderate climates, is
not appropriate in areas where winter temperatures are very low. It is possible to

685

22.6 Entropy

use heat pumps in colder areas by burying the external coils deep in the ground.
In this case, the energy is extracted from the ground, which tends to be warmer
than the air in the winter.

Note that this diagram is the same
as that for the refrigerator shown
in Figure 22.5.

For a heat pump operating in the cooling mode, “what you get” is energy removed from the cold reservoir. The most effective refrigerator or air conditioner is
one that removes the greatest amount of energy from the cold reservoir in exchange for the least amount of work. Thus, for these devices we deﬁne the COP in
terms of Q c :

As the difference between the temperatures of the two reservoirs approaches zero

ENTROPY

The zeroth law of thermodynamics involves the concept of temperature, and the
ﬁrst law involves the concept of internal energy. Temperature and internal energy
are both state functions — that is, they can be used to describe the thermodynamic
state of a system. Another state function — this one related to the second law of
thermodynamics — is entropy S. In this section we deﬁne entropy on a macroscopic scale as it was ﬁrst expressed by Clausius in 1865.

CHAPTER 22

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Consider any inﬁnitesimal process in which a system changes from one equilibrium state to another. If dQ r is the amount of energy transferred by heat when
the system follows a reversible path between the states, then the change in entropy
dS is equal to this amount of energy for the reversible process divided by the absolute temperature of the system:
Clausius deﬁnition of change in
entropy

dS 

dQ r
T

(22.8)

We have assumed that the temperature is constant because the process is inﬁnitesimal. Since we have claimed that entropy is a state function, the change in entropy during a process depends only on the end points and therefore is independent of the actual path followed.
The subscript r on the quantity dQ r is a reminder that the transferred energy is
to be measured along a reversible path, even though the system may actually have
followed some irreversible path. When energy is absorbed by the system, dQ r is
positive and the entropy of the system increases. When energy is expelled by the
system, dQ r is negative and the entropy of the system decreases. Note that Equation 22.8 deﬁnes not entropy but rather the change in entropy. Hence, the meaningful quantity in describing a process is the change in entropy.
Entropy was originally formulated as a useful concept in thermodynamics;
however, its importance grew tremendously as the ﬁeld of statistical mechanics developed because the analytical techniques of statistical mechanics provide an alternative means of interpreting entropy. In statistical mechanics, the behavior of a
substance is described in terms of the statistical behavior of its atoms and molecules. One of the main results of this treatment is that isolated systems tend toward disorder and that entropy is a measure of this disorder. For example,
consider the molecules of a gas in the air in your room. If half of the gas molecules had velocity vectors of equal magnitude directed toward the left and the
other half had velocity vectors of the same magnitude directed toward the right,
the situation would be very ordered. However, such a situation is extremely unlikely. If you could actually view the molecules, you would see that they move haphazardly in all directions, bumping into one another, changing speed upon collision, some going fast and others going slowly. This situation is highly disordered.
The cause of the tendency of an isolated system toward disorder is easily explained. To do so, we distinguish between microstates and macrostates of a system. A
microstate is a particular description of the properties of the individual molecules
of the system. For example, the description we just gave of the velocity vectors of
the air molecules in your room being very ordered refers to a particular microstate, and the more likely likely haphazard motion is another microstate — one
that represents disorder. A macrostate is a description of the conditions of the system from a macroscopic point of view and makes use of macroscopic variables
such as pressure, density, and temperature. For example, in both of the microstates described for the air molecules in your room, the air molecules are distributed uniformly throughout the volume of the room; this uniform density distribution is a macrostate. We could not distinguish between our two microstates by
making a macroscopic measurement — both microstates would appear to be the
same macroscopically, and the two macrostates corresponding to these microstates
are equivalent.
For any given macrostate of the system, a number of microstates are possible,
or accessible. Among these microstates, it is assumed that all are equally probable.
However, when all possible microstates are examined, it is found that far more of
them are disordered than are ordered. Because all of the microstates are equally

687

22.6 Entropy

probable, it is highly likely that the actual macrostate is one resulting from one of
the highly disordered microstates, simply because there are many more of them.
Similarly, the probability of a macrostate’s forming from disordered microstates is
greater than the probability of a macrostate’s forming from ordered microstates.
All physical processes that take place in a system tend to cause the system and
its surroundings to move toward more probable macrostates. The more probable
macrostate is always one of greater disorder. If we consider a system and its surroundings to include the entire Universe, then the Universe is always moving toward a macrostate corresponding to greater disorder. Because entropy is a measure of disorder, an alternative way of stating this is the entropy of the Universe
increases in all real processes. This is yet another statement of the second law of
thermodynamics that can be shown to be equivalent to the Kelvin – Planck and
Clausius statements.
To calculate the change in entropy for a ﬁnite process, we must recognize that
T is generally not constant. If dQ r is the energy transferred by heat when the system is at a temperature T, then the change in entropy in an arbitrary reversible
process between an initial state and a ﬁnal state is

As with an inﬁnitesimal process, the change in entropy S of a system going from
one state to another has the same value for all paths connecting the two states.
That is, the ﬁnite change in entropy S of a system depends only on the properties
of the initial and ﬁnal equilibrium states. Thus, we are free to choose a particular
reversible path over which to evaluate the entropy in place of the actual path, as
long as the initial and ﬁnal states are the same for both paths.

Let us consider the changes in entropy that occur in a Carnot heat engine operating between the temperatures Tc and Th . In one cycle, the engine absorbs energy Q h from the hot reservoir and expels energy Q c to the cold reservoir. These
energy transfers occur only during the isothermal portions of the Carnot cycle;
thus, the constant temperature can be brought out in front of the integral sign in
Equation 22.9. The integral then simply has the value of the total amount of energy transferred by heat. Thus, the total change in entropy for one cycle is

Now let us consider a system taken through an arbitrary (non-Carnot) reversible cycle. Because entropy is a state function — and hence depends only on

Quasi-Static, Reversible Process for an Ideal Gas
Let us suppose that an ideal gas undergoes a quasi-static, reversible process from
an initial state having temperature Ti and volume Vi to a ﬁnal state described by Tf
and Vf . Let us calculate the change in entropy of the gas for this process.
Writing the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in differential form and rearranging
the terms, we have dQ r  dE int dW, where dW  P dV. For an ideal gas, recall
that dE int  nCV dT (Eq. 21.12), and from the ideal gas law, we have P  nRT/V.
Therefore, we can express the energy transferred by heat in the process as
dQ r  dE int

P dV  nCV dT

nRT

dV
V

We cannot integrate this expression as it stands because the last term contains two
variables, T and V. However, if we divide all terms by T, each of the terms on the
right-hand side depends on only one variable:
dQ r

This expression demonstrates mathematically what we argued earlier — that S depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states and is independent of the path between
the states. Also, note in Equation 22.12 that S can be positive or negative, depending on the values of the initial and ﬁnal volumes and temperatures. Finally,
for a cyclic process (Ti  Tf and Vi  Vf ), we see from Equation 22.12 that S  0.
This is evidence that entropy is a state function.

22.7 Entropy Changes in Irreversible Processes
Note that we are able to remove Tm from the integral because
the process is isothermal. Note also that S is positive. This
means that when a solid melts, its entropy increases because
the molecules are much more disordered in the liquid state
than they are in the solid state. The positive value for S also
means that the substance in its liquid state does not spontaneously transfer energy from itself to the surroundings and
freeze because to do so would involve a spontaneous decrease
in entropy.

Solution Let us assume an ice tray makes cubes that are
about 3 cm on a side. The volume per cube is then (very
roughly) 30 cm3. This much liquid water has a mass of 30 g.

ENTROPY CHANGES IN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES

By deﬁnition, calculation of the change in entropy requires information about a reversible path connecting the initial and ﬁnal equilibrium states. To calculate
changes in entropy for real (irreversible) processes, we must remember that entropy
(like internal energy) depends only on the state of the system. That is, entropy is a
state function. Hence, the change in entropy when a system moves between any two
equilibrium states depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states. We can show that if
this were not the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated.
We now calculate the entropy change in some irreversible process between two
equilibrium states by devising a reversible process (or series of reversible
processes) between the same two states and computing S  冕 dQ r /T for the reversible process. In irreversible processes, it is critically important that we distinguish between Q , the actual energy transfer in the process, and Q r , the energy
that would have been transferred by heat along a reversible path. Only Q r is the
correct value to be used in calculating the entropy change.
As we shall see in the following examples, the change in entropy for a system
and its surroundings is always positive for an irreversible process. In general, the
total entropy — and therefore the disorder — always increase in an irreversible
process. Keeping these considerations in mind, we can state the second law of
thermodynamics as follows:
The total entropy of an isolated system that undergoes a change can never decrease.
Furthermore, if the process is irreversible, then the total entropy of an isolated system always increases. In a reversible process, the total entropy of
an isolated system remains constant.
When dealing with a system that is not isolated from its surroundings, remember that the increase in entropy described in the second law is that of the system
and its surroundings. When a system and its surroundings interact in an irreversible process, the increase in entropy of one is greater than the decrease in entropy of the other. Hence, we conclude that the change in entropy of the Universe must be greater than zero for an irreversible process and equal to zero
for a reversible process. Ultimately, the entropy of the Universe should reach a
maximum value. At this value, the Universe will be in a state of uniform temperature and density. All physical, chemical, and biological processes will cease because
a state of perfect disorder implies that no energy is available for doing work. This
gloomy state of affairs is sometimes referred to as the heat death of the Universe.

Entropy Change in Thermal Conduction
Let us now consider a system consisting of a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir in
thermal contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe. A
process occurs during which energy Q is transferred by heat from the hot reservoir
at temperature Th to the cold reservoir at temperature Tc . Because the cold reservoir absorbs energy Q , its entropy increases by Q /Tc . At the same time, the hot
reservoir loses energy Q , and so its entropy change is  Q /Th . Because Th  Tc ,
the increase in entropy of the cold reservoir is greater than the decrease in entropy of the hot reservoir. Therefore, the change in entropy of the system (and of
the Universe) is greater than zero:

EXAMPLE 22.7

Solution We assume that, during the energy transfer, the
two objects do not undergo a temperature change. This is
not a necessary assumption; we make it only to avoid using integral calculus in our calculations. The process as described is
irreversible, and so we must ﬁnd an equivalent reversible
process. It is sufﬁcient to assume that the objects are connected by a poor thermal conductor whose temperature
spans the range from 273 K to 373 K. This conductor transfers energy slowly, and its state does not change during the
process. Under this assumption, the energy transfer to or
from each object is reversible, and we may set Q  Q r . The

We consider the two objects to be isolated from the rest of
the Universe. Thus, the entropy change of the Universe is just

that of our two-object system, which is
SU  Sc

Sh  0.007 9 J/K

This decrease in entropy of the Universe is in violation of the
second law. That is, the spontaneous transfer of energy
from a cold to a hot object cannot occur.
In terms of disorder, let us consider the violation of the
second law if energy were to continue to transfer spontaneously from a cold object to a hot object. Before the transfer, a certain degree of order is associated with the different
temperatures of the objects. The hot object’s molecules have
a higher average energy than the cold object’s molecules. If
energy spontaneously ﬂows from the cold object to the hot
object, then, over a period of time, the cold object will become colder and the hot object will become hotter. The difference in average molecular energy will become even
greater; this would represent an increase in order for the system and a violation of the second law.
In comparison, the process that does occur naturally is the
ﬂow of energy from the hot object to the cold object. In this
process, the difference in average molecular energy decreases; this represents a more random distribution of energy
and an increase in disorder.

Entropy Change in a Free Expansion
Let us again consider the adiabatic free expansion of a gas occupying an initial volume Vi (Fig. 22.16). A membrane separating the gas from an evacuated region is
broken, and the gas expands (irreversibly) to a volume Vf . Let us ﬁnd the changes
in entropy of the gas and of the Universe during this process.
The process is clearly neither reversible nor quasi-static. The work done by the
gas against the vacuum is zero, and because the walls are insulating, no energy is
transferred by heat during the expansion. That is, W 

temperature T2  T1 . The two substances are contained in a calorimeter so that
no energy is lost to the surroundings. The system of the two substances is allowed
to reach thermal equilibrium. What is the total entropy change for the system?
First, let us calculate the ﬁnal equilibrium temperature Tf . Using the techniques of Section 20.2 — namely, Equation 20.5, Q cold  Q hot , and Equation
20.4, Q  mc T, we obtain
m 1c 1 T1  m 2c 2 T2
m 1c 1(Tf  T1 )  m 2c 2(Tf  T2 )
Solving for Tf , we have
Tf 

m 1c 1T1

m 2c 2T2
m 2c 2

(22.14)

The process is irreversible because the system goes through a series of nonequilibrium states. During such a transformation, the temperature of the system at
any time is not well deﬁned because different parts of the system have different
temperatures. However, we can imagine that the hot substance at the initial temperature T2 is slowly cooled to the temperature Tf as it comes into contact with a
series of reservoirs differing inﬁnitesimally in temperature, the ﬁrst reservoir being
at T2 and the last being at Tf . Such a series of very small changes in temperature
would approximate a reversible process. We imagine doing the same thing for the
cold substance. Applying Equation 22.9 and noting that dQ  mc dT for an inﬁnitesimal change, we have

where Tf is given by Equation 22.14. If Equation 22.14 is substituted into Equation
22.15, we can show that one of the terms in Equation 22.15 is always positive and
the other is always negative. (You may want to verify this for yourself.) The positive
term is always greater than the negative term, and this results in a positive value for
S. Thus, we conclude that the entropy of the Universe increases in this irreversible process.
Finally, you should note that Equation 22.15 is valid only when no mixing of
different substances occurs, because a further entropy increase is associated with
the increase in disorder during the mixing. If the substances are liquids or gases
and mixing occurs, the result applies only if the two ﬂuids are identical, as in the
following example.

change in entropy of the system?

That is, as a result of this irreversible process, the increase in
entropy of the cold water is greater than the decrease in entropy of the warm water. Consequently, the increase in entropy of the system is 102 J/K.

ENTROPY ON A MICROSCOPIC SCALE 4

As we have seen, we can approach entropy by relying on macroscopic concepts
and using parameters such as pressure and temperature. We can also treat entropy
from a microscopic viewpoint through statistical analysis of molecular motions. We
now use a microscopic model to investigate once again the free expansion of an
ideal gas, which was discussed from a macroscopic point of view in the preceding
section.
In the kinetic theory of gases, gas molecules are represented as particles moving randomly. Let us suppose that the gas is initially conﬁned to a volume Vi , as
shown in Figure 22.17a. When the partition separating Vi from a larger container
is removed, the molecules eventually are distributed throughout the greater volume Vf (Fig. 22.17b). For a given uniform distribution of gas in the volume, there
are a large number of equivalent microstates, and we can relate the entropy of the
gas to the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate.
We count the number of microstates by considering the variety of molecular
locations involved in the free expansion. The instant after the partition is removed
(and before the molecules have had a chance to rush into the other half of the
container), all the molecules are in the initial volume. We assume that each molecule occupies some microscopic volume Vm . The total number of possible locations of a single molecule in a macroscopic initial volume Vi is the ratio
wi  Vi /Vm , which is a huge number. We use wi here to represent the number of
ways that the molecule can be placed in the volume, or the number of microstates,
which is equivalent to the number of available locations. We assume that the molecule’s occupying each of these locations is equally probable.
As more molecules are added to the system, the number of possible ways that
the molecules can be positioned in the volume multiplies. For example, in considering two molecules, for every possible placement of the ﬁrst, all possible placements of the second are available. Thus, there are w 1 ways of locating the ﬁrst molecule, and for each of these, there are w 2 ways of locating the second molecule.
The total number of ways of locating the two molecules is w 1 w 2 .
Neglecting the very small probability of having two molecules occupy the same
location, each molecule may go into any of the Vi /Vm locations, and so the number of ways of locating N molecules in the volume becomes W i  wiN  (Vi /Vm )N.
(Wi is not to be confused with work.) Similarly, when the volume is increased to
Vf , the number of ways of locating N molecules increases to W f  wf N (Vf /Vm )N.

Entropy (microscopic deﬁnition)

(22.18)

The more microstates there are that correspond to a given macrostate, the greater
is the entropy of that macrostate. As we have discussed previously, there are many
more disordered microstates than ordered microstates. Thus, Equation 22.18 indicates mathematically that entropy is a measure of microscopic disorder. Although in our discussion we used the speciﬁc example of the free expansion of an
ideal gas, a more rigorous development of the statistical interpretation of entropy
would lead us to the same conclusion.
Imagine the container of gas depicted in Figure 22.18a as having all of its molecules traveling at speeds greater than the mean value on the left side and all of its
molecules traveling at speeds less than the mean value on the right side (an ordered microstate). Compare this with the uniform mixture of fast- and slow-mov-

ﬁsh.
ing molecules in Figure 22.18b (a disordered microstate). You might expect the
ordered microstate to be very unlikely because random motions tend to mix the
slow- and fast-moving molecules uniformly. Yet individually each of these microstates is equally probable. However, there are far more disordered microstates
than ordered microstates, and so a macrostate corresponding to a large number of
equivalent disordered microstates is much more probable than a macrostate corresponding to a small number of equivalent ordered microstates.
Figure 22.19 shows a real-world example of this concept. There are two possible macrostates for the carnival game — winning a goldﬁsh and winning a black
ﬁsh. Because only one jar in the array of jars contains a black ﬁsh, only one possible microstate corresponds to the macrostate of winning a black ﬁsh. A large number of microstates are described by the coin’s falling into a jar containing a goldﬁsh. Thus, for the macrostate of winning a goldﬁsh, there are many equivalent
microstates. As a result, the probability of winning a goldﬁsh is much greater than
the probability of winning a black ﬁsh. If there are 24 goldﬁsh and 1 black ﬁsh, the
probability of winning the black ﬁsh is 1 in 25. This assumes that all microstates
have the same probability, a situation that may not be quite true for the situation
shown in Figure 22.19. If you are an accurate coin tosser and you are aiming for
the edge of the array of jars, then the probability of the coin’s landing in a jar near
the edge is likely to be greater than the probability of its landing in a jar near the
center.
Let us consider a similar type of probability problem for 100 molecules in a
container. At any given moment, the probability of one molecule’s being in the
left part of the container shown in Figure 22.20a as a result of random motion is 21.
If there are two molecules, as shown in Figure 22.20b, the probability of both being in the left part is (21)2 or 1 in 4. If there are three molecules (Fig. 22.20c), the
probability of all of them being in the left portion at the same moment is (21)3, or 1
in 8. For 100 independently moving molecules, the probability that the 50 fastest
ones will be found in the left part at any moment is (21)50. Likewise, the probability
that the remaining 50 slower molecules will be found in the right part at any moment is (12)50. Therefore, the probability of ﬁnding this fast-slow separation
as a result of random motion is the product (12 )50(12 )50  (12 )100, which corresponds to about 1 in 1030. When this calculation is extrapolated from 100 molecules to the number in 1 mol of gas (6.02  1023), the ordered arrangement is
found to be extremely improbable!

shown in Table 22.1. As this table indicates, there is only one
way to draw four red marbles, and so there is only one microstate. However, there are four possible microstates that
correspond to the macrostate of one green marble and three
red marbles; six microstates that correspond to two green
marbles and two red marbles; four microstates that corre-

SUMMARY
A heat engine is a device that converts internal energy to other useful forms of
energy. The net work done by a heat engine in carrying a working substance
through a cyclic process (E int  0) is
W  Qh  Qc

(22.1)

where Q h is the energy absorbed from a hot reservoir and Q c is the energy expelled to a cold reservoir.
The thermal efﬁciency e of a heat engine is

W
Qc

Qh
Qh

(22.2)

The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in the following two ways:
• It is impossible to construct a heat engine that, operating in a cycle, produces

no effect other than the absorption of energy from a reservoir and the performance of an equal amount of work (the Kelvin – Planck statement).
• It is impossible to construct a cyclic machine whose sole effect is the continuous
transfer of energy from one object to another object at a higher temperature
without the input of energy by work (the Clausius statement).
In a reversible process, the system can be returned to its initial conditions
along the same path shown on a PV diagram, and every point along this path is an
equilibrium state. A process that does not satisfy these requirements is irreversible. Carnot’s theorem states that no real heat engine operating (irreversibly) between the temperatures Tc and Th can be more efﬁcient than an engine operating reversibly in a Carnot cycle between the same two temperatures.
The thermal efﬁciency of a heat engine operating in the Carnot cycle is

CHAPTER 22

Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

You should be able to use this equation (or an equivalent form involving a ratio of
heats) to determine the maximum possible efﬁciency of any heat engine.
The second law of thermodynamics states that when real (irreversible)
processes occur, the degree of disorder in the system plus the surroundings increases. When a process occurs in an isolated system, the state of the system becomes more disordered. The measure of disorder in a system is called entropy S.
Thus, another way in which the second law can be stated is
• The entropy of the Universe increases in all real processes.

The change in entropy dS of a system during a process between two inﬁnitesimally separated equilibrium states is
dQ r
T

dS 

(22.8)

where dQ r is the energy transfer by heat for a reversible process that connects the
initial and ﬁnal states. The change in entropy of a system during an arbitrary
process between an initial state and a ﬁnal state is
S 

冕

f

i

dQ r
T

(22.9)

The value of S for the system is the same for all paths connecting the initial and
ﬁnal states. The change in entropy for a system undergoing any reversible, cyclic
process is zero, and when such a process occurs, the entropy of the Universe remains constant.
From a microscopic viewpoint, entropy is deﬁned as
S ⬅ k B ln W

(22.18)

where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and W is the number of microstates available to
the system for the existing macrostate. Because of the statistical tendency of systems to proceed toward states of greater probability and greater disorder, all natural processes are irreversible, and entropy increases. Thus, entropy is a measure
of microscopic disorder.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
22.1 The cost of heating your home decreases to 25% of the
original cost. With electric heating, you receive the same
amount of energy for heating your home as enters it by
electricity. The COP of 4 for the heat pump means that
you are receiving four times as much energy as the energy entering by electricity. With four times as much energy per unit of energy from electricity, you need only
one-fourth as much electricity.
22.2 (b) Because the process is reversible and adiabatic,
Q r  0; therefore, S  0.

22.3 False. The second law states that the entropy of the Universe increases in real processes. Although the organization of molecules into ordered leaves and branches represents a decrease in entropy of the tree, this organization
takes place because of a number of processes in which
the tree interacts with its surroundings. If we include the
entropy changes associated with all these processes, the
entropy change of the Universe during the growth of a
tree is still positive.

he electromagnetic force between charged particles is one of the fundamental forces of nature. We begin this chapter by describing some of the basic
properties of electric forces. We then discuss Coulomb’s law, which is the fundamental law governing the force between any two charged particles. Next, we introduce the concept of an electric ﬁeld associated with a charge distribution and
describe its effect on other charged particles. We then show how to use
Coulomb’s law to calculate the electric ﬁeld for a given charge distribution. We
conclude the chapter with a discussion of the motion of a charged particle in a
uniform electric ﬁeld.

PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC CHARGES

A number of simple experiments demonstrate the existence of electric forces and
charges. For example, after running a comb through your hair on a dry day, you
will ﬁnd that the comb attracts bits of paper. The attractive force is often strong
enough to suspend the paper. The same effect occurs when materials such as glass
or rubber are rubbed with silk or fur.
Another simple experiment is to rub an inﬂated balloon with wool. The balloon then adheres to a wall, often for hours. When materials behave in this way,
they are said to be electriﬁed, or to have become electrically charged. You can easily electrify your body by vigorously rubbing your shoes on a wool rug. The electric
charge on your body can be felt and removed by lightly touching (and startling) a
friend. Under the right conditions, you will see a spark when you touch, and both
of you will feel a slight tingle. (Experiments such as these work best on a dry day
because an excessive amount of moisture in the air can cause any charge you build
up to “leak” from your body to the Earth.)
In a series of simple experiments, it is found that there are two kinds of electric charges, which were given the names positive and negative by Benjamin
Franklin (1706 – 1790). To verify that this is true, consider a hard rubber rod that
has been rubbed with fur and then suspended by a nonmetallic thread, as shown
in Figure 23.1. When a glass rod that has been rubbed with silk is brought near the
rubber rod, the two attract each other (Fig. 23.1a). On the other hand, if two
charged rubber rods (or two charged glass rods) are brought near each other, as
shown in Figure 23.1b, the two repel each other. This observation shows that the
rubber and glass are in two different states of electriﬁcation. On the basis of these
observations, we conclude that like charges repel one another and unlike
charges attract one another.
Using the convention suggested by Franklin, the electric charge on the glass
rod is called positive and that on the rubber rod is called negative. Therefore, any
charged object attracted to a charged rubber rod (or repelled by a charged glass
rod) must have a positive charge, and any charged object repelled by a charged
rubber rod (or attracted to a charged glass rod) must have a negative charge.
Attractive electric forces are responsible for the behavior of a wide variety of
commercial products. For example, the plastic in many contact lenses, etaﬁlcon, is
made up of molecules that electrically attract the protein molecules in human
tears. These protein molecules are absorbed and held by the plastic so that the
lens ends up being primarily composed of the wearer’s tears. Because of this, the
wearer’s eye does not treat the lens as a foreign object, and it can be worn comfortably. Many cosmetics also take advantage of electric forces by incorporating
materials that are electrically attracted to skin or hair, causing the pigments or
other chemicals to stay put once they are applied.

Charge is conserved

Another important aspect of Franklin’s model of electricity is the implication
that electric charge is always conserved. That is, when one object is rubbed
against another, charge is not created in the process. The electriﬁed state is due to
a transfer of charge from one object to the other. One object gains some amount of
negative charge while the other gains an equal amount of positive charge. For example, when a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the silk obtains a negative charge that
is equal in magnitude to the positive charge on the glass rod. We now know from
our understanding of atomic structure that negatively charged electrons are transferred from the glass to the silk in the rubbing process. Similarly, when rubber is
rubbed with fur, electrons are transferred from the fur to the rubber, giving the
rubber a net negative charge and the fur a net positive charge. This process is consistent with the fact that neutral, uncharged matter contains as many positive
charges (protons within atomic nuclei) as negative charges (electrons).

Quick Quiz 23.1
If you rub an inﬂated balloon against your hair, the two materials attract each other, as
shown in Figure 23.2. Is the amount of charge present in the balloon and your hair after
rubbing (a) less than, (b) the same as, or (c) more than the amount of charge present before rubbing?

Figure 23.2 Rubbing a balloon
against your hair on a dry day
causes the balloon and your hair
to become charged.

Charge is quantized

In 1909, Robert Millikan (1868 – 1953) discovered that electric charge always
occurs as some integral multiple of a fundamental amount of charge e. In modern
terms, the electric charge q is said to be quantized, where q is the standard symbol
used for charge. That is, electric charge exists as discrete “packets,” and we can
write q ⫽ Ne, where N is some integer. Other experiments in the same period
showed that the electron has a charge ⫺e and the proton has a charge of equal
magnitude but opposite sign ⫹e. Some particles, such as the neutron, have no
charge. A neutral atom must contain as many protons as electrons.
Because charge is a conserved quantity, the net charge in a closed region remains the same. If charged particles are created in some process, they are always
created in pairs whose members have equal-magnitude charges of opposite sign.

23.2 Insulators and Conductors

From our discussion thus far, we conclude that electric charge has the following important properties:
• Two kinds of charges occur in nature, with the property that unlike charges

attract one another and like charges repel one another.
• Charge is conserved.
• Charge is quantized.

INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS

It is convenient to classify substances in terms of their ability to conduct electric
charge:
Electrical conductors are materials in which electric charges move freely,
whereas electrical insulators are materials in which electric charges cannot
move freely.
Materials such as glass, rubber, and wood fall into the category of electrical insulators. When such materials are charged by rubbing, only the area rubbed becomes
charged, and the charge is unable to move to other regions of the material.
In contrast, materials such as copper, aluminum, and silver are good electrical
conductors. When such materials are charged in some small region, the charge
readily distributes itself over the entire surface of the material. If you hold a copper rod in your hand and rub it with wool or fur, it will not attract a small piece of
paper. This might suggest that a metal cannot be charged. However, if you attach a
wooden handle to the rod and then hold it by that handle as you rub the rod, the
rod will remain charged and attract the piece of paper. The explanation for this is
as follows: Without the insulating wood, the electric charges produced by rubbing
readily move from the copper through your body and into the Earth. The insulating wooden handle prevents the ﬂow of charge into your hand.
Semiconductors are a third class of materials, and their electrical properties
are somewhere between those of insulators and those of conductors. Silicon and
germanium are well-known examples of semiconductors commonly used in the
fabrication of a variety of electronic devices, such as transistors and light-emitting
diodes. The electrical properties of semiconductors can be changed over many orders of magnitude by the addition of controlled amounts of certain atoms to the
materials.
When a conductor is connected to the Earth by means of a conducting wire or
pipe, it is said to be grounded. The Earth can then be considered an inﬁnite
“sink” to which electric charges can easily migrate. With this in mind, we can understand how to charge a conductor by a process known as induction.
To understand induction, consider a neutral (uncharged) conducting sphere
insulated from ground, as shown in Figure 23.3a. When a negatively charged rubber rod is brought near the sphere, the region of the sphere nearest the rod obtains an excess of positive charge while the region farthest from the rod obtains an
equal excess of negative charge, as shown in Figure 23.3b. (That is, electrons in
the region nearest the rod migrate to the opposite side of the sphere. This occurs
even if the rod never actually touches the sphere.) If the same experiment is performed with a conducting wire connected from the sphere to ground (Fig. 23.3c),
some of the electrons in the conductor are so strongly repelled by the presence of

the negative charge in the rod that they move out of the sphere through the
ground wire and into the Earth. If the wire to ground is then removed (Fig.
23.3d), the conducting sphere contains an excess of induced positive charge. When
the rubber rod is removed from the vicinity of the sphere (Fig. 23.3e), this induced positive charge remains on the ungrounded sphere. Note that the charge
remaining on the sphere is uniformly distributed over its surface because of the repulsive forces among the like charges. Also note that the rubber rod loses none of
its negative charge during this process.
Charging an object by induction requires no contact with the body inducing
the charge. This is in contrast to charging an object by rubbing (that is, by conduction), which does require contact between the two objects.
A process similar to induction in conductors takes place in insulators. In most
neutral molecules, the center of positive charge coincides with the center of negative charge. However, in the presence of a charged object, these centers inside
each molecule in an insulator may shift slightly, resulting in more positive charge
on one side of the molecule than on the other. This realignment of charge within
individual molecules produces an induced charge on the surface of the insulator,
as shown in Figure 23.4. Knowing about induction in insulators, you should be
able to explain why a comb that has been rubbed through hair attracts bits of electrically neutral paper and why a balloon that has been rubbed against your clothing is able to stick to an electrically neutral wall.

Coulomb conﬁrmed that the electric force between two small charged spheres is
proportional to the inverse square of their separation distance r — that is,
F e ⬀ 1/r 2. The operating principle of the torsion balance is the same as that of the
apparatus used by Cavendish to measure the gravitational constant (see Section
14.2), with the electrically neutral spheres replaced by charged ones. The electric
force between charged spheres A and B in Figure 23.5 causes the spheres to either
attract or repel each other, and the resulting motion causes the suspended ﬁber to
twist. Because the restoring torque of the twisted ﬁber is proportional to the angle
through which the ﬁber rotates, a measurement of this angle provides a quantitative measure of the electric force of attraction or repulsion. Once the spheres are
charged by rubbing, the electric force between them is very large compared with
the gravitational attraction, and so the gravitational force can be neglected.
Coulomb’s experiments showed that the electric force between two stationary
charged particles
• is inversely proportional to the square of the separation r between the particles

and directed along the line joining them;
• is proportional to the product of the charges q 1 and q 2 on the two particles;
• is attractive if the charges are of opposite sign and repulsive if the charges have

the same sign.

B

From these observations, we can express Coulomb’s law as an equation giving
the magnitude of the electric force (sometimes called the Coulomb force) between
two point charges:

an uncertainty of a few parts in 1016.

q 2 ⫽ ⫺2.0 ␮C, and a ⫽ 0.10 m. Find the resultant force exerted on q 3 .

Solution

First, note the direction of the individual forces
exerted by q 1 and q 2 on q 3 . The force F23 exerted by q 2 on q 3
is attractive because q 2 and q 3 have opposite signs. The force
F13 exerted by q 1 on q 3 is repulsive because both charges are
positive.

Three point charges lie along the x axis as shown in Figure
23.8. The positive charge q 1 ⫽ 15.0 ␮ C is at x ⫽ 2.00 m, the
positive charge q 2 ⫽ 6.00 ␮ C is at the origin, and the resultant force acting on q 3 is zero. What is the x coordinate of q 3?

(4.00 ⫺ 4.00x ⫹ x 2 )(6.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺6 C) ⫽ x 2(15.0 ⫻ 10 ⫺6 C)
Solving this quadratic equation for x, we ﬁnd that
x ⫽ 0.775 m. Why is the negative root not acceptable?

Solution

Because q 3 is negative and q 1 and q 2 are positive,
the forces F13 and F23 are both attractive, as indicated in Figure 23.8. From Coulomb’s law, F13 and F23 have magnitudes

For this experiment you need two 20-cm strips of transparent tape (mass of each ⬇ 65 mg). Fold about
1 cm of tape over at one end of each strip to create a handle. Press both pieces of tape side by side onto
a table top, rubbing your ﬁnger back and forth across the strips. Quickly pull the strips off the surface
so that they become charged. Hold the tape handles together and the strips will repel each other, forming an inverted “V” shape. Measure the angle between the pieces, and estimate the excess charge on
each strip. Assume that the charges act as if they were located at the center of mass of each strip.

THE ELECTRIC FIELD

Two ﬁeld forces have been introduced into our discussions so far — the gravitational force and the electric force. As pointed out earlier, ﬁeld forces can act
through space, producing an effect even when no physical contact between the objects occurs. The gravitational ﬁeld g at a point in space was deﬁned in Section
14.6 to be equal to the gravitational force Fg acting on a test particle of mass m divided by that mass: g ⬅ Fg /m. A similar approach to electric forces was developed
by Michael Faraday and is of such practical value that we shall devote much attention to it in the next several chapters. In this approach, an electric ﬁeld is said to
exist in the region of space around a charged object. When another charged object enters this electric ﬁeld, an electric force acts on it. As an example, consider
Figure 23.10, which shows a small positive test charge q 0 placed near a second object carrying a much greater positive charge Q. We deﬁne the strength (in other
words, the magnitude) of the electric ﬁeld at the location of the test charge to be
the electric force per unit charge, or to be more speciﬁc

719

23.4 The Electric Field

the electric ﬁeld E at a point in space is deﬁned as the electric force Fe acting
on a positive test charge q 0 placed at that point divided by the magnitude of the
test charge:

Fe
q0

(23.3)

Note that E is the ﬁeld produced by some charge external to the test charge — it is
not the ﬁeld produced by the test charge itself. Also, note that the existence of an
electric ﬁeld is a property of its source. For example, every electron comes with its
own electric ﬁeld.
The vector E has the SI units of newtons per coulomb (N/C), and, as Figure
23.10 shows, its direction is the direction of the force a positive test charge experiences when placed in the ﬁeld. We say that an electric ﬁeld exists at a point if a
test charge at rest at that point experiences an electric force. Once the magnitude and direction of the electric ﬁeld are known at some point, the electric
force exerted on any charged particle placed at that point can be calculated from

Equation 23.3. Furthermore, the electric ﬁeld is said to exist at some point (even
empty space) regardless of whether a test charge is located at that point.
(This is analogous to the gravitational ﬁeld set up by any object, which is said to
exist at a given point regardless of whether some other object is present at that
point to “feel” the ﬁeld.) The electric ﬁeld magnitudes for various ﬁeld sources
are given in Table 23.2.
When using Equation 23.3, we must assume that the test charge q 0 is small
enough that it does not disturb the charge distribution responsible for the electric
ﬁeld. If a vanishingly small test charge q 0 is placed near a uniformly charged metallic sphere, as shown in Figure 23.11a, the charge on the metallic sphere, which
produces the electric ﬁeld, remains uniformly distributed. If the test charge is
great enough (q⬘0 W q 0 ), as shown in Figure 23.11b, the charge on the metallic
sphere is redistributed and the ratio of the force to the test charge is different:
(Fe⬘/q⬘0 ⫽ F e /q 0). That is, because of this redistribution of charge on the metallic
sphere, the electric ﬁeld it sets up is different from the ﬁeld it sets up in the presence of the much smaller q 0.
To determine the direction of an electric ﬁeld, consider a point charge q located a distance r from a test charge q 0 located at a point P, as shown in Figure
23.12. According to Coulomb’s law, the force exerted by q on the test charge is
Fe ⫽ k e

r̂
r2

where r̂ is a unit vector directed from q toward q 0. Because the electric ﬁeld at P,
the position of the test charge, is deﬁned by E ⫽ Fe /q 0 , we ﬁnd that at P, the electric ﬁeld created by q is
q
E ⫽ k e 2 r̂
(23.4)
r
If q is positive, as it is in Figure 23.12a, the electric ﬁeld is directed radially outward
from it. If q is negative, as it is in Figure 23.12b, the ﬁeld is directed toward it.
To calculate the electric ﬁeld at a point P due to a group of point charges, we
ﬁrst calculate the electric ﬁeld vectors at P individually using Equation 23.4 and
then add them vectorially. In other words,
at any point P, the total electric ﬁeld due to a group of charges equals the vector sum of the electric ﬁelds of the individual charges.
This superposition principle applied to ﬁelds follows directly from the superposition property of electric forces. Thus, the electric ﬁeld of a group of charges can

Electric Field of a Dipole

An electric dipole is deﬁned as a positive charge q and a
negative charge ⫺ q separated by some distance. For the dipole shown in Figure 23.14, ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld E at P due
to the charges, where P is a distance y W a from the origin.

Solution At P, the ﬁelds E1 and E2 due to the two charges
are equal in magnitude because P is equidistant from the
charges. The total ﬁeld is E ⫽ E 1 ⫹ E 2 , where

variation in E for the dipole also is obtained for a distant
point along the x axis (see Problem 21) and for any general
distant point.
The electric dipole is a good model of many molecules,
such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). As we shall see in later
chapters, neutral atoms and molecules behave as dipoles
when placed in an external electric ﬁeld. Furthermore, many
molecules, such as HCl, are permanent dipoles. The effect of
such dipoles on the behavior of materials subjected to electric ﬁelds is discussed in Chapter 26.
y

The y components of E1 and E2 cancel each other, and the
x components add because they are both in the positive
x direction. Therefore, E is parallel to the x axis and has a
magnitude equal to 2E1 cos ␪. From Figure 23.14 we see that
cos ␪ ⫽ a /r ⫽ a /(y 2 ⫹ a 2 )1/2. Therefore,

Thus, we see that, at distances far from a dipole but along the

the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld created by the dipole
varies as 1/r 3, whereas the more slowly varying ﬁeld of a
point charge varies as 1/r 2 (see Eq. 23.4). This is because at
distant points, the ﬁelds of the two charges of equal magnitude and opposite sign almost cancel each other. The 1/r 3

and E 2 is the ﬁeld due to the negative charge ⫺q.

ELECTRIC FIELD OF A CONTINUOUS
CHARGE DISTRIBUTION

Very often the distances between charges in a group of charges are much smaller
than the distance from the group to some point of interest (for example, a point
where the electric ﬁeld is to be calculated). In such situations, the system of

723

23.5 Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution

charges is smeared out, or continuous. That is, the system of closely spaced charges
is equivalent to a total charge that is continuously distributed along some line,
over some surface, or throughout some volume.
To evaluate the electric ﬁeld created by a continuous charge distribution, we
use the following procedure: First, we divide the charge distribution into small elements, each of which contains a small charge ⌬q, as shown in Figure 23.15. Next,
we use Equation 23.4 to calculate the electric ﬁeld due to one of these elements at
a point P. Finally, we evaluate the total ﬁeld at P due to the charge distribution by
summing the contributions of all the charge elements (that is, by applying the superposition principle).
The electric ﬁeld at P due to one element carrying charge ⌬q is

charge density along with the following notations:

axis, that dx is the length of one small segment, and that dq is
the charge on that segment. Because the rod has a charge
per unit length ␭, the charge dq on the small segment is
dq ⫽ ␭ dx.
The ﬁeld d E due to this segment at P is in the negative x

charge Q ), and its magnitude is

Because every other element also produces a ﬁeld in the negative x direction, the problem of summing their contributions is particularly simple in this case. The total ﬁeld at P

It is important that you understand how to carry out integrations such as this. First, express the
charge element dq in terms of the other variables in the integral (in this example, there is one variable,
x, and so we made the change dq ⫽ ␭ dx). The integral must be over scalar quantities; therefore, you
must express the electric ﬁeld in terms of components, if necessary. (In this example the ﬁeld has only
an x component, so we do not bother with this detail.) Then, reduce your expression to an integral
over a single variable (or to multiple integrals, each over a single variable). In examples that have
spherical or cylindrical symmetry, the single variable will be a radial coordinate.

EXAMPLE 23.9

The Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Disk

A disk of radius R has a uniform surface charge density ␴.
Calculate the electric ﬁeld at a point P that lies along the central perpendicular axis of the disk and a distance x from the
center of the disk (Fig. 23.18).

Solution If we consider the disk as a set of concentric
rings, we can use our result from Example 23.8 — which gives
the ﬁeld created by a ring of radius a — and sum the contri-

butions of all rings making up the disk. By symmetry, the ﬁeld
at an axial point must be along the central axis.
The ring of radius r and width dr shown in Figure 23.18
has a surface area equal to 2␲r dr. The charge dq on this ring
is equal to the area of the ring multiplied by the surface
charge density: dq ⫽ 2␲␴r dr. Using this result in the equation given for E x in Example 23.8 (with a replaced by r), we

ELECTRIC FIELD LINES

A convenient way of visualizing electric ﬁeld patterns is to draw lines that follow
the same direction as the electric ﬁeld vector at any point. These lines, called electric ﬁeld lines, are related to the electric ﬁeld in any region of space in the following manner:
• The electric ﬁeld vector E is tangent to the electric ﬁeld line at each point.
• The number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines

is proportional to the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in that region. Thus, E is
great when the ﬁeld lines are close together and small when they are far apart.

A

B

Figure 23.19 Electric ﬁeld lines
penetrating two surfaces. The magnitude of the ﬁeld is greater on surface A than on surface B.

These properties are illustrated in Figure 23.19. The density of lines through
surface A is greater than the density of lines through surface B. Therefore, the
electric ﬁeld is more intense on surface A than on surface B. Furthermore, the fact
that the lines at different locations point in different directions indicates that the
ﬁeld is nonuniform.
Representative electric ﬁeld lines for the ﬁeld due to a single positive point
charge are shown in Figure 23.20a. Note that in this two-dimensional drawing we
show only the ﬁeld lines that lie in the plane containing the point charge. The
lines are actually directed radially outward from the charge in all directions; thus,
instead of the ﬂat “wheel” of lines shown, you should picture an entire sphere of
lines. Because a positive test charge placed in this ﬁeld would be repelled by the
positive point charge, the lines are directed radially away from the positive point

charge. The electric ﬁeld lines representing the ﬁeld due to a single negative point
charge are directed toward the charge (Fig. 23.20b). In either case, the lines are
along the radial direction and extend all the way to inﬁnity. Note that the lines become closer together as they approach the charge; this indicates that the strength
of the ﬁeld increases as we move toward the source charge.
The rules for drawing electric ﬁeld lines are as follows:
• The lines must begin on a positive charge and terminate on a negative

charge.
• The number of lines drawn leaving a positive charge or approaching a nega-

tive charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge.

Rules for drawing electric ﬁeld
lines

• No two ﬁeld lines can cross.

Is this visualization of the electric ﬁeld in terms of ﬁeld lines consistent with
Equation 23.4, the expression we obtained for E using Coulomb’s law? To answer
this question, consider an imaginary spherical surface of radius r concentric with a
point charge. From symmetry, we see that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is the
same everywhere on the surface of the sphere. The number of lines N that emerge
from the charge is equal to the number that penetrate the spherical surface.
Hence, the number of lines per unit area on the sphere is N/4␲ r 2 (where the surface area of the sphere is 4␲ r 2 ). Because E is proportional to the number of lines
per unit area, we see that E varies as 1/r 2; this ﬁnding is consistent with Equation
23.4.
As we have seen, we use electric ﬁeld lines to qualitatively describe the electric
ﬁeld. One problem with this model is that we always draw a ﬁnite number of lines
from (or to) each charge. Thus, it appears as if the ﬁeld acts only in certain directions; this is not true. Instead, the ﬁeld is continuous — that is, it exists at every
point. Another problem associated with this model is the danger of gaining the
wrong impression from a two-dimensional drawing of ﬁeld lines being used to describe a three-dimensional situation. Be aware of these shortcomings every time
you either draw or look at a diagram showing electric ﬁeld lines.
We choose the number of ﬁeld lines starting from any positively charged object to be C⬘q and the number of lines ending on any negatively charged object to
be C⬘兩 q 兩, where C⬘ is an arbitrary proportionality constant. Once C⬘ is chosen, the
number of lines is ﬁxed. For example, if object 1 has charge Q 1 and object 2 has
charge Q 2 , then the ratio of number of lines is N 2 /N 1 ⫽ Q 2/Q 1 .
The electric ﬁeld lines for two point charges of equal magnitude but opposite
signs (an electric dipole) are shown in Figure 23.21. Because the charges are of
equal magnitude, the number of lines that begin at the positive charge must equal
the number that terminate at the negative charge. At points very near the charges,
the lines are nearly radial. The high density of lines between the charges indicates
a region of strong electric ﬁeld.
Figure 23.22 shows the electric ﬁeld lines in the vicinity of two equal positive
point charges. Again, the lines are nearly radial at points close to either charge,
and the same number of lines emerge from each charge because the charges are
equal in magnitude. At great distances from the charges, the ﬁeld is approximately
equal to that of a single point charge of magnitude 2q.
Finally, in Figure 23.23 we sketch the electric ﬁeld lines associated with a positive charge ⫹ 2q and a negative charge ⫺q. In this case, the number of lines leaving ⫹ 2q is twice the number terminating at ⫺q. Hence, only half of the lines that
leave the positive charge reach the negative charge. The remaining half terminate

MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLES IN A
UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD

When a particle of charge q and mass m is placed in an electric ﬁeld E, the electric
force exerted on the charge is qE. If this is the only force exerted on the particle,
it must be the net force and so must cause the particle to accelerate. In this case,
Newton’s second law applied to the particle gives
Fe ⫽ qE ⫽ ma
The acceleration of the particle is therefore
a⫽

qE
m

(23.7)

If E is uniform (that is, constant in magnitude and direction), then the acceleration is constant. If the particle has a positive charge, then its acceleration is in the
direction of the electric ﬁeld. If the particle has a negative charge, then its acceleration is in the direction opposite the electric ﬁeld.

EXAMPLE 23.10

An Accelerating Positive Charge

uniform electric ﬁeld E directed along the x axis, as shown in
Figure 23.24. Describe its motion.

qE/m. The motion is simple linear motion along the x axis.
Therefore, we can apply the equations of kinematics in one

Note that we have neglected the gravitational force acting on the electron.
This is a good approximation when we are dealing with atomic particles. For an
electric ﬁeld of 104 N/C, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force eE to the
magnitude of the gravitational force mg is of the order of 1014 for an electron and

The Cathode Ray Tube
The example we just worked describes a portion of a cathode ray tube (CRT). This
tube, illustrated in Figure 23.26, is commonly used to obtain a visual display of
electronic information in oscilloscopes, radar systems, television receivers, and
computer monitors. The CRT is a vacuum tube in which a beam of electrons is accelerated and deﬂected under the inﬂuence of electric or magnetic ﬁelds. The
electron beam is produced by an assembly called an electron gun located in the
neck of the tube. These electrons, if left undisturbed, travel in a straight-line path
until they strike the front of the CRT, the “screen,” which is coated with a material
that emits visible light when bombarded with electrons.
In an oscilloscope, the electrons are deﬂected in various directions by two sets
of plates placed at right angles to each other in the neck of the tube. (A television

CRT steers the beam with a magnetic ﬁeld, as discussed in Chapter 29.) An external electric circuit is used to control the amount of charge present on the plates.
The placing of positive charge on one horizontal plate and negative charge on the
other creates an electric ﬁeld between the plates and allows the beam to be
steered from side to side. The vertical deﬂection plates act in the same way, except
that changing the charge on them deﬂects the beam vertically.

SUMMARY
Electric charges have the following important properties:
• Unlike charges attract one another, and like charges repel one another.
• Charge is conserved.
• Charge is quantized — that is, it exists in discrete packets that are some integral

multiple of the electronic charge.
Conductors are materials in which charges move freely. Insulators are materials in which charges do not move freely.

Problem-Solving Hints
Finding the Electric Field
• Units: In calculations using the Coulomb constant k e (⫽1/4␲⑀0 ), charges
must be expressed in coulombs and distances in meters.
• Calculating the electric ﬁeld of point charges: To ﬁnd the total electric
ﬁeld at a given point, ﬁrst calculate the electric ﬁeld at the point due to
each individual charge. The resultant ﬁeld at the point is the vector sum of
the ﬁelds due to the individual charges.
• Continuous charge distributions: When you are confronted with problems that involve a continuous distribution of charge, the vector sums for
evaluating the total electric ﬁeld at some point must be replaced by vector
integrals. Divide the charge distribution into inﬁnitesimal pieces, and calculate the vector sum by integrating over the entire charge distribution. You
should review Examples 23.7 through 23.9.
• Symmetry: With both distributions of point charges and continuous
charge distributions, take advantage of any symmetry in the system to simplify your calculations.

n the preceding chapter we showed how to use Coulomb’s law to calculate the
electric ﬁeld generated by a given charge distribution. In this chapter, we describe Gauss’s law and an alternative procedure for calculating electric ﬁelds.
The law is based on the fact that the fundamental electrostatic force between point
charges exhibits an inverse-square behavior. Although a consequence of
Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law is more convenient for calculating the electric ﬁelds of
highly symmetric charge distributions and makes possible useful qualitative reasoning when we are dealing with complicated problems.

24.1

penetrating a plane of area A perpendicular to the ﬁeld. The electric
ﬂux ⌽E through this area is equal
to EA.

ELECTRIC FLUX

The concept of electric ﬁeld lines is described qualitatively in Chapter 23. We now
use the concept of electric ﬂux to treat electric ﬁeld lines in a more quantitative
way.
Consider an electric ﬁeld that is uniform in both magnitude and direction, as
shown in Figure 24.1. The ﬁeld lines penetrate a rectangular surface of area A,
which is perpendicular to the ﬁeld. Recall from Section 23.6 that the number of
lines per unit area (in other words, the line density) is proportional to the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld. Therefore, the total number of lines penetrating the surface is proportional to the product EA. This product of the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld E and surface area A perpendicular to the ﬁeld is called the electric ﬂux
⌽E (uppercase Greek phi):
⌽E ⫽ EA

(24.1)

From the SI units of E and A, we see that ⌽E has units of newton – meters squared
per coulomb (N⭈m2/C). Electric ﬂux is proportional to the number of electric ﬁeld lines penetrating some surface.

EXAMPLE 24.1

Flux Through a Sphere

What is the electric ﬂux through a sphere that has a radius of
1.00 m and carries a charge of ⫹ 1.00 ␮C at its center?

perpendicular to the surface of the sphere. The ﬂux through
the sphere (whose surface area A ⫽ 4␲r 2 ⫽ 12.6 m2 ) is thus
⌽E ⫽ EA ⫽ (8.99 ⫻ 10 3 N/C)(12.6 m2 )

this charge is given by Equation 23.4,

Answer

(a) 3.60 ⫻ 10 4 N/C; (b) 1.13 ⫻ 10 5 N⭈m2/C.

If the surface under consideration is not perpendicular to the ﬁeld, the ﬂux
through it must be less than that given by Equation 24.1. We can understand this
by considering Figure 24.2, in which the normal to the surface of area A is at an
angle ␪ to the uniform electric ﬁeld. Note that the number of lines that cross this
area A is equal to the number that cross the area A⬘, which is a projection of area A
aligned perpendicular to the ﬁeld. From Figure 24.2 we see that the two areas are
related by A⬘ ⫽ A cos ␪. Because the ﬂux through A equals the ﬂux through A⬘, we

Field lines representing a

Because the number of lines that go

through A⬘ is equal to the ﬂux through
A and is given by ⌽ E ⫽ EA cos ␪ .

Shine a desk lamp onto a playing
card and notice how the size of the
shadow on your desk depends on the
orientation of the card with respect
to the beam of light. Could a formula
like Equation 24.2 be used to describe how much light was being
blocked by the card?

conclude that the ﬂux through A is
⌽E ⫽ EA⬘ ⫽ EA cos ␪

(24.2)

From this result, we see that the ﬂux through a surface of ﬁxed area A has a maximum value EA when the surface is perpendicular to the ﬁeld (in other words,
when the normal to the surface is parallel to the ﬁeld, that is, ␪ ⫽ 0⬚ in Figure
24.2); the ﬂux is zero when the surface is parallel to the ﬁeld (in other words,
when the normal to the surface is perpendicular to the ﬁeld, that is, ␪ ⫽ 90⬚).
We assumed a uniform electric ﬁeld in the preceding discussion. In more general situations, the electric ﬁeld may vary over a surface. Therefore, our deﬁnition
of ﬂux given by Equation 24.2 has meaning only over a small element of area.
Consider a general surface divided up into a large number of small elements, each
of area ⌬A. The variation in the electric ﬁeld over one element can be neglected if
the element is sufﬁciently small. It is convenient to deﬁne a vector ⌬A i whose magnitude represents the area of the ith element of the surface and whose direction is
deﬁned to be perpendicular to the surface element, as shown in Figure 24.3. The electric ﬂux ⌬⌽ E through this element is
⌬⌽E ⫽ E i ⌬Ai cos ␪ ⫽ E i ⭈ ⌬ A i
where we have used the deﬁnition of the scalar product of two vectors
(A ⴢ B ⫽ AB cos ␪). By summing the contributions of all elements, we obtain the
total ﬂux through the surface.1 If we let the area of each element approach zero,
then the number of elements approaches inﬁnity and the sum is replaced by an integral. Therefore, the general deﬁnition of electric ﬂux is

Equation 24.3 is a surface integral, which means it must be evaluated over the surface in question. In general, the value of ⌽ E depends both on the ﬁeld pattern and
on the surface.
We are often interested in evaluating the ﬂux through a closed surface, which is
deﬁned as one that divides space into an inside and an outside region, so that one
cannot move from one region to the other without crossing the surface. The surface of a sphere, for example, is a closed surface.
Consider the closed surface in Figure 24.4. The vectors ⌬Ai point in different
directions for the various surface elements, but at each point they are normal to

It is important to note that drawings with ﬁeld lines have their inaccuracies because a small area element (depending on its location) may happen to have too many or too few ﬁeld lines penetrating it.

the ﬁeld lines are crossing the surface from the inside to the outside and ␪ ⬍ 90⬚;
hence, the ﬂux ⌬⌽E ⫽ E ⴢ ⌬Ai through this element is positive. For element 쩹,
the ﬁeld lines graze the surface (perpendicular to the vector ⌬Ai ); thus, ␪ ⫽ 90⬚
and the ﬂux is zero. For elements such as 쩺, where the ﬁeld lines are crossing the
surface from outside to inside, 180⬚ ⬎ ␪ ⬎ 90⬚ and the ﬂux is negative because
cos ␪ is negative. The net ﬂux through the surface is proportional to the net number of lines leaving the surface, where the net number means the number leaving the
surface minus the number entering the surface. If more lines are leaving than entering,
the net ﬂux is positive. If more lines are entering than leaving, the net ﬂux is negative. Using the symbol 冖 to represent an integral over a closed surface, we can write

where E n represents the component of the electric ﬁeld normal to the surface.
Evaluating the net ﬂux through a closed surface can be very cumbersome. However, if the ﬁeld is normal to the surface at each point and constant in magnitude,
the calculation is straightforward, as it was in Example 24.1. The next example also
illustrates this point.

GAUSS’S LAW

In this section we describe a general relationship between the net electric ﬂux
through a closed surface (often called a gaussian surface) and the charge enclosed
by the surface. This relationship, known as Gauss’s law, is of fundamental importance in the study of electric ﬁelds.
Let us again consider a positive point charge q located at the center of a
sphere of radius r, as shown in Figure 24.6. From Equation 23.4 we know that the
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld everywhere on the surface of the sphere is
E ⫽ k e q /r 2. As noted in Example 24.1, the ﬁeld lines are directed radially outward
and hence perpendicular to the surface at every point on the surface. That is, at
each surface point, E is parallel to the vector ⌬A i representing a local element of
area ⌬A i surrounding the surface point. Therefore,
E ⴢ ⌬ A i ⫽ E ⌬Ai
and from Equation 24.4 we ﬁnd that the net ﬂux through the gaussian surface is

number of lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the
surface.

The net electric ﬂux through a
closed surface is zero if there is no
charge inside

Note from Equation 24.5 that the net ﬂux through the spherical surface is
proportional to the charge inside. The ﬂux is independent of the radius r because
the area of the spherical surface is proportional to r 2, whereas the electric ﬁeld is
proportional to 1/r 2. Thus, in the product of area and electric ﬁeld, the dependence on r cancels.
Now consider several closed surfaces surrounding a charge q, as shown in Figure 24.7. Surface S 1 is spherical, but surfaces S 2 and S 3 are not. From Equation
24.5, the ﬂux that passes through S 1 has the value q/⑀0 . As we discussed in the previous section, ﬂux is proportional to the number of electric ﬁeld lines passing
through a surface. The construction shown in Figure 24.7 shows that the number
of lines through S 1 is equal to the number of lines through the nonspherical surfaces S 2 and S 3 . Therefore, we conclude that the net ﬂux through any closed surface is independent of the shape of that surface. The net ﬂux through any
closed surface surrounding a point charge q is given by q/⑀0 .
Now consider a point charge located outside a closed surface of arbitrary
shape, as shown in Figure 24.8. As you can see from this construction, any electric
ﬁeld line that enters the surface leaves the surface at another point. The number
of electric ﬁeld lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the surface.
Therefore, we conclude that the net electric ﬂux through a closed surface that
surrounds no charge is zero. If we apply this result to Example 24.2, we can easily see that the net ﬂux through the cube is zero because there is no charge inside
the cube.

Quick Quiz 24.1
Suppose that the charge in Example 24.1 is just outside the sphere, 1.01 m from its center.
What is the total ﬂux through the sphere?

Let us extend these arguments to two generalized cases: (1) that of many
point charges and (2) that of a continuous distribution of charge. We once again
use the superposition principle, which states that the electric ﬁeld due to many
charges is the vector sum of the electric ﬁelds produced by the individual
charges. Therefore, we can express the ﬂux through any closed surface as

冖

E ⴢ dA ⫽

冖

(E 1 ⫹ E 2 ⫹ ⭈⭈⭈) ⴢ dA

where E is the total electric ﬁeld at any point on the surface produced by the vector addition of the electric ﬁelds at that point due to the individual charges.

749

24.2 Gauss’s Law

Consider the system of charges shown in Figure 24.9. The surface S surrounds
only one charge, q1 ; hence, the net ﬂux through S is q1 /⑀0 . The ﬂux through S
due to charges q 2 and q 3 outside it is zero because each electric ﬁeld line that enters S at one point leaves it at another. The surface S⬘ surrounds charges q 2 and q 3 ;
hence, the net ﬂux through it is (q 2 ⫹ q 3 )/⑀0. Finally, the net ﬂux through surface
S ⬙ is zero because there is no charge inside this surface. That is, all the electric
ﬁeld lines that enter S ⬙ at one point leave at another.
Gauss’s law, which is a generalization of what we have just described, states
that the net ﬂux through any closed surface is
⌽E ⫽

冖

E ⴢ dA ⫽

q in
⑀0

(24.6)

where q in represents the net charge inside the surface and E represents the electric ﬁeld at any point on the surface.
A formal proof of Gauss’s law is presented in Section 24.6. When using Equation 24.6, you should note that although the charge q in is the net charge inside the
gaussian surface, E represents the total electric ﬁeld, which includes contributions
from charges both inside and outside the surface.
In principle, Gauss’s law can be solved for E to determine the electric ﬁeld
due to a system of charges or a continuous distribution of charge. In practice, however, this type of solution is applicable only in a limited number of highly symmetric situations. As we shall see in the next section, Gauss’s law can be used to evaluate the electric ﬁeld for charge distributions that have spherical, cylindrical, or
planar symmetry. If one chooses the gaussian surface surrounding the charge distribution carefully, the integral in Equation 24.6 can be simpliﬁed. You should also
note that a gaussian surface is a mathematical construction and need not coincide
with any real physical surface.

Quick Quiz 24.2
For a gaussian surface through which the net ﬂux is zero, the following four statements
could be true. Which of the statements must be true? (a) There are no charges inside the surface. (b) The net charge inside the surface is zero. (c) The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere
on the surface. (d) The number of electric ﬁeld lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the surface.

The net electric ﬂux
through any closed surface depends only on the charge inside
that surface. The net ﬂux through
surface S is q 1 /⑀0 , the net ﬂux
through surface S ⬘ is (q 2 ⫹ q 3 )/⑀0 ,
and the net ﬂux through surface
S ⬙ is zero.

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 24.3
A spherical gaussian surface surrounds a point charge q. Describe what happens to the total ﬂux through the surface if
(a) the charge is tripled, (b) the radius of the sphere is doubled, (c) the surface is changed to a cube, and (d) the charge
is moved to another location inside the surface.

Solution (a) The ﬂux through the surface is tripled
because ﬂux is proportional to the amount of charge inside
the surface.
(b) The ﬂux does not change because all electric ﬁeld

lines from the charge pass through the sphere, regardless of
its radius.
(c) The ﬂux does not change when the shape of the gaussian surface changes because all electric ﬁeld lines from the
charge pass through the surface, regardless of its shape.
(d) The ﬂux does not change when the charge is moved
to another location inside that surface because Gauss’s law
refers to the total charge enclosed, regardless of where the
charge is located inside the surface.

APPLICATION OF GAUSS’S LAW TO
CHARGED INSULATORS

24.3

As mentioned earlier, Gauss’s law is useful in determining electric ﬁelds when the
charge distribution is characterized by a high degree of symmetry. The following
examples demonstrate ways of choosing the gaussian surface over which the surface integral given by Equation 24.6 can be simpliﬁed and the electric ﬁeld determined. In choosing the surface, we should always take advantage of the symmetry
of the charge distribution so that we can remove E from the integral and solve for
it. The goal in this type of calculation is to determine a surface that satisﬁes one or
more of the following conditions:
1. The value of the electric ﬁeld can be argued by symmetry to be constant over
the surface.
2. The dot product in Equation 24.6 can be expressed as a simple algebraic product E dA because E and dA are parallel.
3. The dot product in Equation 24.6 is zero because E and dA are perpendicular.
4. The ﬁeld can be argued to be zero over the surface.
All four of these conditions are used in examples throughout the remainder of
this chapter.

EXAMPLE 24.4

The Electric Field Due to a Point Charge

Starting with Gauss’s law, calculate the electric ﬁeld due to an
isolated point charge q.

where we have used the fact that the surface area of a sphere
is 4␲r 2. Now, we solve for the electric ﬁeld:

Solution

A single charge represents the simplest possible
charge distribution, and we use this familiar case to show how
to solve for the electric ﬁeld with Gauss’s law. We choose a
spherical gaussian surface of radius r centered on the point
charge, as shown in Figure 24.10. The electric ﬁeld due to a
positive point charge is directed radially outward by symmetry
and is therefore normal to the surface at every point. Thus, as
in condition (2), E is parallel to d A at each point. Therefore,
E ⴢ d A ⫽ E dA and Gauss’s law gives

A Spherically Symmetric Charge Distribution

An insulating solid sphere of radius a has a uniform volume
charge density ␳ and carries a total positive charge Q (Fig.
24.11). (a) Calculate the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at a
point outside the sphere.

Solution Because the charge distribution is spherically
symmetric, we again select a spherical gaussian surface of radius r, concentric with the sphere, as shown in Figure 24.11a.
For this choice, conditions (1) and (2) are satisﬁed, as they

Note that this result is identical to the one we obtained for a
point charge. Therefore, we conclude that, for a uniformly
charged sphere, the ﬁeld in the region external to the sphere
is equivalent to that of a point charge located at the center of
the sphere.
(b) Find the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at a point inside the sphere.

Solution In this case we select a spherical gaussian surface
having radius r ⬍ a, concentric with the insulated sphere
(Fig. 24.11b). Let us denote the volume of this smaller
sphere by V ⬘. To apply Gauss’s law in this situation, it is important to recognize that the charge q in within the gaussian
surface of volume V ⬘ is less than Q . To calculate q in , we use
the fact that q in ⫽ ␳V ⬘:

the result eliminates the problem that would exist at r ⫽ 0 if
E varied as 1/r 2 inside the sphere as it does outside the
sphere. That is, if E ⬀ 1/r 2 for r ⬍ a, the ﬁeld would be inﬁnite at r ⫽ 0, which is physically impossible. Note also that
the expressions for parts (a) and (b) match when r ⫽ a.
A plot of E versus r is shown in Figure 24.12.

The Electric Field Due to a Thin Spherical Shell

(a) The calculation for the ﬁeld outside the shell

r ⬎ a concentric with the shell (Fig. 24.13b), the charge inside this surface is Q . Therefore, the ﬁeld at a point outside

Solution

The symmetry of the charge distribution requires that E be perpendicular to the line charge and directed outward, as shown in Figure 24.14a and b. To reﬂect
the symmetry of the charge distribution, we select a cylindrical gaussian surface of radius r and length ᐉ that is coaxial
with the line charge. For the curved part of this surface, E is
constant in magnitude and perpendicular to the surface at
each point — satisfaction of conditions (1) and (2). Furthermore, the ﬂux through the ends of the gaussian cylinder is
zero because E is parallel to these surfaces — the ﬁrst application we have seen of condition (3).
We take the surface integral in Gauss’s law over the entire
gaussian surface. Because of the zero value of E ⴢ d A for the
ends of the cylinder, however, we can restrict our attention to
only the curved surface of the cylinder.
The total charge inside our gaussian surface is ␭ᐉ. Applying Gauss’s law and conditions (1) and (2), we ﬁnd that for

Thus, we see that the electric ﬁeld due to a cylindrically symmetric charge distribution varies as 1/r, whereas the ﬁeld external to a spherically symmetric charge distribution varies as
1/r 2. Equation 24.7 was also derived in Chapter 23 (see Problem 35[b]), by integration of the ﬁeld of a point charge.
If the line charge in this example were of ﬁnite length,
the result for E would not be that given by Equation 24.7. A
ﬁnite line charge does not possess sufﬁcient symmetry for us
to make use of Gauss’s law. This is because the magnitude of

EXAMPLE 24.8

A Nonconducting Plane of Charge

Find the electric ﬁeld due to a nonconducting, inﬁnite plane
of positive charge with uniform surface charge density ␴.

Solution By symmetry, E must be perpendicular to the
plane and must have the same magnitude at all points
equidistant from the plane. The fact that the direction of E is
away from positive charges indicates that the direction of E
on one side of the plane must be opposite its direction on the
other side, as shown in Figure 24.15. A gaussian surface that
reﬂects the symmetry is a small cylinder whose axis is perpendicular to the plane and whose ends each have an area A and
are equidistant from the plane. Because E is parallel to the
curved surface — and, therefore, perpendicular to d A everywhere on the surface — condition (3) is satisﬁed and there is
no contribution to the surface integral from this surface. For
the ﬂat ends of the cylinder, conditions (1) and (2) are satisﬁed. The ﬂux through each end of the cylinder is EA;
hence, the total ﬂux through the entire gaussian surface is
just that through the ends, ⌽E ⫽ 2EA.
Noting that the total charge inside the surface is q in ⫽ ␴A,
we use Gauss’s law and ﬁnd that
⌽E ⫽ 2EA ⫽

E⫽

the electric ﬁeld is no longer constant over the surface of
the gaussian cylinder — the ﬁeld near the ends of the line
would be different from that far from the ends. Thus, condition (1) would not be satisﬁed in this situation. Furthermore, E is not perpendicular to the cylindrical surface at all
points — the ﬁeld vectors near the ends would have a component parallel to the line. Thus, condition (2) would not be
satisﬁed. When there is insufﬁcient symmetry in the charge
distribution, as in this situation, it is necessary to use Equation 23.6 to calculate E.
For points close to a ﬁnite line charge and far from the
ends, Equation 24.7 gives a good approximation of the value
of the ﬁeld.
It is left for you to show (see Problem 29) that the electric
ﬁeld inside a uniformly charged rod of ﬁnite radius and inﬁnite length is proportional to r.

␴
2⑀0

Because the distance from each ﬂat end of the cylinder to
the plane does not appear in Equation 24.8, we conclude that
E ⫽ ␴/2⑀0 at any distance from the plane. That is, the ﬁeld is
uniform everywhere.
An important charge conﬁguration related to this example consists of two parallel planes, one positively charged and
the other negatively charged, and each with a surface charge
density ␴ (see Problem 58). In this situation, the electric
ﬁelds due to the two planes add in the region between the
planes, resulting in a ﬁeld of magnitude ␴/⑀0 , and cancel
elsewhere to give a ﬁeld of zero.

CONDUCTORS IN ELECTROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM

As we learned in Section 23.2, a good electrical conductor contains charges (electrons) that are not bound to any atom and therefore are free to move about within
the material. When there is no net motion of charge within a conductor, the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium. As we shall see, a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has the following properties:

1. The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere inside the conductor.
2. If an isolated conductor carries a charge, the charge resides on its surface.
3. The electric ﬁeld just outside a charged conductor is perpendicular to the surface of the conductor and has a magnitude ␴/⑀0 , where ␴ is the surface charge
density at that point.
4. On an irregularly shaped conductor, the surface charge density is greatest at locations where the radius of curvature of the surface is smallest.
We verify the ﬁrst three properties in the discussion that follows. The fourth
property is presented here without further discussion so that we have a complete
list of properties for conductors in electrostatic equilibrium.
We can understand the ﬁrst property by considering a conducting slab placed
in an external ﬁeld E (Fig. 24.16). We can argue that the electric ﬁeld inside the
conductor must be zero under the assumption that we have electrostatic equilibrium. If the ﬁeld were not zero, free charges in the conductor would accelerate
under the action of the ﬁeld. This motion of electrons, however, would mean that
the conductor is not in electrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the existence of electrostatic equilibrium is consistent only with a zero ﬁeld in the conductor.
Let us investigate how this zero ﬁeld is accomplished. Before the external ﬁeld
is applied, free electrons are uniformly distributed throughout the conductor.
When the external ﬁeld is applied, the free electrons accelerate to the left in Figure 24.16, causing a plane of negative charge to be present on the left surface. The
movement of electrons to the left results in a plane of positive charge on the right
surface. These planes of charge create an additional electric ﬁeld inside the conductor that opposes the external ﬁeld. As the electrons move, the surface charge
density increases until the magnitude of the internal ﬁeld equals that of the external ﬁeld, and the net result is a net ﬁeld of zero inside the conductor. The time it
takes a good conductor to reach equilibrium is of the order of 10⫺16 s, which for
most purposes can be considered instantaneous.
We can use Gauss’s law to verify the second property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium. Figure 24.17 shows an arbitrarily shaped conductor. A gaussian
surface is drawn inside the conductor and can be as close to the conductor’s surface as we wish. As we have just shown, the electric ﬁeld everywhere inside the conductor is zero when it is in electrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, the electric ﬁeld
must be zero at every point on the gaussian surface, in accordance with condition
(4) in Section 24.3. Thus, the net ﬂux through this gaussian surface is zero. From
this result and Gauss’s law, we conclude that the net charge inside the gaussian sur-

face is zero. Because there can be no net charge inside the gaussian surface (which
is arbitrarily close to the conductor’s surface), any net charge on the conductor
must reside on its surface. Gauss’s law does not indicate how this excess charge
is distributed on the conductor’s surface.
We can also use Gauss’s law to verify the third property. We draw a gaussian
surface in the shape of a small cylinder whose end faces are parallel to the surface
of the conductor (Fig. 24.18). Part of the cylinder is just outside the conductor,
and part is inside. The ﬁeld is normal to the conductor’s surface from the condition of electrostatic equilibrium. (If E had a component parallel to the conductor’s surface, the free charges would move along the surface; in such a case, the
conductor would not be in equilibrium.) Thus, we satisfy condition (3) in Section
24.3 for the curved part of the cylindrical gaussian surface — there is no ﬂux
through this part of the gaussian surface because E is parallel to the surface.
There is no ﬂux through the ﬂat face of the cylinder inside the conductor because
here E ⫽ 0 — satisfaction of condition (4). Hence, the net ﬂux through the gaussian surface is that through only the ﬂat face outside the conductor, where the ﬁeld
is perpendicular to the gaussian surface. Using conditions (1) and (2) for this
face, the ﬂux is EA, where E is the electric ﬁeld just outside the conductor and A is
the area of the cylinder’s face. Applying Gauss’s law to this surface, we obtain

A Sphere Inside a Spherical Shell

A solid conducting sphere of radius a carries a net positive
charge 2Q . A conducting spherical shell of inner radius b

ﬁeld in the regions labeled 쩸, 쩹, 쩺, and 쩻 in Figure 24.19

Solution

First note that the charge distributions on both
the sphere and the shell are characterized by spherical symmetry around their common center. To determine the electric ﬁeld at various distances r from this center, we construct a
spherical gaussian surface for each of the four regions of interest. Such a surface for region 쩹 is shown in Figure 24.19.
To ﬁnd E inside the solid sphere (region 쩸), consider a

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF
GAUSS’S LAW AND COULOMB’S LAW

When a net charge is placed on a conductor, the charge distributes itself on the
surface in such a way that the electric ﬁeld inside the conductor is zero. Gauss’s
law shows that there can be no net charge inside the conductor in this situation. In
this section, we investigate an experimental veriﬁcation of the absence of this
charge.
We have seen that Gauss’s law is equivalent to Equation 23.6, the expression
for the electric ﬁeld of a distribution of charge. Because this equation arises
from Coulomb’s law, we can claim theoretically that Gauss’s law and Coulomb’s
law are equivalent. Hence, it is possible to test the validity of both laws by attempting to detect a net charge inside a conductor or, equivalently, a nonzero
electric ﬁeld inside the conductor. If a nonzero ﬁeld is detected within the conductor, Gauss’s law and Coulomb’s law are invalid. Many experiments, including

757

24.5 Experimental Verification of Gauss’s Law and Coulomb’s Law

early work by Faraday, Cavendish, and Maxwell, have been performed to detect
the ﬁeld inside a conductor. In all reported cases, no electric ﬁeld could be detected inside a conductor.
Here is one of the experiments that can be performed.2 A positively charged
metal ball at the end of a silk thread is lowered through a small opening into an
uncharged hollow conductor that is insulated from ground (Fig. 24.20a). The positively charged ball induces a negative charge on the inner wall of the hollow conductor, leaving an equal positive charge on the outer wall (Fig. 24.20b). The presence of positive charge on the outer wall is indicated by the deﬂection of the
needle of an electrometer (a device used to measure charge and that measures
charge only on the outer surface of the conductor). The ball is then lowered and
allowed to touch the inner surface of the hollow conductor (Fig. 24.20c). Charge
is transferred between the ball and the inner surface so that neither is charged after contact is made. The needle deﬂection remains unchanged while this happens,
indicating that the charge on the outer surface is unaffected. When the ball is removed, the electrometer reading remains the same (Fig. 24.20d). Furthermore,
the ball is found to be uncharged; this veriﬁes that charge was transferred between
the ball and the inner surface of the hollow conductor. The overall effect is
that the charge that was originally on the ball now appears on the hollow conductor. The fact that the deﬂection of the needle on the electrometer measuring the
charge on the outer surface remained unchanged regardless of what was happening inside the hollow conductor indicates that the net charge on the system always
resided on the outer surface of the conductor.
If we now apply another positive charge to the metal ball and place it near the
outside of the conductor, it is repelled by the conductor. This demonstrates that
E ⫽ 0 outside the conductor, a ﬁnding consistent with the fact that the conductor
carries a net charge. If the charged metal ball is now lowered into the interior of
the charged hollow conductor, it exhibits no evidence of an electric force. This
shows that E ⫽ 0 inside the hollow conductor.
This experiment veriﬁes the predictions of Gauss’s law and therefore veriﬁes
Coulomb’s law. The equivalence of Gauss’s law and Coulomb’s law is due to the
inverse-square behavior of the electric force. Thus, we can interpret this experiment as verifying the exponent of 2 in the 1/r 2 behavior of the electric force. Experiments by Williams, Faller, and Hill in 1971 showed that the exponent of r in
Coulomb’s law is (2 ⫹ ␦ ), where ␦ ⫽ (2.7 ⫾ 3.1) ⫻ 10 ⫺16 !
In the experiment we have described, the charged ball hanging in the hollow
conductor would show no deﬂection even in the case in which an external electric
ﬁeld is applied to the entire system. The ﬁeld inside the conductor is still zero.
This ability of conductors to “block” external electric ﬁelds is utilized in many
places, from electromagnetic shielding for computer components to thin metal
coatings on the glass in airport control towers to keep radar originating outside
the tower from disrupting the electronics inside. Cellular telephone users riding
trains like the one pictured at the beginning of the chapter have to speak loudly to
be heard above the noise of the train. In response to complaints from other passengers, the train companies are considering coating the windows with a thin
metallic conductor. This coating, combined with the metal frame of the train car,
blocks cellular telephone transmissions into and out of the train.

The experiment is often referred to as Faraday’s ice-pail experiment because Faraday, the ﬁrst to perform
it, used an ice pail for the hollow conductor.

FORMAL DERIVATION OF GAUSS’S LAW

One way of deriving Gauss’s law involves solid angles. Consider a spherical surface
of radius r containing an area element ⌬A. The solid angle ⌬⍀ (uppercase Greek
omega) subtended at the center of the sphere by this element is deﬁned to be

A closed surface of

charge q. The net electric ﬂux
through the surface is independent
of the shape of the surface.

⌬A
r2

From this equation, we see that ⌬⍀ has no dimensions because ⌬A and r 2 both have
dimensions L2. The dimensionless unit of a solid angle is the steradian. (You may
want to compare this equation to Equation 10.1b, the deﬁnition of the radian.) Because the surface area of a sphere is 4␲r 2, the total solid angle subtended by the
sphere is
4␲ r 2
⍀⫽
⫽ 4␲ steradians
r2
Now consider a point charge q surrounded by a closed surface of arbitrary
shape (Fig. 24.21). The total electric ﬂux through this surface can be obtained by
evaluating E ⴢ ⌬A for each small area element ⌬A and summing over all elements.
The ﬂux through each element is
⌬A cos ␪
⌬⌽E ⫽ E ⴢ ⌬A ⫽ E ⌬A cos ␪ ⫽ k e q
r2
where r is the distance from the charge to the area element, ␪ is the angle between
the electric ﬁeld E and ⌬A for the element, and E ⫽ k e q /r 2 for a point charge. In
Figure 24.22, we see that the projection of the area element perpendicular to the
radius vector is ⌬A cos ␪. Thus, the quantity ⌬A cos ␪/r 2 is equal to the solid angle
⌬⍀ that the surface element ⌬A subtends at the charge q. We also see that ⌬⍀ is
equal to the solid angle subtended by the area element of a spherical surface of radius r. Because the total solid angle at a point is 4␲ steradians, the total ﬂux

Thus we have derived Gauss’s law, Equation 24.6. Note that this result is independent of the shape of the closed surface and independent of the position of the
charge within the surface.

SUMMARY
Electric ﬂux is proportional to the number of electric ﬁeld lines that penetrate a
surface. If the electric ﬁeld is uniform and makes an angle ␪ with the normal to a
surface of area A, the electric ﬂux through the surface is

CHAPTER 24

Gauss’s Law

A conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has the following properties:
1. The electric ﬁeld is zero everywhere inside the conductor.
2. Any net charge on the conductor resides entirely on its surface.
3. The electric ﬁeld just outside the conductor is perpendicular to its surface and
has a magnitude ␴/⑀0 , where ␴ is the surface charge density at that point.
4. On an irregularly shaped conductor, the surface charge density is greatest
where the radius of curvature of the surface is the smallest.

Problem-Solving Hints
Gauss’s law, as we have seen, is very powerful in solving problems involving
highly symmetric charge distributions. In this chapter, you encountered three
kinds of symmetry: planar, cylindrical, and spherical. It is important to review
Examples 24.4 through 24.10 and to adhere to the following procedure when
using Gauss’s law:
• Select a gaussian surface that has a symmetry to match that of the charge
distribution and satisﬁes one or more of the conditions listed in Section
24.3. For point charges or spherically symmetric charge distributions, the
gaussian surface should be a sphere centered on the charge as in Examples
24.4, 24.5, 24.6, and 24.10. For uniform line charges or uniformly charged
cylinders, your gaussian surface should be a cylindrical surface that is coaxial with the line charge or cylinder as in Example 24.7. For planes of charge,
a useful choice is a cylindrical gaussian surface that straddles the plane, as
shown in Example 24.8. These choices enable you to simplify the surface integral that appears in Gauss’s law and represents the total electric ﬂux
through that surface.
• Evaluate the q in /⑀0 term in Gauss’s law, which amounts to calculating the total electric charge q in inside the gaussian surface. If the charge density is
uniform (that is, if ␭, ␴, or ␳ is constant), simply multiply that charge density
by the length, area, or volume enclosed by the gaussian surface. If the
charge distribution is nonuniform, integrate the charge density over the region enclosed by the gaussian surface. For example, if the charge is distributed along a line, integrate the expression dq ⫽ ␭ dx, where dq is the charge
on an inﬁnitesimal length element dx. For a plane of charge, integrate
dq ⫽ ␴ dA, where dA is an inﬁnitesimal element of area. For a volume of
charge, integrate dq ⫽ ␳ dV, where dV is an inﬁnitesimal element of volume.
• Once the terms in Gauss’s law have been evaluated, solve for the electric
ﬁeld on the gaussian surface if the charge distribution is given in the problem. Conversely, if the electric ﬁeld is known, calculate the charge distribution that produces the ﬁeld.

QUESTIONS
1. The Sun is lower in the sky during the winter than it is in
the summer. How does this change the ﬂux of sunlight
hitting a given area on the surface of the Earth? How
does this affect the weather?
2. If the electric ﬁeld in a region of space is zero, can you
conclude no electric charges are in that region?

3. If more electric ﬁeld lines are leaving a gaussian surface
than entering, what can you conclude about the net
charge enclosed by that surface?
4. A uniform electric ﬁeld exists in a region of space in
which there are no charges. What can you conclude
about the net electric ﬂux through a gaussian surface
placed in this region of space?

Problems
5. If the total charge inside a closed surface is known but
the distribution of the charge is unspeciﬁed, can you use
Gauss’s law to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld? Explain.
6. Explain why the electric ﬂux through a closed surface
with a given enclosed charge is independent of the size or
shape of the surface.
7. Consider the electric ﬁeld due to a nonconducting inﬁnite plane having a uniform charge density. Explain why
the electric ﬁeld does not depend on the distance from
the plane in terms of the spacing of the electric ﬁeld
lines.
8. Use Gauss’s law to explain why electric ﬁeld lines must begin or end on electric charges. (Hint: Change the size of
the gaussian surface.)
9. On the basis of the repulsive nature of the force between
like charges and the freedom of motion of charge within
the conductor, explain why excess charge on an isolated
conductor must reside on its surface.
10. A person is placed in a large, hollow metallic sphere that
is insulated from ground. If a large charge is placed on
the sphere, will the person be harmed upon touching the
inside of the sphere? Explain what will happen if the per-

son also has an initial charge whose sign is opposite that
of the charge on the sphere.
How would the observations described in Figure 24.20
differ if the hollow conductor were grounded? How
would they differ if the small charged ball were an insulator rather than a conductor?
What other experiment might be performed on the ball
in Figure 24.20 to show that its charge was transferred to
the hollow conductor?
What would happen to the electrometer reading if the
charged ball in Figure 24.20 touched the inner wall of the
conductor? the outer wall?
You may have heard that one of the safer places to be during a lightning storm is inside a car. Why would this be
the case?
Two solid spheres, both of radius R, carry identical total
charges Q . One sphere is a good conductor, while the
other is an insulator. If the charge on the insulating
sphere is uniformly distributed throughout its interior
volume, how do the electric ﬁelds outside these two
spheres compare? Are the ﬁelds identical inside the two
spheres?

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
24.1 Zero, because there is no net charge within the surface.
24.2 (b) and (d). Statement (a) is not necessarily true because an equal number of positive and negative charges
could be present inside the surface. Statement (c) is not
necessarily true, as can be seen from Figure 24.8: A
nonzero electric ﬁeld exists everywhere on the surface,
but the charge is not enclosed within the surface; thus,
the net ﬂux is zero.

24.3 Any gaussian surface surrounding the system encloses
the same amount of charge, regardless of how the components of the system are moved. Thus, the ﬂux
through the gaussian surface would be the same as it is
when the sphere and shell are concentric.

25.1 Potential Difference and Electric Potential

he concept of potential energy was introduced in Chapter 8 in connection
with such conservative forces as the force of gravity and the elastic force exerted
by a spring. By using the law of conservation of energy, we were able to avoid
working directly with forces when solving various problems in mechanics. In this
chapter we see that the concept of potential energy is also of great value in the
study of electricity. Because the electrostatic force given by Coulomb’s law is conservative, electrostatic phenomena can be conveniently described in terms of an
electric potential energy. This idea enables us to deﬁne a scalar quantity known as
electric potential. Because the electric potential at any point in an electric ﬁeld is a
scalar function, we can use it to describe electrostatic phenomena more simply
than if we were to rely only on the concepts of the electric ﬁeld and electric forces.
In later chapters we shall see that the concept of electric potential is of great practical value.

POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE AND ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

When a test charge q 0 is placed in an electric ﬁeld E created by some other
charged object, the electric force acting on the test charge is q 0 E. (If the ﬁeld is
produced by more than one charged object, this force acting on the test charge is
the vector sum of the individual forces exerted on it by the various other charged
objects.) The force q 0 E is conservative because the individual forces described by
Coulomb’s law are conservative. When the test charge is moved in the ﬁeld by
some external agent, the work done by the ﬁeld on the charge is equal to the negative of the work done by the external agent causing the displacement. For an inﬁnitesimal displacement ds, the work done by the electric ﬁeld on the charge is
F ⴢ d s  q 0 E ⴢ ds. As this amount of work is done by the ﬁeld, the potential energy
of the charge – ﬁeld system is decreased by an amount dU  q 0 E ⴢ ds. For a ﬁnite
displacement of the charge from a point A to a point B, the change in potential
energy of the system U  U B  U A is
U  q 0

(25.1)

The integration is performed along the path that q 0 follows as it moves from A to
B, and the integral is called either a path integral or a line integral (the two terms are
synonymous). Because the force q 0 E is conservative, this line integral does not
depend on the path taken from A to B.

Quick Quiz 25.1
If the path between A and B does not make any difference in Equation 25.1, why don’t we
just use the expression U  q 0 Ed, where d is the straight-line distance between A and B ?

The potential energy per unit charge U/q 0 is independent of the value of q 0
and has a unique value at every point in an electric ﬁeld. This quantity U/q 0 is
called the electric potential (or simply the potential) V. Thus, the electric potential at any point in an electric ﬁeld is

Electric Potential

The fact that potential energy is a scalar quantity means that electric potential also
is a scalar quantity.
The potential difference V  VB  VA between any two points A and B in an
electric ﬁeld is deﬁned as the change in potential energy of the system divided by
the test charge q 0 :

Potential difference should not be confused with difference in potential energy.
The potential difference is proportional to the change in potential energy, and we
see from Equation 25.3 that the two are related by U  q 0 V.
Electric potential is a scalar characteristic of an electric ﬁeld, independent of the charges that may be placed in the ﬁeld. However, when we speak
of potential energy, we are referring to the charge – ﬁeld system. Because we
are usually interested in knowing the electric potential at the location of a charge
and the potential energy resulting from the interaction of the charge with the
ﬁeld, we follow the common convention of speaking of the potential energy as if it
belonged to the charge.
Because the change in potential energy of a charge is the negative of the work
done by the electric ﬁeld on the charge (as noted in Equation 25.1), the potential
difference V between points A and B equals the work per unit charge that an external agent must perform to move a test charge from A to B without changing the
kinetic energy of the test charge.
Just as with potential energy, only differences in electric potential are meaningful. To avoid having to work with potential differences, however, we often take the
value of the electric potential to be zero at some convenient point in an electric
ﬁeld. This is what we do here: arbitrarily establish the electric potential to be zero
at a point that is inﬁnitely remote from the charges producing the ﬁeld. Having
made this choice, we can state that the electric potential at an arbitrary point
in an electric ﬁeld equals the work required per unit charge to bring a positive test charge from inﬁnity to that point. Thus, if we take point A in Equation
25.3 to be at inﬁnity, the electric potential at any point P is

(25.4)

In reality, VP represents the potential difference V between the point P and a
point at inﬁnity. (Eq. 25.4 is a special case of Eq. 25.3.)
Because electric potential is a measure of potential energy per unit charge, the
SI unit of both electric potential and potential difference is joules per coulomb,
which is deﬁned as a volt (V):

That is, 1 J of work must be done to move a 1-C charge through a potential difference of 1 V.
Equation 25.3 shows that potential difference also has units of electric ﬁeld
times distance. From this, it follows that the SI unit of electric ﬁeld (N/C) can also
be expressed in volts per meter:

25.2 Potential Differences in a Uniform Electric Field

A unit of energy commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics is the electron
volt (eV), which is deﬁned as the energy an electron (or proton) gains or loses
by moving through a potential difference of 1 V. Because 1 V  1 J/C and because the fundamental charge is approximately 1.60  1019 C, the electron volt is
related to the joule as follows:
1 eV  1.60  10 19 CV  1.60  10 19 J

(25.5)

The electron volt

For instance, an electron in the beam of a typical television picture tube may have
a speed of 3.5  107 m/s. This corresponds to a kinetic energy of 5.6  1016 J,
which is equivalent to 3.5  103 eV. Such an electron has to be accelerated from
rest through a potential difference of 3.5 kV to reach this speed.

UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD

Equations 25.1 and 25.3 hold in all electric ﬁelds, whether uniform or varying, but
they can be simpliﬁed for a uniform ﬁeld. First, consider a uniform electric ﬁeld
directed along the negative y axis, as shown in Figure 25.1a. Let us calculate the
potential difference between two points A and B separated by a distance d, where
d is measured parallel to the ﬁeld lines. Equation 25.3 gives

The minus sign indicates that point B is at a lower electric potential than point A;
that is, VB  VA . Electric ﬁeld lines always point in the direction of decreasing electric potential, as shown in Figure 25.1a.
Now suppose that a test charge q 0 moves from A to B. We can calculate the
change in its potential energy from Equations 25.3 and 25.6:

From this result, we see that if q 0 is positive, then U is negative. We conclude that
a positive charge loses electric potential energy when it moves in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. This means that an electric ﬁeld does work on a positive
charge when the charge moves in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. (This is analogous to the work done by the gravitational ﬁeld on a falling mass, as shown in Figure 25.1b.) If a positive test charge is released from rest in this electric ﬁeld, it experiences an electric force q 0 E in the direction of E (downward in Fig. 25.1a).
Therefore, it accelerates downward, gaining kinetic energy. As the charged particle gains kinetic energy, it loses an equal amount of potential energy.
If q 0 is negative, then U is positive and the situation is reversed: A negative
charge gains electric potential energy when it moves in the direction of the
electric ﬁeld. If a negative charge is released from rest in the ﬁeld E, it accelerates in a direction opposite the direction of the ﬁeld.
Now consider the more general case of a charged particle that is free to move
between any two points in a uniform electric ﬁeld directed along the x axis, as
shown in Figure 25.2. (In this situation, the charge is not being moved by an external agent as before.) If s represents the displacement vector between points A and
B, Equation 25.3 gives

It takes an electric ﬁeld of about
30 000 V/cm to cause a spark in dry
air. Shufﬂe across a rug and reach toward a doorknob. By estimating the
length of the spark, determine the
electric potential difference between
your ﬁnger and the doorknob after
shufﬂing your feet but before touching the knob. (If it is very humid on

Finally, we conclude from Equation 25.8 that all points in a plane perpendicular to a uniform electric ﬁeld are at the same electric potential. We can see this in
Figure 25.2, where the potential difference VB  VA is equal to the potential difference VC  VA . (Prove this to yourself by working out the dot product E ⴢ s for
s A:B , where the angle between E and s is arbitrary as shown in Figure 25.2, and
the dot product for s A:C , where  0.) Therefore, VB  VC . The name equipotential surface is given to any surface consisting of a continuous distribution of points having the same electric potential.
Note that because U  q 0 V, no work is done in moving a test charge between any two points on an equipotential surface. The equipotential surfaces of a
uniform electric ﬁeld consist of a family of planes that are all perpendicular to the
ﬁeld. Equipotential surfaces for ﬁelds with other symmetries are described in later
sections.

conductors attached to the battery terminals. A 12-V battery

(This assumption is reasonable if the plate separation is small

Solution The electric ﬁeld is directed from the positive
plate (A) to the negative one (B ), and the positive plate is at
a higher electric potential than the negative plate is. The potential difference between the plates must equal the potential
difference between the battery terminals. We can understand
this by noting that all points on a conductor in equilibrium
are at the same electric potential1; no potential difference exists between a terminal and any portion of the plate to which
it is connected. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld
between the plates is, from Equation 25.6,

The negative sign means the potential energy of the proton
decreases as it moves in the direction of the electric ﬁeld. As
the proton accelerates in the direction of the ﬁeld, it gains kinetic energy and at the same time loses electric potential energy (because energy is conserved).
Use the concept of conservation of energy to ﬁnd
the speed of the proton at point B.

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL ENERGY
DUE TO POINT CHARGES

Consider an isolated positive point charge q. Recall that such a charge produces an
electric ﬁeld that is directed radially outward from the charge. To ﬁnd the electric
potential at a point located a distance r from the charge, we begin with the general expression for potential difference:

where A and B are the two arbitrary points shown in Figure 25.6. At any ﬁeld

is a unit vector directed from the charge toward the ﬁeld point. The quantity E ⴢ ds

the angle between r̂ and d s. Furthermore, d s cos
is the projection of d s
onto r; thus, ds cos  dr. That is, any displacement d s along the path from
point A to point B produces a change dr in the magnitude of r, the radial
distance to the charge creating the ﬁeld. Making these substitutions, we ﬁnd
that E ⴢ ds  (k e q/r 2 )dr; hence, the expression for the potential difference becomes

The integral of E ⴢ ds is independent of the path between points A and B — as it must
be because the electric ﬁeld of a point charge is conservative. Furthermore, Equation 25.10 expresses the important result that the potential difference between any
two points A and B in a ﬁeld created by a point charge depends only on the radial
coordinates rA and rB . It is customary to choose the reference of electric potential
to be zero at r A  . With this reference, the electric potential created by a point

Electric potential is graphed in Figure 25.7 as a function of r, the radial distance from a positive charge in the xy plane. Consider the following analogy to
gravitational potential: Imagine trying to roll a marble toward the top of a hill
shaped like Figure 25.7a. The gravitational force experienced by the marble is
analogous to the repulsive force experienced by a positively charged object as it
approaches another positively charged object. Similarly, the electric potential
graph of the region surrounding a negative charge is analogous to a “hole” with
respect to any approaching positively charged objects. A charged object must be
inﬁnitely distant from another charge before the surface is “ﬂat” and has an electric potential of zero.

A spherical balloon contains a positively charged object at its center. As the balloon is inﬂated to a greater volume while the charged object remains at the center, does the electric
potential at the surface of the balloon increase, decrease, or remain the same? How about
the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld? The electric ﬂux?

Electric potential due to several
point charges

We obtain the electric potential resulting from two or more point charges by
applying the superposition principle. That is, the total electric potential at some
point P due to several point charges is the sum of the potentials due to the individual charges. For a group of point charges, we can write the total electric potential
at P in the form
qi
V  ke
(25.12)
i ri

Electric potential energy due to
two charges

where the potential is again taken to be zero at inﬁnity and ri is the distance from
the point P to the charge qi . Note that the sum in Equation 25.12 is an algebraic
sum of scalars rather than a vector sum (which we use to calculate the electric ﬁeld
of a group of charges). Thus, it is often much easier to evaluate V than to evaluate
E. The electric potential around a dipole is illustrated in Figure 25.8.
We now consider the potential energy of a system of two charged particles. If
V1 is the electric potential at a point P due to charge q1 , then the work an external
agent must do to bring a second charge q 2 from inﬁnity to P without acceleration
is q 2V1. By deﬁnition, this work equals the potential energy U of the two-particle
system when the particles are separated by a distance r 12 (Fig. 25.9). Therefore, we
can express the potential energy as2
q q
U  ke 1 2
(25.13)
r 12
Note that if the charges are of the same sign, U is positive. This is consistent with
the fact that positive work must be done by an external agent on the system to
bring the two charges near one another (because like charges repel). If the
charges are of opposite sign, U is negative; this means that negative work must be
done against the attractive force between the unlike charges for them to be
brought near each other.
If more than two charged particles are in the system, we can obtain the total
potential energy by calculating U for every pair of charges and summing the terms
algebraically. As an example, the total potential energy of the system of three
charges shown in Figure 25.10 is

q 1q 3

(25.14)

Physically, we can interpret this as follows: Imagine that q 1 is ﬁxed at the position
shown in Figure 25.10 but that q 2 and q 3 are at inﬁnity. The work an external
agent must do to bring q 2 from inﬁnity to its position near q 1 is k eq 1q 2/r 12 , which
is the ﬁrst term in Equation 25.14. The last two terms represent the work required
to bring q 3 from inﬁnity to its position near q 1 and q 2 . (The result is independent
of the order in which the charges are transported.)

The expression for the electric potential energy of a system made up of two point charges, Equation
25.13, is of the same form as the equation for the gravitational potential energy of a system made up of
two point masses, Gm1 m 2 /r (see Chapter 14). The similarity is not surprising in view of the fact that
both expressions are derived from an inverse-square force law.

OBTAINING THE VALUE OF THE ELECTRIC FIELD
FROM THE ELECTRIC POTENTIAL

The electric ﬁeld E and the electric potential V are related as shown in Equation
25.3. We now show how to calculate the value of the electric ﬁeld if the electric potential is known in a certain region.
From Equation 25.3 we can express the potential difference dV between two
points a distance ds apart as
dV   E ⴢ ds
(25.15)
If the electric ﬁeld has only one component E x , then E ⴢ ds  E x dx. Therefore,
Equation 25.15 becomes dV  E x dx, or

25.4 Obtaining the Value of the Electric Field from the Electric Potential

That is, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the direction of some coordinate is
equal to the negative of the derivative of the electric potential with respect to that
coordinate. Recall from the discussion following Equation 25.8 that the electric
potential does not change for any displacement perpendicular to an electric ﬁeld.
This is consistent with the notion, developed in Section 25.2, that equipotential
surfaces are perpendicular to the ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 25.12. A small positive
charge placed at rest on an electric ﬁeld line begins to move along the direction of
E because that is the direction of the force exerted on the charge by the charge
distribution creating the electric ﬁeld (and hence is the direction of a). Because
the charge starts with zero velocity, it moves in the direction of the change in velocity — that is, in the direction of a. In Figures 25.12a and 25.12b, a charge placed
at rest in the ﬁeld will move in a straight line because its acceleration vector is always parallel to its velocity vector. The magnitude of v increases, but its direction
does not change. The situation is different in Figure 25.12c. A positive charge
placed at some point near the dipole ﬁrst moves in a direction parallel to E at that
point. Because the direction of the electric ﬁeld is different at different locations,
however, the force acting on the charge changes direction, and a is no longer parallel to v. This causes the moving charge to change direction and speed, but it
does not necessarily follow the electric ﬁeld lines. Recall that it is not the velocity
vector but rather the acceleration vector that is proportional to force.
If the charge distribution creating an electric ﬁeld has spherical symmetry
such that the volume charge density depends only on the radial distance r, then
the electric ﬁeld is radial. In this case, E ⴢ ds  E r dr, and thus we can express dV
in the form dV  E r dr. Therefore,
Er  

dV
dr

(25.17)

For example, the electric potential of a point charge is V  k e q/r. Because V is a
function of r only, the potential function has spherical symmetry. Applying Equation 25.17, we ﬁnd that the electric ﬁeld due to the point charge is E r  k e q/r 2, a
familiar result. Note that the potential changes only in the radial direction, not in

any direction perpendicular to r. Thus, V (like E r ) is a function only of r. Again,
this is consistent with the idea that equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to
ﬁeld lines. In this case the equipotential surfaces are a family of spheres concentric with the spherically symmetric charge distribution (Fig. 25.12b).
The equipotential surfaces for an electric dipole are sketched in Figure
25.12c. When a test charge undergoes a displacement ds along an equipotential
surface, then dV  0 because the potential is constant along an equipotential surface. From Equation 25.15, then, dV  E ⴢ ds  0 ; thus, E must be perpendicular to the displacement along the equipotential surface. This shows that the
equipotential surfaces must always be perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld lines.
In general, the electric potential is a function of all three spatial coordinates.
If V(r) is given in terms of the cartesian coordinates, the electric ﬁeld components
E x , E y , and E z can readily be found from V(x, y, z) as the partial derivatives3

ELECTRIC POTENTIAL DUE TO CONTINUOUS CHARGE
DISTRIBUTIONS

dq

We can calculate the electric potential due to a continuous charge distribution in
two ways. If the charge distribution is known, we can start with Equation 25.11 for
the electric potential of a point charge. We then consider the potential due to a
small charge element dq, treating this element as a point charge (Fig. 25.14). The
electric potential dV at some point P due to the charge element dq is
dV  k e

dq
r

r

(25.18)

Figure 25.14

The electric potential at the point P due to a continuous charge distribution can be calculated by dividing the charged
body into segments of charge dq
and summing the electric potential
contributions over all segments.

where r is the distance from the charge element to point P. To obtain the total potential at point P, we integrate Equation 25.18 to include contributions from all elements of the charge distribution. Because each element is, in general, a different
distance from point P and because ke is constant, we can express V as
V  ke

冕

dq
r

(25.19)

In effect, we have replaced the sum in Equation 25.12 with an integral. Note that
this expression for V uses a particular reference: The electric potential is taken to
be zero when point P is inﬁnitely far from the charge distribution.
If the electric ﬁeld is already known from other considerations, such as Gauss’s
law, we can calculate the electric potential due to a continuous charge distribution
using Equation 25.3. If the charge distribution is highly symmetric, we ﬁrst evaluate E at any point using Gauss’s law and then substitute the value obtained into
Equation 25.3 to determine the potential difference V between any two points.
We then choose the electric potential V to be zero at some convenient point.
We illustrate both methods with several examples.

Electric Potential Due to a Uniformly Charged Ring

(a) Find an expression for the electric potential at a point P
located on the perpendicular central axis of a uniformly
charged ring of radius a and total charge Q.

Solution Let us orient the ring so that its plane is perpendicular to an x axis and its center is at the origin. We can then
take point P to be at a distance x from the center of the ring,
as shown in Figure 25.15. The charge element dq is at a distance !x 2 a 2 from point P. Hence, we can express V as

Electric Potential Due to a Uniformly Charged Disk

Find (a) the electric potential and (b) the magnitude of the
electric ﬁeld along the perpendicular central axis of a uniformly charged disk of radius a and surface charge density .

Solution (a) Again, we choose the point P to be at a distance x from the center of the disk and take the plane of the
disk to be perpendicular to the x axis. We can simplify the
problem by dividing the disk into a series of charged rings.
The electric potential of each ring is given by Equation 25.20.
Consider one such ring of radius r and width dr, as indicated
in Figure 25.16. The surface area of the ring is dA  2r dr ;

from the deﬁnition of surface charge density (see Section
23.5), we know that the charge on the ring is dq 

In Section 24.4 we found that when a solid conductor in equilibrium carries a net
charge, the charge resides on the outer surface of the conductor. Furthermore, we
showed that the electric ﬁeld just outside the conductor is perpendicular to the
surface and that the ﬁeld inside is zero.
We now show that every point on the surface of a charged conductor in
equilibrium is at the same electric potential. Consider two points A and B on
the surface of a charged conductor, as shown in Figure 25.20. Along a surface path
connecting these points, E is always perpendicular to the displacement ds; there-

all of the charge resides at the surface, E  0 inside the conductor, and the direction of E just outside the conductor is perpendicular to the surface. The electric potential is constant inside
the conductor and is equal to the potential at the surface. Note
from the spacing of the plus signs that the surface charge density
is nonuniform.

E ⴢ ds  0

This result applies to any two points on the surface. Therefore, V is constant everywhere on the surface of a charged conductor in equilibrium. That is,
the surface of any charged conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is an equipotential surface. Furthermore, because the electric ﬁeld is zero inside the conductor, we conclude from the relationship E r  dV/dr that the electric potential is constant everywhere inside the conductor and equal to its value at the
surface.
Because this is true about the electric potential, no work is required to move a test
charge from the interior of a charged conductor to its surface.
Consider a solid metal conducting sphere of radius R and total positive charge
Q , as shown in Figure 25.21a. The electric ﬁeld outside the sphere is ke Q /r 2 and
points radially outward. From Example 25.8, we know that the electric potential at
the interior and surface of the sphere must be ke Q /R relative to inﬁnity. The potential outside the sphere is ke Q /r. Figure 25.21b is a plot of the electric potential
as a function of r, and Figure 25.21c shows how the electric ﬁeld varies with r.
When a net charge is placed on a spherical conductor, the surface charge density is uniform, as indicated in Figure 25.21a. However, if the conductor is nonspherical, as in Figure 25.20, the surface charge density is high where the radius of
curvature is small and the surface is convex (as noted in Section 24.4), and it is low
where the radius of curvature is small and the surface is concave. Because the electric ﬁeld just outside the conductor is proportional to the surface charge density,
we see that the electric ﬁeld is large near convex points having small radii of
curvature and reaches very high values at sharp points.
Figure 25.22 shows the electric ﬁeld lines around two spherical conductors:
one carrying a net charge Q , and a larger one carrying zero net charge. In this
case, the surface charge density is not uniform on either conductor. The sphere
having zero net charge has negative charges induced on its side that faces the

perpendicular to the ﬁeld lines everywhere. Trying to move a positive charge in
the region of these conductors would be like moving a marble on a hill that is ﬂat
on top (representing the conductor on the left) and has another ﬂat area partway
down the side of the hill (representing the conductor on the right).

EXAMPLE 25.9

Two Connected Charged Spheres

Two spherical conductors of radii r 1 and r 2 are separated by a
distance much greater than the radius of either sphere. The
spheres are connected by a conducting wire, as shown in Figure 25.23. The charges on the spheres in equilibrium are q 1
and q 2 , respectively, and they are uniformly charged. Find
the ratio of the magnitudes of the electric ﬁelds at the surfaces of the spheres.

Therefore, the ratio of charges is

A Cavity Within a Conductor
Now consider a conductor of arbitrary shape containing a cavity as shown in Figure 25.24. Let us assume that no charges are inside the cavity. In this case, the
electric ﬁeld inside the cavity must be zero regardless of the charge distribution on the outside surface of the conductor. Furthermore, the ﬁeld in the cavity is
zero even if an electric ﬁeld exists outside the conductor.
To prove this point, we use the fact that every point on the conductor is at the
same electric potential, and therefore any two points A and B on the surface of the
cavity must be at the same potential. Now imagine that a ﬁeld E exists in the cavity
and evaluate the potential difference VB  VA deﬁned by Equation 25.3:
VB  VA  

冕

B

A

E ⴢ ds

If E is nonzero, we can always ﬁnd a path between A and B for which E ⴢ ds is a
positive number; thus, the integral must be positive. However, because
VB  VA  0, the integral of E ⴢ ds must be zero for all paths between any two
points on the conductor, which implies that E is zero everywhere. This contradiction can be reconciled only if E is zero inside the cavity. Thus, we conclude that a
cavity surrounded by conducting walls is a ﬁeld-free region as long as no charges
are inside the cavity.

Corona Discharge
A phenomenon known as corona discharge is often observed near a conductor
such as a high-voltage power line. When the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of the conductor is sufﬁciently strong, electrons are stripped from air molecules. This causes
the molecules to be ionized, thereby increasing the air’s ability to conduct. The
observed glow (or corona discharge) results from the recombination of free electrons with the ionized air molecules. If a conductor has an irregular shape, the
electric ﬁeld can be very high near sharp points or edges of the conductor; consequently, the ionization process and corona discharge are most likely to occur
around such points.

electric potential is not zero? (b) Can the electric potential be zero where the electric ﬁeld

THE MILLIKAN OIL-DROP EXPERIMENT

During the period from 1909 to 1913, Robert Millikan performed a brilliant set of
experiments in which he measured e, the elementary charge on an electron, and
demonstrated the quantized nature of this charge. His apparatus, diagrammed in
Figure 25.25, contains two parallel metallic plates. Charged oil droplets from an atomizer are allowed to pass through a small hole in the upper plate. A horizontally
directed light beam (not shown in the diagram) is used to illuminate the oil
droplets, which are viewed through a telescope whose long axis is at right angles to
the light beam. When the droplets are viewed in this manner, they appear as shining stars against a dark background, and the rate at which individual drops fall can
be determined.4
Let us assume that a single drop having a mass m and carrying a charge q is being viewed and that its charge is negative. If no electric ﬁeld is present between the
plates, the two forces acting on the charge are the force of gravity m g acting downward and a viscous drag force FD acting upward as indicated in Figure 25.26a. The
drag force is proportional to the drop’s speed. When the drop reaches its terminal
speed v, the two forces balance each other (mg  FD ).
Now suppose that a battery connected to the plates sets up an electric ﬁeld between the plates such that the upper plate is at the higher electric potential. In this
case, a third force qE acts on the charged drop. Because q is negative and E is directed downward, this electric force is directed upward, as shown in Figure 25.26b.
If this force is sufﬁciently great, the drop moves upward and the drag force FD acts
downward. When the upward electric force q E balances the sum of the gravitational force and the downward drag force FD , the drop reaches a new terminal
speed v in the upward direction.
With the ﬁeld turned on, a drop moves slowly upward, typically at rates of hundredths of a centimeter per second. The rate of fall in the absence of a ﬁeld is
comparable. Hence, one can follow a single droplet for hours, alternately rising
and falling, by simply turning the electric ﬁeld on and off.

APPLICATIONS OF ELECTROSTATICS
Hollow conductor

The practical application of electrostatics is represented by such devices as lightning rods and electrostatic precipitators and by such processes as xerography and
the painting of automobiles. Scientiﬁc devices based on the principles of electrostatics include electrostatic generators, the ﬁeld-ion microscope, and ion-drive
rocket engines.

The Van de Graaff Generator

+

+
+

In Section 24.5 we described an experiment that demonstrates a method for transferring charge to a hollow conductor (the Faraday ice-pail experiment). When a
charged conductor is placed in contact with the inside of a hollow conductor, all
of the charge of the charged conductor is transferred to the hollow conductor. In
principle, the charge on the hollow conductor and its electric potential can be increased without limit by repetition of the process.
In 1929 Robert J. Van de Graaff (1901 – 1967) used this principle to design and
build an electrostatic generator. This type of generator is used extensively in nuclear physics research. A schematic representation of the generator is given in Figure 25.27. Charge is delivered continuously to a high-potential electrode by means
of a moving belt of insulating material. The high-voltage electrode is a hollow conductor mounted on an insulating column. The belt is charged at point A by means
of a corona discharge between comb-like metallic needles and a grounded grid.
The needles are maintained at a positive electric potential of typically 104 V. The
positive charge on the moving belt is transferred to the hollow conductor by a second comb of needles at point B. Because the electric ﬁeld inside the hollow conductor is negligible, the positive charge on the belt is easily transferred to the conductor regardless of its potential. In practice, it is possible to increase the electric
potential of the hollow conductor until electrical discharge occurs through the air.
Because the “breakdown” electric ﬁeld in air is about 3  106 V/m, a sphere 1 m
in radius can be raised to a maximum potential of 3  106 V. The potential can be
increased further by increasing the radius of the hollow conductor and by placing
the entire system in a container ﬁlled with high-pressure gas.
Van de Graaff generators can produce potential differences as large as 20 million volts. Protons accelerated through such large potential differences receive
enough energy to initiate nuclear reactions between themselves and various target
nuclei. Smaller generators are often seen in science classrooms and museums. If a
person insulated from the ground touches the sphere of a Van de Graaff generator, his or her body can be brought to a high electric potential. The hair acquires a
net positive charge, and each strand is repelled by all the others. The result is a

scene such as that depicted in the photograph at the beginning of this chapter. In
addition to being insulated from ground, the person holding the sphere is safe in
this demonstration because the total charge on the sphere is very small (on the order of 1 C). If this amount of charge accidentally passed from the sphere
through the person to ground, the corresponding current would do no harm.

The Electrostatic Precipitator

QuickLab
Sprinkle some salt and pepper on an
open dish and mix the two together.
Now pull a comb through your hair
several times and bring the comb to
within 1 cm of the salt and pepper.
What happens? How is what happens
here related to the operation of an
electrostatic precipitator?

One important application of electrical discharge in gases is the electrostatic precipitator. This device removes particulate matter from combustion gases, thereby reducing air pollution. Precipitators are especially useful in coal-burning power
plants and in industrial operations that generate large quantities of smoke. Current systems are able to eliminate more than 99% of the ash from smoke.
Figure 25.28a shows a schematic diagram of an electrostatic precipitator. A
high potential difference (typically 40 to 100 kV) is maintained between a wire
running down the center of a duct and the walls of the duct, which are grounded.
The wire is maintained at a negative electric potential with respect to the walls, so
the electric ﬁeld is directed toward the wire. The values of the ﬁeld near the wire
become high enough to cause a corona discharge around the wire; the discharge
ionizes some air molecules to form positive ions, electrons, and such negative ions
as O2. The air to be cleaned enters the duct and moves near the wire. As the electrons and negative ions created by the discharge are accelerated toward the outer
wall by the electric ﬁeld, the dirt particles in the air become charged by collisions
and ion capture. Because most of the charged dirt particles are negative, they too
are drawn to the duct walls by the electric ﬁeld. When the duct is periodically
shaken, the particles break loose and are collected at the bottom.

In addition to reducing the level of particulate matter in the atmosphere
(compare Figs. 25.28b and c), the electrostatic precipitator recovers valuable materials in the form of metal oxides.

Xerography and Laser Printers
The basic idea of xerography5 was developed by Chester Carlson, who was granted
a patent for the xerographic process in 1940. The one feature of this process that
makes it unique is the use of a photoconductive material to form an image. (A photoconductor is a material that is a poor electrical conductor in the dark but that becomes a good electrical conductor when exposed to light.)
The xerographic process is illustrated in Figure 25.29a to d. First, the surface
of a plate or drum that has been coated with a thin ﬁlm of photoconductive material (usually selenium or some compound of selenium) is given a positive electrostatic charge in the dark. An image of the page to be copied is then focused by a lens
onto the charged surface. The photoconducting surface becomes conducting only
in areas where light strikes it. In these areas, the light produces charge carriers in
the photoconductor that move the positive charge off the drum. However, positive

surface and given a positive charge. This transfers the image to the paper as the negatively
charged powder particles migrate to the paper. The paper is then heat-treated to “ﬁx” the powder. (e) A laser printer operates similarly except the image is produced by turning a laser beam
on and off as it sweeps across the selenium-coated drum.

charges remain on those areas of the photoconductor not exposed to light,
leaving a latent image of the object in the form of a positive surface charge distribution.
Next, a negatively charged powder called a toner is dusted onto the photoconducting surface. The charged powder adheres only to those areas of the surface
that contain the positively charged image. At this point, the image becomes visible.
The toner (and hence the image) are then transferred to the surface of a sheet of
positively charged paper.
Finally, the toner is “ﬁxed” to the surface of the paper as the toner melts while
passing through high-temperature rollers. This results in a permanent copy of the
original.
A laser printer (Fig. 25.29e) operates by the same principle, with the exception that a computer-directed laser beam is used to illuminate the photoconductor
instead of a lens.

Problem-Solving Hints
Calculating Electric Potential
• Remember that electric potential is a scalar quantity, so components need
not be considered. Therefore, when using the superposition principle to
evaluate the electric potential at a point due to a system of point charges,
simply take the algebraic sum of the potentials due to the various charges.
However, you must keep track of signs. The potential is positive for positive
charges, and it is negative for negative charges.
• Just as with gravitational potential energy in mechanics, only changes in electric potential are signiﬁcant; hence, the point where you choose the poten-

Electric Potential

tial to be zero is arbitrary. When dealing with point charges or a charge distribution of ﬁnite size, we usually deﬁne V  0 to be at a point inﬁnitely far
from the charges.
• You can evaluate the electric potential at some point P due to a continuous
distribution of charge by dividing the charge distribution into inﬁnitesimal
elements of charge dq located at a distance r from P. Then, treat one charge
element as a point charge, such that the potential at P due to the element is
dV  ke dq/r. Obtain the total potential at P by integrating dV over the entire charge distribution. In performing the integration for most problems,
you must express dq and r in terms of a single variable. To simplify the integration, consider the geometry involved in the problem carefully. Review Examples 25.5 through 25.7 for guidance.
• Another method that you can use to obtain the electric potential due to a ﬁnite continuous charge distribution is to start with the deﬁnition of potential difference given by Equation 25.3. If you know or can easily obtain E
(from Gauss’s law), then you can evaluate the line integral of E ⴢ ds. An example of this method is given in Example 25.8.
• Once you know the electric potential at a point, you can obtain the electric
ﬁeld at that point by remembering that the electric ﬁeld component in
a speciﬁed direction is equal to the negative of the derivative of the electric
potential in that direction. Example 25.4 illustrates this procedure.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
electric potential is zero at the center of the dipole, but
the magnitude of the ﬁeld at that point is not zero. (The
two charges in a dipole are by deﬁnition of opposite
sign; thus, the electric ﬁeld lines created by the two
charges extend from the positive to the negative charge
and do not cancel anywhere.) This is the situation we
presented in Example 25.4c, in which the equations we
obtained give V  0 and E x  0.

what we do in the next section.) In general, however, an
electric ﬁeld changes from one place to another.
25.2 B : C, C : D, A : B, D : E. Moving from B to C decreases the electric potential by 2 V, so the electric ﬁeld
performs 2 J of work on each coulomb of charge that
moves. Moving from C to D decreases the electric potential by 1 V, so 1 J of work is done by the ﬁeld. It takes no
work to move the charge from A to B because the electric potential does not change. Moving from D to E increases the electric potential by 1 V, and thus the ﬁeld
does  1 J of work, just as raising a mass to a higher elevation causes the gravitational ﬁeld to do negative work
on the mass.
25.3 The electric potential decreases in inverse proportion to
the radius (see Eq. 25.11). The electric ﬁeld magnitude
decreases as the reciprocal of the radius squared (see
Eq. 23.4). Because the surface area increases as r 2 while
the electric ﬁeld magnitude decreases as 1/r 2, the electric ﬂux through the surface remains constant (see
Eq. 24.1).

not zero. This is also the situation inside a charged conductor. (b) Yes again. In Figure 25.8, for instance, the

Capacitance and Dielectrics

I

n this chapter, we discuss capacitors — devices that store electric charge. Capacitors are commonly used in a variety of electric circuits. For instance, they are
used to tune the frequency of radio receivers, as ﬁlters in power supplies, to
eliminate sparking in automobile ignition systems, and as energy-storing devices in
electronic ﬂash units.
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. We shall see
that the capacitance of a given capacitor depends on its geometry and on the material — called a dielectric — that separates the conductors.

26.1
13.5

DEFINITION OF CAPACITANCE

Consider two conductors carrying charges of equal magnitude but of opposite
sign, as shown in Figure 26.1. Such a combination of two conductors is called a capacitor. The conductors are called plates. A potential difference ⌬V exists between
the conductors due to the presence of the charges. Because the unit of potential
difference is the volt, a potential difference is often called a voltage. We shall use
this term to describe the potential difference across a circuit element or between
two points in space.
What determines how much charge is on the plates of a capacitor for a given
voltage? In other words, what is the capacity of the device for storing charge at a
particular value of ⌬V ? Experiments show that the quantity of charge Q on a capacitor 1 is linearly proportional to the potential difference between the conductors; that is, Q ⬀ ⌬V. The proportionality constant depends on the shape and separation of the conductors.2 We can write this relationship as Q ⫽ C ⌬V if we deﬁne
capacitance as follows:

Deﬁnition of capacitance

The capacitance C of a capacitor is the ratio of the magnitude of the charge on
either conductor to the magnitude of the potential difference between them:
C⬅

–Q

Q
⌬V

(26.1)

Note that by deﬁnition capacitance is always a positive quantity. Furthermore, the potential difference ⌬V is always expressed in Equation 26.1 as a positive quantity. Because the potential difference increases linearly with the stored charge, the ratio
Q /⌬V is constant for a given capacitor. Therefore, capacitance is a measure of a
capacitor’s ability to store charge and electric potential energy.
From Equation 26.1, we see that capacitance has SI units of coulombs per volt.
The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), which was named in honor of Michael
Faraday:
1 F ⫽ 1 C/V

+Q

Figure 26.1

A capacitor consists
of two conductors carrying charges
of equal magnitude but opposite
sign.

The farad is a very large unit of capacitance. In practice, typical devices have capacitances ranging from microfarads (10⫺6 F) to picofarads (10⫺12 F). For practical purposes, capacitors often are labeled “mF” for microfarads and “mmF” for micromicrofarads or, equivalently, “pF” for picofarads.

Although the total charge on the capacitor is zero (because there is as much excess positive charge
on one conductor as there is excess negative charge on the other), it is common practice to refer to the
magnitude of the charge on either conductor as “the charge on the capacitor.”

The proportionality between ⌬V and Q can be proved from Coulomb’s law or by experiment.

Area = A

A collection of capacitors used in a variety of applications.

Let us consider a capacitor formed from a pair of parallel plates, as shown in
Figure 26.2. Each plate is connected to one terminal of a battery (not shown in
Fig. 26.2), which acts as a source of potential difference. If the capacitor is initially
uncharged, the battery establishes an electric ﬁeld in the connecting wires when
the connections are made. Let us focus on the plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery. The electric ﬁeld applies a force on electrons in the wire just
outside this plate; this force causes the electrons to move onto the plate. This
movement continues until the plate, the wire, and the terminal are all at the same
electric potential. Once this equilibrium point is attained, a potential difference
no longer exists between the terminal and the plate, and as a result no electric
ﬁeld is present in the wire, and the movement of electrons stops. The plate now
carries a negative charge. A similar process occurs at the other capacitor plate,
with electrons moving from the plate to the wire, leaving the plate positively
charged. In this ﬁnal conﬁguration, the potential difference across the capacitor
plates is the same as that between the terminals of the battery.
Suppose that we have a capacitor rated at 4 pF. This rating means that the capacitor can store 4 pC of charge for each volt of potential difference between the
two conductors. If a 9-V battery is connected across this capacitor, one of the conductors ends up with a net charge of ⫺ 36 pC and the other ends up with a net
charge of ⫹ 36 pC.

Figure 26.2 A parallel-plate capacitor consists of two parallel conducting plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. When the
capacitor is charged, the plates
carry equal amounts of charge.
One plate carries positive charge,
and the other carries negative
charge.

CALCULATING CAPACITANCE

We can calculate the capacitance of a pair of oppositely charged conductors in the
following manner: We assume a charge of magnitude Q , and we calculate the potential difference using the techniques described in the preceding chapter. We
then use the expression C ⫽ Q /⌬V to evaluate the capacitance. As we might expect, we can perform this calculation relatively easily if the geometry of the capacitor is simple.
We can calculate the capacitance of an isolated spherical conductor of radius
R and charge Q if we assume that the second conductor making up the capacitor is
a concentric hollow sphere of inﬁnite radius. The electric potential of the sphere
of radius R is simply ke Q /R, and setting V ⫽ 0 at inﬁnity as usual, we have

This expression shows that the capacitance of an isolated charged sphere is proportional to its radius and is independent of both the charge on the sphere and
the potential difference.

CHAPTER 26

Capacitance and Dielectrics

The capacitance of a pair of conductors depends on the geometry of the conductors. Let us illustrate this with three familiar geometries, namely, parallel
plates, concentric cylinders, and concentric spheres. In these examples, we assume
that the charged conductors are separated by a vacuum. The effect of a dielectric
material placed between the conductors is treated in Section 26.5.

Parallel-Plate Capacitors
Two parallel metallic plates of equal area A are separated by a distance d, as shown
in Figure 26.2. One plate carries a charge Q , and the other carries a charge ⫺Q .
Let us consider how the geometry of these conductors inﬂuences the capacity of
the combination to store charge. Recall that charges of like sign repel one another. As a capacitor is being charged by a battery, electrons ﬂow into the negative
plate and out of the positive plate. If the capacitor plates are large, the accumulated charges are able to distribute themselves over a substantial area, and the
amount of charge that can be stored on a plate for a given potential difference increases as the plate area is increased. Thus, we expect the capacitance to be proportional to the plate area A.
Now let us consider the region that separates the plates. If the battery has a
constant potential difference between its terminals, then the electric ﬁeld between
the plates must increase as d is decreased. Let us imagine that we move the plates
closer together and consider the situation before any charges have had a chance
to move in response to this change. Because no charges have moved, the electric
ﬁeld between the plates has the same value but extends over a shorter distance.
Thus, the magnitude of the potential difference between the plates ⌬V ⫽ Ed (Eq.
25.6) is now smaller. The difference between this new capacitor voltage and the
terminal voltage of the battery now exists as a potential difference across the wires
connecting the battery to the capacitor. This potential difference results in an electric ﬁeld in the wires that drives more charge onto the plates, increasing the potential difference between the plates. When the potential difference between the
plates again matches that of the battery, the potential difference across the wires
falls back to zero, and the ﬂow of charge stops. Thus, moving the plates closer together causes the charge on the capacitor to increase. If d is increased, the charge
decreases. As a result, we expect the device’s capacitance to be inversely proportional to d.

26.2 Calculating Capacitance

We can verify these physical arguments with the following derivation. The surface charge density on either plate is ␴ ⫽ Q /A. If the plates are very close together (in comparison with their length and width), we can assume that the electric ﬁeld is uniform between the plates and is zero elsewhere. According to the last
paragraph of Example 24.8, the value of the electric ﬁeld between the plates is

That is, the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is proportional to the
area of its plates and inversely proportional to the plate separation, just as
we expect from our conceptual argument.
A careful inspection of the electric ﬁeld lines for a parallel-plate capacitor reveals that the ﬁeld is uniform in the central region between the plates, as shown in
Figure 26.3a. However, the ﬁeld is nonuniform at the edges of the plates. Figure
26.3b is a photograph of the electric ﬁeld pattern of a parallel-plate capacitor.
Note the nonuniform nature of the electric ﬁeld at the ends of the plates. Such
end effects can be neglected if the plate separation is small compared with the
length of the plates.

Capacitance and Dielectrics

Cylindrical and Spherical Capacitors
From the deﬁnition of capacitance, we can, in principle, ﬁnd the capacitance of
any geometric arrangement of conductors. The following examples demonstrate
the use of this deﬁnition to calculate the capacitance of the other familiar geometries that we mentioned: cylinders and spheres.

EXAMPLE 26.2

The Cylindrical Capacitor

A solid cylindrical conductor of radius a and charge Q is
coaxial with a cylindrical shell of negligible thickness, radius
b ⬎ a, and charge ⫺Q (Fig. 26.5a). Find the capacitance of
this cylindrical capacitor if its length is ᐉ.

Solution It is difﬁcult to apply physical arguments to this
conﬁguration, although we can reasonably expect the capacitance to be proportional to the cylinder length ᐉ for the same
reason that parallel-plate capacitance is proportional to plate
area: Stored charges have more room in which to be distributed. If we assume that ᐉ is much greater than a and b, we can
neglect end effects. In this case, the electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the long axis of the cylinders and is conﬁned to the
region between them (Fig. 26.5b). We must ﬁrst calculate the
potential difference between the two cylinders, which is given
in general by

An example of this type of geometric arrangement is a coaxial
cable, which consists of two concentric cylindrical conductors
separated by an insulator. The cable carries electrical signals
in the inner and outer conductors. Such a geometry is especially useful for shielding the signals from any possible external inﬂuences.

electric ﬁeld of a cylindrical charge distribution having linear
charge density ␭ is E r ⫽ 2k e ␭ /r (Eq. 24.7). The same result
applies here because, according to Gauss’s law, the charge on
the outer cylinder does not contribute to the electric ﬁeld inside it. Using this result and noting from Figure 26.5b that E
is along r, we ﬁnd that

Equation 26.4, we see that the capacitance per unit length of
a combination of concentric cylindrical conductors is

COMBINATIONS OF CAPACITORS

Two or more capacitors often are combined in electric circuits. We can calculate
the equivalent capacitance of certain combinations using methods described in
this section. The circuit symbols for capacitors and batteries, as well as the color
codes used for them in this text, are given in Figure 26.7. The symbol for the capacitor reﬂects the geometry of the most common model for a capacitor — a pair
of parallel plates. The positive terminal of the battery is at the higher potential
and is represented in the circuit symbol by the longer vertical line.

Parallel Combination
Two capacitors connected as shown in Figure 26.8a are known as a parallel combination of capacitors. Figure 26.8b shows a circuit diagram for this combination of capacitors. The left plates of the capacitors are connected by a conducting wire to
the positive terminal of the battery and are therefore both at the same electric potential as the positive terminal. Likewise, the right plates are connected to the negative terminal and are therefore both at the same potential as the negative terminal. Thus, the individual potential differences across capacitors connected in
parallel are all the same and are equal to the potential difference applied
across the combination.
In a circuit such as that shown in Figure 26.8, the voltage applied across the
combination is the terminal voltage of the battery. Situations can occur in which

the parallel combination is in a circuit with other circuit elements; in such situations, we must determine the potential difference across the combination by analyzing the entire circuit.
When the capacitors are ﬁrst connected in the circuit shown in Figure 26.8,
electrons are transferred between the wires and the plates; this transfer leaves the
left plates positively charged and the right plates negatively charged. The energy
source for this charge transfer is the internal chemical energy stored in the battery, which is converted to electric potential energy associated with the charge separation. The ﬂow of charge ceases when the voltage across the capacitors is equal
to that across the battery terminals. The capacitors reach their maximum charge
when the ﬂow of charge ceases. Let us call the maximum charges on the two capacitors Q 1 and Q 2 . The total charge Q stored by the two capacitors is
Q ⫽ Q1 ⫹ Q2

(26.7)

That is, the total charge on capacitors connected in parallel is the sum of the
charges on the individual capacitors. Because the voltages across the capacitors
are the same, the charges that they carry are
Q 1 ⫽ C 1 ⌬V

Q 2 ⫽ C 2 ⌬V

Suppose that we wish to replace these two capacitors by one equivalent capacitor
having a capacitance C eq , as shown in Figure 26.8c. The effect this equivalent capacitor has on the circuit must be exactly the same as the effect of the combination of the two individual capacitors. That is, the equivalent capacitor must store Q
units of charge when connected to the battery. We can see from Figure 26.8c that
the voltage across the equivalent capacitor also is ⌬V because the equivalent capac-

26.3 Combinations of Capacitors

itor is connected directly across the battery terminals. Thus, for the equivalent capacitor,

we ﬁnd the equivalent capacitance to be

Thus, the equivalent capacitance of a parallel combination of capacitors is
greater than any of the individual capacitances. This makes sense because we
are essentially combining the areas of all the capacitor plates when we connect
them with conducting wire.

Series Combination
Two capacitors connected as shown in Figure 26.9a are known as a series combination of capacitors. The left plate of capacitor 1 and the right plate of capacitor 2
are connected to the terminals of a battery. The other two plates are connected to
each other and to nothing else; hence, they form an isolated conductor that is initially uncharged and must continue to have zero net charge. To analyze this combination, let us begin by considering the uncharged capacitors and follow what
happens just after a battery is connected to the circuit. When the battery is con-

nected, electrons are transferred out of the left plate of C 1 and into the right plate
of C 2 . As this negative charge accumulates on the right plate of C 2 , an equivalent
amount of negative charge is forced off the left plate of C 2 , and this left plate
therefore has an excess positive charge. The negative charge leaving the left plate
of C 2 travels through the connecting wire and accumulates on the right plate of
C 1 . As a result, all the right plates end up with a charge ⫺Q , and all the left plates
end up with a charge ⫹Q. Thus, the charges on capacitors connected in series
are the same.
From Figure 26.9a, we see that the voltage ⌬V across the battery terminals is
split between the two capacitors:
⌬V ⫽ ⌬V 1 ⫹ ⌬V 2

(26.9)

where ⌬V 1 and ⌬V 2 are the potential differences across capacitors C 1 and C 2 , respectively. In general, the total potential difference across any number of capacitors connected in series is the sum of the potential differences across
the individual capacitors.
Suppose that an equivalent capacitor has the same effect on the circuit as the
series combination. After it is fully charged, the equivalent capacitor must have a
charge of ⫺Q on its right plate and a charge of ⫹Q on its left plate. Applying the
deﬁnition of capacitance to the circuit in Figure 26.9b, we have

ENERGY STORED IN A CHARGED CAPACITOR

Almost everyone who works with electronic equipment has at some time veriﬁed
that a capacitor can store energy. If the plates of a charged capacitor are connected by a conductor, such as a wire, charge moves between the plates and the
connecting wire until the capacitor is uncharged. The discharge can often be observed as a visible spark. If you should accidentally touch the opposite plates of a
charged capacitor, your ﬁngers act as a pathway for discharge, and the result is an
electric shock. The degree of shock you receive depends on the capacitance and
on the voltage applied to the capacitor. Such a shock could be fatal if high voltages
are present, such as in the power supply of a television set. Because the charges
can be stored in a capacitor even when the set is turned off, unplugging the television does not make it safe to open the case and touch the components inside.
Consider a parallel-plate capacitor that is initially uncharged, such that the initial potential difference across the plates is zero. Now imagine that the capacitor is
connected to a battery and develops a maximum charge Q. (We assume that the
capacitor is charged slowly so that the problem can be considered as an electrostatic system.) When the capacitor is connected to the battery, electrons in the wire
just outside the plate connected to the negative terminal move into the plate to
give it a negative charge. Electrons in the plate connected to the positive terminal
move out of the plate into the wire to give the plate a positive charge. Thus,
charges move only a small distance in the wires.
To calculate the energy of the capacitor, we shall assume a different process —
one that does not actually occur but gives the same ﬁnal result. We can make this

814

assumption because the energy in the ﬁnal conﬁguration does not depend on the
actual charge-transfer process. We imagine that we reach in and grab a small
amount of positive charge on the plate connected to the negative terminal and apply a force that causes this positive charge to move over to the plate connected to
the positive terminal. Thus, we do work on the charge as we transfer it from one
plate to the other. At ﬁrst, no work is required to transfer a small amount of
charge dq from one plate to the other.3 However, once this charge has been transferred, a small potential difference exists between the plates. Therefore, work
must be done to move additional charge through this potential difference. As
more and more charge is transferred from one plate to the other, the potential difference increases in proportion, and more work is required.
Suppose that q is the charge on the capacitor at some instant during the
charging process. At the same instant, the potential difference across the capacitor
is ⌬V ⫽ q/C. From Section 25.2, we know that the work necessary to transfer an increment of charge dq from the plate carrying charge ⫺q to the plate carrying
charge q (which is at the higher electric potential) is

Here’s how to ﬁnd out whether your
calculator has a capacitor to protect
values or programs during battery
changes: Store a number in your calculator’s memory, remove the calculator battery for a moment, and then
quickly replace it. Was the number
that you stored preserved while the
battery was out of the calculator?

stored in the calculator before trying
this!)

This result applies to any capacitor, regardless of its geometry. We see that for a
given capacitance, the stored energy increases as the charge increases and as the
potential difference increases. In practice, there is a limit to the maximum energy

A plot of potential difference versus charge for
a capacitor is a straight line having a slope 1/C. The work required to move charge dq through the potential difference ⌬V

ﬁnal charge Q is the triangular area under the straight line,
W ⫽ 12 Q ⌬V . (Don’t forget that 1 V ⫽ 1 J/C; hence, the unit
for the area is the joule.)

3 We shall use lowercase q for the varying charge on the capacitor while it is charging, to distinguish it
from uppercase Q , which is the total charge on the capacitor after it is completely charged.

(or charge) that can be stored because, at a sufﬁciently great value of ⌬V, discharge ultimately occurs between the plates. For this reason, capacitors are usually
labeled with a maximum operating voltage.

Quick Quiz 26.3
You have three capacitors and a battery. How should you combine the capacitors and the
battery in one circuit so that the capacitors will store the maximum possible energy?

We can consider the energy stored in a capacitor as being stored in the electric ﬁeld created between the plates as the capacitor is charged. This description is
reasonable in view of the fact that the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the charge
on the capacitor. For a parallel-plate capacitor, the potential difference is related
to the electric ﬁeld through the relationship ⌬V ⫽ Ed. Furthermore, its capacitance is C ⫽ ⑀0 A/d (Eq. 26.3). Substituting these expressions into Equation 26.11,
we obtain

Energy stored in a parallel-plate

Because the volume V (volume, not voltage!) occupied by the electric ﬁeld is Ad,
the energy per unit volume u E ⫽ U/V ⫽ U/Ad, known as the energy density, is
u E ⫽ 12⑀0E 2

(26.13)

Although Equation 26.13 was derived for a parallel-plate capacitor, the expression
is generally valid. That is, the energy density in any electric ﬁeld is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at a given point.

This bank of capacitors stores electrical energy for use in the particle accelerator at
FermiLab, located outside Chicago. Because the electric utility company cannot
provide a large enough burst of energy to
operate the equipment, these capacitors
are slowly charged up, and then the energy
is rapidly “dumped” into the accelerator. In
this sense, the setup is much like a ﬁreprotection water tank on top of a building.
The tank collects water and stores it for situations in which a lot of water is needed in
a short time.

Repeat Quick Quiz 26.4, but this time answer the questions for the situation in which the
battery remains connected to the capacitor while you pull the plates apart.

One device in which capacitors have an important role is the deﬁbrillator (Fig.
26.13). Up to 360 J is stored in the electric ﬁeld of a large capacitor in a deﬁbrillator when it is fully charged. The deﬁbrillator can deliver all this energy to a patient
in about 2 ms. (This is roughly equivalent to 3 000 times the power output of a
60-W lightbulb!) The sudden electric shock stops the ﬁbrillation (random contractions) of the heart that often accompanies heart attacks and helps to restore the
correct rhythm.
A camera’s ﬂash unit also uses a capacitor, although the total amount of energy stored is much less than that stored in a deﬁbrillator. After the ﬂash unit’s capacitor is charged, tripping the camera’s shutter causes the stored energy to be
sent through a special lightbulb that brieﬂy illuminates the subject being photographed.

In a hospital
or at an emergency scene, you
might see a patient being revived with a deﬁbrillator. The
deﬁbrillator’s paddles are applied to the patient’s chest,
and an electric shock is sent
through the chest cavity. The
aim of this technique is to restore the heart’s normal
rhythm pattern.

CHAPTER 26

26.5

Capacitance and Dielectrics

CAPACITORS WITH DIELECTRICS

A dielectric is a nonconducting material, such as rubber, glass, or waxed paper.
When a dielectric is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance increases. If the dielectric completely ﬁlls the space between the plates, the capacitance increases by a dimensionless factor ␬, which is called the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant is a property of a material and varies from one
material to another. In this section, we analyze this change in capacitance in terms
of electrical parameters such as electric charge, electric ﬁeld, and potential difference; in Section 26.7, we shall discuss the microscopic origin of these changes.
We can perform the following experiment to illustrate the effect of a dielectric
in a capacitor: Consider a parallel-plate capacitor that without a dielectric has a
charge Q 0 and a capacitance C 0 . The potential difference across the capacitor is
⌬V 0 ⫽ Q 0 /C 0 . Figure 26.14a illustrates this situation. The potential difference is
measured by a voltmeter, which we shall study in greater detail in Chapter 28. Note
that no battery is shown in the ﬁgure; also, we must assume that no charge can
ﬂow through an ideal voltmeter, as we shall learn in Section 28.5. Hence, there is
no path by which charge can ﬂow and alter the charge on the capacitor. If a dielectric is now inserted between the plates, as shown in Figure 26.14b, the voltmeter
indicates that the voltage between the plates decreases to a value ⌬V. The voltages
with and without the dielectric are related by the factor ␬ as follows:
⌬V ⫽

⌬V 0
␬

Because ⌬V ⬍ ⌬V0 , we see that ␬ ⬎ 1.
Because the charge Q 0 on the capacitor does not change, we conclude that
the capacitance must change to the value
C⫽
The capacitance of a ﬁlled
capacitor is greater than that of an
empty one by a factor ␬.

(26.14)

That is, the capacitance increases by the factor ␬ when the dielectric completely ﬁlls
the region between the plates.4 For a parallel-plate capacitor, where C 0 ⫽ ⑀0 A/d
(Eq. 26.3), we can express the capacitance when the capacitor is ﬁlled with a dielectric as
⑀ A
C⫽␬ 0
(26.15)
d
From Equations 26.3 and 26.15, it would appear that we could make the capacitance very large by decreasing d, the distance between the plates. In practice,
the lowest value of d is limited by the electric discharge that could occur through
the dielectric medium separating the plates. For any given separation d, the maximum voltage that can be applied to a capacitor without causing a discharge depends on the dielectric strength (maximum electric ﬁeld) of the dielectric. If the
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the dielectric exceeds the dielectric strength,
then the insulating properties break down and the dielectric begins to conduct.
Insulating materials have values of ␬ greater than unity and dielectric strengths
4

If the dielectric is introduced while the potential difference is being maintained constant by a battery,
the charge increases to a value Q ⫽ ␬Q 0 . The additional charge is supplied by the battery, and the capacitance again increases by the factor ␬.

• Increase in capacitance
• Increase in maximum operating voltage
• Possible mechanical support between the plates, which allows the plates to be

close together without touching, thereby decreasing d and increasing C

Types of Capacitors
Commercial capacitors are often made from metallic foil interlaced with thin
sheets of either parafﬁn-impregnated paper or Mylar as the dielectric material.
These alternate layers of metallic foil and dielectric are rolled into a cylinder to
form a small package (Fig. 26.15a). High-voltage capacitors commonly consist of a
number of interwoven metallic plates immersed in silicone oil (Fig. 26.15b). Small
capacitors are often constructed from ceramic materials. Variable capacitors (typically 10 to 500 pF) usually consist of two interwoven sets of metallic plates, one
ﬁxed and the other movable, and contain air as the dielectric.
Often, an electrolytic capacitor is used to store large amounts of charge at relatively low voltages. This device, shown in Figure 26.15c, consists of a metallic foil in
contact with an electrolyte — a solution that conducts electricity by virtue of the motion of ions contained in the solution. When a voltage is applied between the foil
and the electrolyte, a thin layer of metal oxide (an insulator) is formed on the foil,

and this layer serves as the dielectric. Very large values of capacitance can be obtained in an electrolytic capacitor because the dielectric layer is very thin, and thus
the plate separation is very small.
Electrolytic capacitors are not reversible as are many other capacitors — they
have a polarity, which is indicated by positive and negative signs marked on the device. When electrolytic capacitors are used in circuits, the polarity must be aligned
properly. If the polarity of the applied voltage is opposite that which is intended,
the oxide layer is removed and the capacitor conducts electricity instead of storing
charge.

As we have seen, the energy of a capacitor not connected to a battery is lowered when a dielectric is inserted between the plates; this means that negative
work is done on the dielectric by the external agent inserting the dielectric into
the capacitor. This, in turn, implies that a force that draws it into the capacitor
must be acting on the dielectric. This force originates from the nonuniform nature of the electric ﬁeld of the capacitor near its edges, as indicated in Figure
26.18. The horizontal component of this fringe ﬁeld acts on the induced charges on
the surface of the dielectric, producing a net horizontal force directed into the
space between the capacitor plates.

ELECTRIC DIPOLE IN AN ELECTRIC FIELD

We have discussed the effect on the capacitance of placing a dielectric between the
plates of a capacitor. In Section 26.7, we shall describe the microscopic origin of
this effect. Before we can do so, however, we need to expand upon the discussion
of the electric dipole that we began in Section 23.4 (see Example 23.6). The electric dipole consists of two charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated
by a distance 2a, as shown in Figure 26.19. The electric dipole moment of this
conﬁguration is deﬁned as the vector p directed from ⫺q to ⫹ q along the line
joining the charges and having magnitude 2aq:
p ⬅ 2aq

(26.16)

Now suppose that an electric dipole is placed in a uniform electric ﬁeld E, as
shown in Figure 26.20. We identify E as the ﬁeld external to the dipole, distinguishing it from the ﬁeld due to the dipole, which we discussed in Section 23.4.
The ﬁeld E is established by some other charge distribution, and we place the dipole into this ﬁeld. Let us imagine that the dipole moment makes an angle ␪
with the ﬁeld.
The electric forces acting on the two charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction as shown in Figure 26.20 (each has a magnitude F ⫽ qE). Thus,
the net force on the dipole is zero. However, the two forces produce a net torque
on the dipole; as a result, the dipole rotates in the direction that brings the dipole
moment vector into greater alignment with the ﬁeld. The torque due to the force
on the positive charge about an axis through O in Figure 26.20 is Fa sin ␪, where
a sin ␪ is the moment arm of F about O. This force tends to produce a clockwise
rotation. The torque about O on the negative charge also is Fa sin ␪ ; here again,
the force tends to produce a clockwise rotation. Thus, the net torque about O is

(26.18)

We can determine the potential energy of the system of an electric dipole in
an external electric ﬁeld as a function of the orientation of the dipole with respect
to the ﬁeld. To do this, we recognize that work must be done by an external agent
to rotate the dipole through an angle so as to cause the dipole moment vector to
become less aligned with the ﬁeld. The work done is then stored as potential energy in the system of the dipole and the external ﬁeld. The work dW required to
rotate the dipole through an angle d␪ is dW ⫽ ␶ d␪ (Eq. 10.22). Because
␶ ⫽ pE sin ␪ and because the work is transformed into potential energy U, we ﬁnd
that, for a rotation from ␪i to ␪f , the change in potential energy is

The term that contains cos ␪i is a constant that depends on the initial orientation of the dipole. It is convenient for us to choose ␪i ⫽ 90⬚, so that cos ␪i ⫽ cos
90° ⫽ 0. Furthermore, let us choose U i ⫽ 0 at ␪i ⫽ 90⬚ as our reference of potential energy. Hence, we can express a general value of U ⫽ U f as
U ⫽ ⫺pE cos ␪

(26.19)

We can write this expression for the potential energy of a dipole in an electric ﬁeld
as the dot product of the vectors p and E:
Potential energy of a dipole in an

U ⫽ ⫺p ⴢ E

(26.20)

To develop a conceptual understanding of Equation 26.19, let us compare this
expression with the expression for the potential energy of an object in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth, U ⫽ mgh (see Chapter 8). The gravitational expression includes a parameter associated with the object we place in the ﬁeld — its mass m.
Likewise, Equation 26.19 includes a parameter of the object in the electric ﬁeld —
its dipole moment p. The gravitational expression includes the magnitude of the
gravitational ﬁeld g. Similarly, Equation 26.19 includes the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld E. So far, these two contributions to the potential energy expressions appear analogous. However, the ﬁnal contribution is somewhat different in the two
cases. In the gravitational expression, the potential energy depends on how high
we lift the object, measured by h. In Equation 26.19, the potential energy depends
on the angle ␪ through which we rotate the dipole. In both cases, we are making a
change in the system. In the gravitational case, the change involves moving an object in a translational sense, whereas in the electrical case, the change involves moving an object in a rotational sense. In both cases, however, once the change is
made, the system tends to return to the original conﬁguration when the object is
released: the object of mass m falls back to the ground, and the dipole begins to
rotate back toward the conﬁguration in which it was aligned with the ﬁeld. Thus,
apart from the type of motion, the expressions for potential energy in these two
cases are similar.

825

26.6 Electric Dipole in an Electric Field

Molecules are said to be polarized when a separation exists between the average
position of the negative charges and the average position of the positive charges in
the molecule. In some molecules, such as water, this condition is always present —
such molecules are called polar molecules. Molecules that do not possess a permanent polarization are called nonpolar molecules.
We can understand the permanent polarization of water by inspecting the
geometry of the water molecule. In the water molecule, the oxygen atom is
bonded to the hydrogen atoms such that an angle of 105° is formed between the
two bonds (Fig. 26.21). The center of the negative charge distribution is near the
oxygen atom, and the center of the positive charge distribution lies at a point midway along the line joining the hydrogen atoms (the point labeled ⫻ in Fig. 26.21).
We can model the water molecule and other polar molecules as dipoles because
the average positions of the positive and negative charges act as point charges. As a
result, we can apply our discussion of dipoles to the behavior of polar molecules.
Microwave ovens take advantage of the polar nature of the water molecule.
When in operation, microwave ovens generate a rapidly changing electric ﬁeld
that causes the polar molecules to swing back and forth, absorbing energy from
the ﬁeld in the process. Because the jostling molecules collide with each other, the
energy they absorb from the ﬁeld is converted to internal energy, which corresponds to an increase in temperature of the food.
Another household scenario in which the dipole structure of water is exploited is washing with soap and water. Grease and oil are made up of nonpolar
molecules, which are generally not attracted to water. Plain water is not very useful
for removing this type of grime. Soap contains long molecules called surfactants. In
a long molecule, the polarity characteristics of one end of the molecule can be different from those at the other end. In a surfactant molecule, one end acts like a
nonpolar molecule and the other acts like a polar molecule. The nonpolar end
can attach to a grease or oil molecule, and the polar end can attach to a water molecule. Thus, the soap serves as a chain, linking the dirt and water molecules together. When the water is rinsed away, the grease and oil go with it.
A symmetric molecule (Fig. 26.22a) has no permanent polarization, but polarization can be induced by placing the molecule in an electric ﬁeld. A ﬁeld directed
to the left, as shown in Figure 26.22b, would cause the center of the positive
charge distribution to shift to the left from its initial position and the center of the
negative charge distribution to shift to the right. This induced polarization is the effect that predominates in most materials used as dielectrics in capacitors.

is required to rotate the dipoles from this orientation

Solution The work required to rotate one molecule 90° is
equal to the difference in potential energy between the 90°
orientation and the 0° orientation. Using Equation 26.19, we

obtain

capacitor is reduced to ⌬V0 /␬ when a dielectric is introduced. Because the potential difference between the plates equals the product of the electric ﬁeld and the
separation d, the electric ﬁeld is also reduced. Thus, if E0 is the electric ﬁeld without the dielectric, the ﬁeld in the presence of a dielectric is

(26.21)

Let us ﬁrst consider a dielectric made up of polar molecules placed in the
electric ﬁeld between the plates of a capacitor. The dipoles (that is, the polar molecules making up the dielectric) are randomly oriented in the absence of an electric ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 26.23a. When an external ﬁeld E0 due to charges on
the capacitor plates is applied, a torque is exerted on the dipoles, causing them to
partially align with the ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 26.23b. We can now describe the
dielectric as being polarized. The degree of alignment of the molecules with the
electric ﬁeld depends on temperature and on the magnitude of the ﬁeld. In general, the alignment increases with decreasing temperature and with increasing
electric ﬁeld.
If the molecules of the dielectric are nonpolar, then the electric ﬁeld due to
the plates produces some charge separation and an induced dipole moment. These
induced dipole moments tend to align with the external ﬁeld, and the dielectric is
polarized. Thus, we can polarize a dielectric with an external ﬁeld regardless of
whether the molecules are polar or nonpolar.
With these ideas in mind, consider a slab of dielectric material placed between
the plates of a capacitor so that it is in a uniform electric ﬁeld E0 , as shown in Figure 26.24a. The electric ﬁeld due to the plates is directed to the right and polarizes the dielectric. The net effect on the dielectric is the formation of an induced
positive surface charge density ␴ind on the right face and an equal negative surface
charge density ⫺ ␴ind on the left face, as shown in Figure 26.24b. These induced
surface charges on the dielectric give rise to an induced electric ﬁeld Eind in the
direction opposite the external ﬁeld E0 . Therefore, the net electric ﬁeld E in the

␴ind through the relationship E ind ⫽ ␴ind/⑀0 . Because E ⫽ E 0/␬ ⫽ ␴/␬⑀0 , substitution into Equation 26.22 gives

If no dielectric is present, then ␬ ⫽ 1 and ␴ind ⫽ 0 as expected. However, if the dielectric is replaced by an electrical conductor, for which E ⫽ 0, then Equation
26.22 indicates that E 0 ⫽ E ind ; this corresponds to ␴ind ⫽ ␴. That is, the surface
charge induced on the conductor is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to
that on the plates, resulting in a net electric ﬁeld of zero in the conductor.

EXAMPLE 26.9

Solution

We can solve this problem by noting that any
charge that appears on one plate of the capacitor must induce a charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign on the
near side of the slab, as shown in Figure 26.26a. Consequently, the net charge on the slab remains zero, and the
electric ﬁeld inside the slab is zero. Hence, the capacitor is
equivalent to two capacitors in series, each having a plate separation (d ⫺ a)/2, as shown in Figure 26.26b.
Using the rule for adding two capacitors in series (Eq.
26.10), we obtain

Solution In Example 26.9, we found that we could insert a
metallic slab between the plates of a capacitor and consider
the combination as two capacitors in series. The resulting capacitance was independent of the location of the slab. Furthermore, if the thickness of the slab approaches zero, then
the capacitance of the system approaches the capacitance
when the slab is absent. From this, we conclude that we can
insert an inﬁnitesimally thin metallic slab anywhere between
the plates of a capacitor without affecting the capacitance.
Thus, let us imagine sliding an inﬁnitesimally thin metallic
slab along the bottom face of the dielectric shown in Figure
26.27a. We can then consider this system to be the series combination of the two capacitors shown in Figure 26.27b: one
having a plate separation d/3 and ﬁlled with a dielectric, and
the other having a plate separation 2d/3 and air between its
plates.

Summary

SUMMARY
A capacitor consists of two conductors carrying charges of equal magnitude but
opposite sign. The capacitance C of any capacitor is the ratio of the charge Q on
either conductor to the potential difference ⌬V between them:
C⬅

Q
⌬V

(26.1)

This relationship can be used in situations in which any two of the three variables
are known. It is important to remember that this ratio is constant for a given conﬁguration of conductors because the capacitance depends only on the geometry
of the conductors and not on an external source of charge or potential difference.
The SI unit of capacitance is coulombs per volt, or the farad (F), and
1 F ⫽ 1 C/V.
Capacitance expressions for various geometries are summarized in Table 26.2.
If two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, then the potential difference is the same across all of them. The equivalent capacitance of a parallel combination of capacitors is
C eq ⫽ C 1 ⫹ C 2 ⫹ C 3 ⫹ ⭈⭈⭈

(26.8)

If two or more capacitors are connected in series, the charge is the same on all
of them, and the equivalent capacitance of the series combination is given by

These two equations enable you to simplify many electric circuits by replacing multiple capacitors with a single equivalent capacitance.
Work is required to charge a capacitor because the charging process is equivalent to the transfer of charges from one conductor at a lower electric potential to
another conductor at a higher potential. The work done in charging the capacitor
to a charge Q equals the electric potential energy U stored in the capacitor, where

CHAPTER 26

Capacitance and Dielectrics

When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, the capacitance increases by a dimensionless factor ␬, called the dielectric constant:
C ⫽ ␬C 0

(26.14)

where C 0 is the capacitance in the absence of the dielectric. The increase in capacitance is due to a decrease in the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the presence of
the dielectric and to a corresponding decrease in the potential difference between
the plates — if we assume that the charging battery is removed from the circuit before the dielectric is inserted. The decrease in the magnitude of E arises from an
internal electric ﬁeld produced by aligned dipoles in the dielectric. This internal
ﬁeld produced by the dipoles opposes the applied ﬁeld due to the capacitor
plates, and the result is a reduction in the net electric ﬁeld.
The electric dipole moment p of an electric dipole has a magnitude
p ⬅ 2aq

(26.16)

The direction of the electric dipole moment vector is from the negative charge toward the positive charge.
The torque acting on an electric dipole in a uniform electric ﬁeld E is

␶⫽ pⴛ E

(26.18)

The potential energy of an electric dipole in a uniform external electric ﬁeld

Problem-Solving Hints
Capacitors
• Be careful with units. When you calculate capacitance in farads, make sure
that distances are expressed in meters and that you use the SI value of ⑀0 .
When checking consistency of units, remember that the unit for electric
ﬁelds can be either N/C or V/m.
• When two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, the potential difference across each is the same. The charge on each capacitor is proportional
to its capacitance; hence, the capacitances can be added directly to give the
equivalent capacitance of the parallel combination. The equivalent capacitance is always larger than the individual capacitances.
• When two or more capacitors are connected in series, they carry the same
charge, and the sum of the potential differences equals the total potential
difference applied to the combination. The sum of the reciprocals of the capacitances equals the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance, which is always less than the capacitance of the smallest individual capacitor.
• A dielectric increases the capacitance of a capacitor by a factor ␬ (the dielectric constant) over its capacitance when air is between the plates.
• For problems in which a battery is being connected or disconnected, note
whether modiﬁcations to the capacitor are made while it is connected to the
battery or after it has been disconnected. If the capacitor remains connected to the battery, the voltage across the capacitor remains unchanged
(equal to the battery voltage), and the charge is proportional to the capaci-

tance, although it may be modiﬁed (for instance, by the insertion of a dielectric). If you disconnect the capacitor from the battery before making
any modiﬁcations to the capacitor, then its charge remains ﬁxed. In this
case, as you vary the capacitance, the voltage across the plates changes according to the expression ⌬V ⫽ Q /C.

which small size and large capacitance were required,
what factors would be important in your design?
2. The plates of a capacitor are connected to a battery. What

separation. What happens to the external work done in
this process?

11. If the potential difference across a capacitor is doubled,
by what factor does the stored energy change?

turned off? What can be done to make the capacitor safe
to handle after the voltage source has been removed?
13. Describe how you can increase the maximum operating
voltage of a parallel-plate capacitor for a ﬁxed plate separation.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
26.1 (a) because the plate separation is decreased. Capacitance depends only on how a capacitor is constructed
and not on the external circuit.
26.2 Zero. If you construct a spherical gaussian surface outside and concentric with the capacitor, the net charge
inside the surface is zero. Applying Gauss’s law to this
conﬁguration, we ﬁnd that E ⫽ 0 at points outside the
capacitor.
26.3 For a given voltage, the energy stored in a capacitor is
proportional to C : U ⫽ C(⌬V )2/2. Thus, you want to
maximize the equivalent capacitance. You do this by
connecting the three capacitors in parallel, so that the
capacitances add.
26.4 (a) C decreases (Eq. 26.3). (b) Q stays the same because
there is no place for the charge to ﬂow. (c) E remains
constant (see Eq. 24.8 and the paragraph following it).
(d) ⌬V increases because ⌬V ⫽ Q /C, Q is constant
(part b), and C decreases (part a). (e) The energy
stored in the capacitor is proportional to both Q and
⌬V (Eq. 26.11) and thus increases. The additional energy comes from the work you do in pulling the two
plates apart.
26.5 (a) C decreases (Eq. 26.3). (b) Q decreases. The battery
supplies a constant potential difference ⌬V ; thus, charge
must ﬂow out of the capacitor if C ⫽ Q /⌬V is to de-

crease. (c) E decreases because the charge density on
the plates decreases. (d) ⌬V remains constant because
of the presence of the battery. (e) The energy stored in
the capacitor decreases (Eq. 26.11).
26.6 It increases. The dielectric constant of wood (and of all
other insulating materials, for that matter) is greater
than 1; therefore, the capacitance increases (Eq. 26.14).
This increase is sensed by the stud-ﬁnder’s special circuitry, which causes an indicator on the device to light
up.
26.7 (a) C increases (Eq. 26.14). (b) Q increases. Because
the battery maintains a constant ⌬V, Q must increase if
C (⫽Q /⌬V ) increases. (c) E between the plates remains
constant because ⌬V ⫽ Ed and neither ⌬V nor d
changes. The electric ﬁeld due to the charges on the
plates increases because more charge has ﬂowed onto
the plates. The induced surface charges on the dielectric create a ﬁeld that opposes the increase in the ﬁeld
caused by the greater number of charges on the plates.
(d) The battery maintains a constant ⌬V. (e) The energy
stored in the capacitor increases (Eq. 26.11). You would
have to push the dielectric into the capacitor, just as you
would have to do positive work to raise a mass and increase its gravitational potential energy.

hus far our treatment of electrical phenomena has been conﬁned to the study
of charges at rest, or electrostatics. We now consider situations involving electric
charges in motion. We use the term electric current, or simply current, to describe
the rate of ﬂow of charge through some region of space. Most practical applications of electricity deal with electric currents. For example, the battery in a ﬂashlight supplies current to the ﬁlament of the bulb when the switch is turned on. A
variety of home appliances operate on alternating current. In these common situations, the charges ﬂow through a conductor, such as a copper wire. It also is possible for currents to exist outside a conductor. For instance, a beam of electrons in a
television picture tube constitutes a current.
This chapter begins with the deﬁnitions of current and current density. A microscopic description of current is given, and some of the factors that contribute
to the resistance to the ﬂow of charge in conductors are discussed. A classical
model is used to describe electrical conduction in metals, and some of the limitations of this model are cited.

ELECTRIC CURRENT

It is instructive to draw an analogy between water ﬂow and current. In many localities it is common practice to install low-ﬂow showerheads in homes as a waterconservation measure. We quantify the ﬂow of water from these and similar devices by specifying the amount of water that emerges during a given time interval,
which is often measured in liters per minute. On a grander scale, we can characterize a river current by describing the rate at which the water ﬂows past a particular location. For example, the ﬂow over the brink at Niagara Falls is maintained at
rates between 1 400 m3/s and 2 800 m3/s.
Now consider a system of electric charges in motion. Whenever there is a net
flow of charge through some region, a current is said to exist. To deﬁne current
more precisely, suppose that the charges are moving perpendicular to a surface of
area A, as shown in Figure 27.1. (This area could be the cross-sectional area of a wire,
for example.) The current is the rate at which charge ﬂows through this surface. If ⌬Q is the amount of charge that passes through this area in a time interval ⌬t,
the average current I av is equal to the charge that passes through A per unit time:

through an area A. The time rate at
which charge ﬂows through the
area is deﬁned as the current I.
The direction of the current is the
direction in which positive charges
ﬂow when free to do so.

(27.1)

If the rate at which charge ﬂows varies in time, then the current varies in time; we
deﬁne the instantaneous current I as the differential limit of average current:

(27.3)

That is, 1 A of current is equivalent to 1 C of charge passing through the surface
area in 1 s.
The charges passing through the surface in Figure 27.1 can be positive or negative, or both. It is conventional to assign to the current the same direction
as the ﬂow of positive charge. In electrical conductors, such as copper or alu-

The direction of the current

842

CHAPTER 27

Current and Resistance

minum, the current is due to the motion of negatively charged electrons. Therefore, when we speak of current in an ordinary conductor, the direction of the
current is opposite the direction of ﬂow of electrons. However, if we are considering a beam of positively charged protons in an accelerator, the current is in
the direction of motion of the protons. In some cases — such as those involving
gases and electrolytes, for instance — the current is the result of the ﬂow of both
positive and negative charges.
If the ends of a conducting wire are connected to form a loop, all points on
the loop are at the same electric potential, and hence the electric ﬁeld is zero
within and at the surface of the conductor. Because the electric ﬁeld is zero, there
is no net transport of charge through the wire, and therefore there is no current.
The current in the conductor is zero even if the conductor has an excess of charge
on it. However, if the ends of the conducting wire are connected to a battery, all
points on the loop are not at the same potential. The battery sets up a potential
difference between the ends of the loop, creating an electric ﬁeld within the wire.
The electric ﬁeld exerts forces on the conduction electrons in the wire, causing
them to move around the loop and thus creating a current.
It is common to refer to a moving charge (positive or negative) as a mobile
charge carrier. For example, the mobile charge carriers in a metal are electrons.

Average current in a conductor

We can relate current to the motion of the charge carriers by describing a microscopic model of conduction in a metal. Consider the current in a conductor of
cross-sectional area A (Fig. 27.2). The volume of a section of the conductor of
length ⌬x (the gray region shown in Fig. 27.2) is A ⌬x. If n represents the number
of mobile charge carriers per unit volume (in other words, the charge carrier density), the number of carriers in the gray section is nA ⌬x. Therefore, the charge
⌬Q in this section is
⌬Q ⫽ number of carriers in section ⫻ charge per carrier ⫽ (nA ⌬x)q
where q is the charge on each carrier. If the carriers move with a speed vd , the distance they move in a time ⌬t is ⌬x ⫽ vd ⌬t. Therefore, we can write ⌬Q in the
form
⌬Q ⫽ (nAv d ⌬t)q
If we divide both sides of this equation by ⌬t, we see that the average current in
the conductor is

The speed of the charge carriers vd is an average speed called the drift speed.
To understand the meaning of drift speed, consider a conductor in which the
charge carriers are free electrons. If the conductor is isolated — that is, the potential difference across it is zero — then these electrons undergo random motion
that is analogous to the motion of gas molecules. As we discussed earlier, when a
potential difference is applied across the conductor (for example, by means of a
battery), an electric ﬁeld is set up in the conductor; this ﬁeld exerts an electric
force on the electrons, producing a current. However, the electrons do not move
in straight lines along the conductor. Instead, they collide repeatedly with the
metal atoms, and their resultant motion is complicated and zigzag (Fig. 27.3). Despite the collisions, the electrons move slowly along the conductor (in a direction
opposite that of E) at the drift velocity vd .

motion of an electron in a conductor. The changes in direction are the result of collisions between the electron
and atoms in the conductor. Note that the net motion of
the electron is opposite the direction of the electric ﬁeld.
Each section of the zigzag path is a parabolic segment.

We can think of the atom – electron collisions in a conductor as an effective internal friction (or drag force) similar to that experienced by the molecules of a liquid
flowing through a pipe stuffed with steel wool. The energy transferred from the electrons to the metal atoms during collision causes an increase in the vibrational energy
of the atoms and a corresponding increase in the temperature of the conductor.

Drift Speed in a Copper Wire

The 12-gauge copper wire in a typical residential building has
a cross-sectional area of 3.31 ⫻ 10⫺6 m2. If it carries a current
of 10.0 A, what is the drift speed of the electrons? Assume
that each copper atom contributes one free electron to the
current. The density of copper is 8.95 g/cm3.

Solution From the periodic table of the elements in
Appendix C, we ﬁnd that the molar mass of copper is
63.5 g/mol. Recall that 1 mol of any substance contains Avogadro’s number of atoms (6.02 ⫻ 1023). Knowing the density
of copper, we can calculate the volume occupied by 63.5 g

Current and Resistance

Example 27.1 shows that typical drift speeds are very low. For instance, electrons traveling with a speed of 2.46 ⫻ 10⫺4 m/s would take about 68 min to travel
1 m! In view of this, you might wonder why a light turns on almost instantaneously
when a switch is thrown. In a conductor, the electric ﬁeld that drives the free electrons travels through the conductor with a speed close to that of light. Thus, when
you ﬂip on a light switch, the message for the electrons to start moving through
the wire (the electric ﬁeld) reaches them at a speed on the order of 108 m/s.

RESISTANCE AND OHM’S LAW

In Chapter 24 we found that no electric ﬁeld can exist inside a conductor. However, this statement is true only if the conductor is in static equilibrium. The purpose of this section is to describe what happens when the charges in the conductor
are allowed to move.
Charges moving in a conductor produce a current under the action of an electric ﬁeld, which is maintained by the connection of a battery across the conductor.
An electric ﬁeld can exist in the conductor because the charges in this situation
are in motion — that is, this is a nonelectrostatic situation.
Consider a conductor of cross-sectional area A carrying a current I. The current density J in the conductor is deﬁned as the current per unit area. Because
the current I ⫽ nqv d A, the current density is
J⬅

I
⫽ nqv d
A

(27.5)

where J has SI units of A/m2. This expression is valid only if the current density is
uniform and only if the surface of cross-sectional area A is perpendicular to the direction of the current. In general, the current density is a vector quantity:
J ⫽ nqvd

Current density

(27.6)

From this equation, we see that current density, like current, is in the direction of
charge motion for positive charge carriers and opposite the direction of motion
for negative charge carriers.
A current density J and an electric ﬁeld E are established in a conductor
whenever a potential difference is maintained across the conductor. If the
potential difference is constant, then the current also is constant. In some materials, the current density is proportional to the electric ﬁeld:
J ⫽ ␴E

Ohm’s law

(27.7)

where the constant of proportionality ␴ is called the conductivity of the conductor.1 Materials that obey Equation 27.7 are said to follow Ohm’s law, named after Georg Simon Ohm (1787 – 1854). More speciﬁcally, Ohm’s law states that
for many materials (including most metals), the ratio of the current density to
the electric ﬁeld is a constant ␴ that is independent of the electric ﬁeld producing the current.
Materials that obey Ohm’s law and hence demonstrate this simple relationship between E and J are said to be ohmic. Experimentally, it is found that not all materials
have this property, however, and materials that do not obey Ohm’s law are said to

relationship valid only for certain materials.

Quick Quiz 27.2
Suppose that a current-carrying ohmic metal wire has a cross-sectional area that gradually
becomes smaller from one end of the wire to the other. How do drift velocity, current density, and electric ﬁeld vary along the wire? Note that the current must have the same value
everywhere in the wire so that charge does not accumulate at any one point.

We can obtain a form of Ohm’s law useful in practical applications by considering a segment of straight wire of uniform cross-sectional area A and length ᐉ , as
shown in Figure 27.5. A potential difference ⌬V ⫽ V b ⫺ V a is maintained across
the wire, creating in the wire an electric ﬁeld and a current. If the ﬁeld is assumed
to be uniform, the potential difference is related to the ﬁeld through the relationship2

Therefore, we can express the magnitude of the current density in the wire as

Current and Resistance

An assortment of resistors used in electric circuits.

This expression shows that if a potential difference of 1 V across a conductor
causes a current of 1 A, the resistance of the conductor is 1 ⍀. For example, if an
electrical appliance connected to a 120-V source of potential difference carries a
current of 6 A, its resistance is 20 ⍀.
Equation 27.8 solved for potential difference (⌬V ⫽ Iᐉ/␴A ) explains part of the
chapter-opening puzzler: How can a bird perch on a high-voltage power line without
being electrocuted? Even though the potential difference between the ground and
the wire might be hundreds of thousands of volts, that between the bird’s feet (which
is what determines how much current ﬂows through the bird) is very small.

Every ohmic material has a characteristic resistivity that depends on the properties
of the material and on temperature. Additionally, as you can see from Equation
27.11, the resistance of a sample depends on geometry as well as on resistivity.
Table 27.1 gives the resistivities of a variety of materials at 20°C. Note the enormous range, from very low values for good conductors such as copper and silver,
to very high values for good insulators such as glass and rubber. An ideal conductor would have zero resistivity, and an ideal insulator would have inﬁnite resistivity.
Equation 27.11 shows that the resistance of a given cylindrical conductor is
proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. If
the length of a wire is doubled, then its resistance doubles. If its cross-sectional
area is doubled, then its resistance decreases by one half. The situation is analogous to the ﬂow of a liquid through a pipe. As the pipe’s length is increased, the

resistance to ﬂow increases. As the pipe’s cross-sectional area is increased, more
liquid crosses a given cross-section of the pipe per unit time. Thus, more liquid
ﬂows for the same pressure differential applied to the pipe, and the resistance to
ﬂow decreases.
Most electric circuits use devices called resistors to control the current level
in the various parts of the circuit. Two common types of resistors are the composition resistor, which contains carbon, and the wire-wound resistor, which consists of a
coil of wire. Resistors’ values in ohms are normally indicated by color-coding, as
shown in Figure 27.6 and Table 27.2.
Ohmic materials have a linear current – potential difference relationship over
a broad range of applied potential differences (Fig. 27.7a). The slope of the
I-versus-⌬V curve in the linear region yields a value for 1/R. Nonohmic materials

The Radial Resistance of a Coaxial Cable

Coaxial cables are used extensively for cable television and
other electronic applications. A coaxial cable consists of two
cylindrical conductors. The gap between the conductors is

completely ﬁlled with silicon, as shown in Figure 27.8a, and
current leakage through the silicon is unwanted. (The cable
is designed to conduct current along its length.) The radius

outer one is b ⫽ 1.75 cm, and the length of the cable is

the two conductors.

Solution In this type of problem, we must divide the object whose resistance we are calculating into concentric elements of inﬁnitesimal thickness dr (Fig. 27.8b). We start by
using the differential form of Equation 27.11, replacing ᐉ
with r for the distance variable: dR ⫽ ␳ dr/A, where dR is the
resistance of an element of silicon of thickness dr and surface
area A. In this example, we take as our representative concentric element a hollow silicon cylinder of radius r, thickness dr,
and length L, as shown in Figure 27.8. Any current that
passes from the inner conductor to the outer one must pass
radially through this concentric element, and the area
through which this current passes is A ⫽ 2␲rL . (This is the
curved surface area — circumference multiplied by length —
of our hollow silicon cylinder of thickness dr.) Hence, we can

A MODEL FOR ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION

In this section we describe a classical model of electrical conduction in metals that
was ﬁrst proposed by Paul Drude in 1900. This model leads to Ohm’s law and
shows that resistivity can be related to the motion of electrons in metals. Although
the Drude model described here does have limitations, it nevertheless introduces
concepts that are still applied in more elaborate treatments.
Consider a conductor as a regular array of atoms plus a collection of free electrons, which are sometimes called conduction electrons. The conduction electrons,
although bound to their respective atoms when the atoms are not part of a solid,
gain mobility when the free atoms condense into a solid. In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, the conduction electrons move in random directions through the con-

851

27.3 A Model for Electrical Conduction

ductor with average speeds of the order of 106 m/s. The situation is similar to the
motion of gas molecules conﬁned in a vessel. In fact, some scientists refer to conduction electrons in a metal as an electron gas. There is no current through the conductor in the absence of an electric ﬁeld because the drift velocity of the free electrons is zero. That is, on the average, just as many electrons move in one direction
as in the opposite direction, and so there is no net ﬂow of charge.
This situation changes when an electric ﬁeld is applied. Now, in addition to
undergoing the random motion just described, the free electrons drift slowly in a
direction opposite that of the electric ﬁeld, with an average drift speed vd that is
much smaller (typically 10⫺4 m/s) than their average speed between collisions
(typically 106 m/s).
Figure 27.9 provides a crude description of the motion of free electrons in a
conductor. In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, there is no net displacement after
many collisions (Fig. 27.9a). An electric ﬁeld E modiﬁes the random motion and
causes the electrons to drift in a direction opposite that of E (Fig. 27.9b). The
slight curvature in the paths shown in Figure 27.9b results from the acceleration of
the electrons between collisions, which is caused by the applied ﬁeld.
In our model, we assume that the motion of an electron after a collision is independent of its motion before the collision. We also assume that the excess energy acquired by the electrons in the electric ﬁeld is lost to the atoms of the conductor when the electrons and atoms collide. The energy given up to the atoms
increases their vibrational energy, and this causes the temperature of the conductor to increase. The temperature increase of a conductor due to resistance is utilized in electric toasters and other familiar appliances.
We are now in a position to derive an expression for the drift velocity. When a
free electron of mass me and charge q (⫽⫺e) is subjected to an electric ﬁeld E, it
experiences a force F ⫽ qE. Because ⌺F ⫽ me a, we conclude that the acceleration
of the electron is
qE

(27.13)

We now take the average value of vf over all possible times t and all possible values
of vi . If we assume that the initial velocities are randomly distributed over all possible values, we see that the average value of vi is zero. The term (qE/m e )t is the velocity added by the ﬁeld during one trip between atoms. If the electron starts with
zero velocity, then the average value of the second term of Equation 27.13 is
(qE/m e )␶, where ␶ is the average time interval between successive collisions. Because the
average value of vf is equal to the drift velocity,4 we have

This acceleration, which occurs for only a short time between collisions, enables
the electron to acquire a small drift velocity. If t is the time since the last collision
and vi is the electron’s initial velocity the instant after that collision, then the velocity of the electron after a time t is

4 Because the collision process is random, each collision event is independent of what happened earlier.
This is analogous to the random process of throwing a die. The probability of rolling a particular number on one throw is independent of the result of the previous throw. On average, the particular number comes up every sixth throw, starting at any arbitrary time.

We can relate this expression for drift velocity to the current in the conductor.
Substituting Equation 27.14 into Equation 27.6, we ﬁnd that the magnitude of the

According to this classical model, conductivity and resistivity do not depend on the

Ohm’s law.
The average time between collisions ␶ is related to the average distance between collisions ᐉ (that is, the mean free path; see Section 21.7) and the average

which is equivalent to 40 nm (compared with atomic spacings
of about 0.2 nm). Thus, although the time between collisions
is very short, an electron in the wire travels about 200 atomic
spacings between collisions.

Although this classical model of conduction is consistent with Ohm’s law, it is
not satisfactory for explaining some important phenomena. For example, classical
values for v calculated on the basis of an ideal-gas model (see Section 21.6) are
smaller than the true values by about a factor of ten. Furthermore, if we substitute
ᐉ / v for ␶ in Equation 27.17 and rearrange terms so that v appears in the numerator, we ﬁnd that the resistivity ␳ is proportional to v . According to the ideal-gas
model, v is proportional to !T ; hence, it should also be true that ␳ ⬀ !T . This is in
disagreement with the fact that, for pure metals, resistivity depends linearly on
temperature. We are able to account for the linear dependence only by using a
quantum mechanical model, which we now describe brieﬂy.

853

27.4 Resistance and Temperature

According to quantum mechanics, electrons have wave-like properties. If the
array of atoms in a conductor is regularly spaced (that is, it is periodic), then the
wave-like character of the electrons enables them to move freely through the conductor, and a collision with an atom is unlikely. For an idealized conductor, no collisions would occur, the mean free path would be inﬁnite, and the resistivity would
be zero. Electron waves are scattered only if the atomic arrangement is irregular
(not periodic) as a result of, for example, structural defects or impurities. At low
temperatures, the resistivity of metals is dominated by scattering caused by collisions between electrons and defects or impurities. At high temperatures, the resistivity is dominated by scattering caused by collisions between electrons and atoms
of the conductor, which are continuously displaced from the regularly spaced array as a result of thermal agitation. The thermal motion of the atoms causes the
structure to be irregular (compared with an atomic array at rest), thereby reducing the electron’s mean free path.

27.4

RESISTANCE AND TEMPERATURE

Over a limited temperature range, the resistivity of a metal varies approximately
linearly with temperature according to the expression

␳ ⫽ ␳ 0[1 ⫹ ␣(T ⫺ T0 )]

(27.19)

Variation of ␳ with temperature

where ␳ is the resistivity at some temperature T (in degrees Celsius), ␳0 is the resistivity at some reference temperature T0 (usually taken to be 20°C), and ␣ is the
temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity. From Equation 27.19, we see that the temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity can be expressed as

␣⫽

1 ⌬␳
␳ 0 ⌬T

(27.20)

Temperature coefﬁcient of
resistivity

where ⌬␳ ⫽ ␳ ⫺ ␳ 0 is the change in resistivity in the temperature interval
⌬T ⫽ T ⫺ T0 .
The temperature coefﬁcients of resistivity for various materials are given in
Table 27.1. Note that the unit for ␣ is degrees Celsius⫺1 [(°C)⫺1]. Because resistance is proportional to resistivity (Eq. 27.11), we can write the variation of resistance as
R ⫽ R 0[1 ⫹ ␣(T ⫺ T0 )]
(27.21)
Use of this property enables us to make precise temperature measurements, as
shown in the following example.

EXAMPLE 27.6

A Platinum Resistance Thermometer

A resistance thermometer, which measures temperature by
measuring the change in resistance of a conductor, is made
from platinum and has a resistance of 50.0 ⍀ at 20.0°C.
When immersed in a vessel containing melting indium, its resistance increases to 76.8 ⍀. Calculate the melting point of
the indium.

Solution

Solving Equation 27.21 for ⌬T and using the ␣

value for platinum given in Table 27.1, we obtain

Resistivity versus temperature for a pure
semiconductor, such as silicon or germanium.

For metals like copper, resistivity is nearly proportional to temperature, as
shown in Figure 27.10. However, a nonlinear region always exists at very low temperatures, and the resistivity usually approaches some ﬁnite value as the temperature nears absolute zero. This residual resistivity near absolute zero is caused primarily by the collision of electrons with impurities and imperfections in the metal.
In contrast, high-temperature resistivity (the linear region) is predominantly characterized by collisions between electrons and metal atoms.
Notice that three of the ␣ values in Table 27.1 are negative; this indicates that
the resistivity of these materials decreases with increasing temperature (Fig.
27.11). This behavior is due to an increase in the density of charge carriers at
higher temperatures.
Because the charge carriers in a semiconductor are often associated with impurity atoms, the resistivity of these materials is very sensitive to the type and concentration of such impurities. We shall return to the study of semiconductors in
Chapter 43 of the extended version of this text.

SUPERCONDUCTORS

There is a class of metals and compounds whose resistance decreases to zero when
they are below a certain temperature Tc , known as the critical temperature. These
materials are known as superconductors. The resistance – temperature graph for
a superconductor follows that of a normal metal at temperatures above Tc (Fig.
27.12). When the temperature is at or below Tc , the resistivity drops suddenly to
zero. This phenomenon was discovered in 1911 by the Dutch physicist Heike
Kamerlingh-Onnes (1853 – 1926) as he worked with mercury, which is a superconductor below 4.2 K. Recent measurements have shown that the resistivities of superconductors below their Tc values are less than 4 ⫻ 10 ⫺25 ⍀⭈ m — around 1017
times smaller than the resistivity of copper and in practice considered to be zero.
Today thousands of superconductors are known, and as Figure 27.13 illustrates, the critical temperatures of recently discovered superconductors are substantially higher than initially thought possible. Two kinds of superconductors are
recognized. The more recently identiﬁed ones, such as Y Ba2Cu3O7 , are essentially
ceramics with high critical temperatures, whereas superconducting materials such

CHAPTER 27

Current and Resistance

One of the truly remarkable features of superconductors is that once a current
is set up in them, it persists without any applied potential difference (because R ⫽ 0).
Steady currents have been observed to persist in superconducting loops for several
years with no apparent decay!
An important and useful application of superconductivity is in the development of superconducting magnets, in which the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬁeld
are about ten times greater than those produced by the best normal electromagnets. Such superconducting magnets are being considered as a means of storing energy. Superconducting magnets are currently used in medical magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) units, which produce high-quality images of internal organs without
the need for excessive exposure of patients to x-rays or other harmful radiation.
For further information on superconductivity, see Section 43.8.

Power

ELECTRICAL ENERGY AND POWER

If a battery is used to establish an electric current in a conductor, the chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed into kinetic energy of the
charge carriers. In the conductor, this kinetic energy is quickly lost as a result of
collisions between the charge carriers and the atoms making up the conductor,
and this leads to an increase in the temperature of the conductor. In other words,
the chemical energy stored in the battery is continuously transformed to internal
energy associated with the temperature of the conductor.
Consider a simple circuit consisting of a battery whose terminals are connected to a resistor, as shown in Figure 27.14. (Resistors are designated by the symbol
.) Now imagine following a positive quantity of charge ⌬Q that is
moving clockwise around the circuit from point a through the battery and resistor
back to point a. Points a and d are grounded (ground is designated by the symbol
); that is, we take the electric potential at these two points to be zero. As the
charge moves from a to b through the battery, its electric potential energy U
increases by an amount ⌬V ⌬Q (where ⌬V is the potential difference between b and
a), while the chemical potential energy in the battery decreases by the same
amount. (Recall from Eq. 25.9 that ⌬U ⫽ q ⌬V.) However, as the charge moves
from c to d through the resistor, it loses this electric potential energy as it collides
with atoms in the resistor, thereby producing internal energy. If we neglect the resistance of the connecting wires, no loss in energy occurs for paths bc and da.
When the charge arrives at point a, it must have the same electric potential energy
(zero) that it had at the start.5 Note that because charge cannot build up at any
point, the current is the same everywhere in the circuit.
The rate at which the charge ⌬Q loses potential energy in going through the
resistor is
⌬U
⌬Q
⫽
⌬V ⫽ I ⌬V
⌬t
⌬t
where I is the current in the circuit. In contrast, the charge regains this energy
when it passes through the battery. Because the rate at which the charge loses energy equals the power ᏼ delivered to the resistor (which appears as internal energy), we have
ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V
(27.22)
5

Note that once the current reaches its steady-state value, there is no change in the kinetic energy of
the charge carriers creating the current.

857

27.6 Electrical Energy and Power

In this case, the power is supplied to a resistor by a battery. However, we can use
Equation 27.22 to determine the power transferred to any device carrying a current I and having a potential difference ⌬V between its terminals.
Using Equation 27.22 and the fact that ⌬V ⫽ IR for a resistor, we can express
the power delivered to the resistor in the alternative forms
ᏼ ⫽ I 2R ⫽

(⌬V )2
R

(27.23)

When I is expressed in amperes, ⌬V in volts, and R in ohms, the SI unit of power
is the watt, as it was in Chapter 7 in our discussion of mechanical power. The
power lost as internal energy in a conductor of resistance R is called joule heating 6;
this transformation is also often referred to as an I 2R loss.
A battery, a device that supplies electrical energy, is called either a source of electromotive force or, more commonly, an emf source. The concept of emf is discussed in
greater detail in Chapter 28. (The phrase electromotive force is an unfortunate
choice because it describes not a force but rather a potential difference in volts.)
When the internal resistance of the battery is neglected, the potential difference between points a and b in Figure 27.14 is equal to the emf of the battery — that is, ⌬V ⫽ V b ⫺ V a ⫽ . This being true, we can state that the current in
the circuit is I ⫽ ⌬V/R ⫽ /R. Because ⌬V ⫽ , the power supplied by the emf
source can be expressed as ᏼ ⫽ I , which equals the power delivered to the resistor, I 2R.
When transporting electrical energy through power lines, such as those shown
in Figure 27.15, utility companies seek to minimize the power transformed to internal energy in the lines and maximize the energy delivered to the consumer. Because ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V, the same amount of power can be transported either at high currents and low potential differences or at low currents and high potential
differences. Utility companies choose to transport electrical energy at low currents
and high potential differences primarily for economic reasons. Copper wire is very
expensive, and so it is cheaper to use high-resistance wire (that is, wire having a
small cross-sectional area; see Eq. 27.11). Thus, in the expression for the power delivered to a resistor, ᏼ ⫽ I 2R , the resistance of the wire is ﬁxed at a relatively high
value for economic considerations. The I 2R loss can be reduced by keeping the
current I as low as possible. In some instances, power is transported at potential
differences as great as 765 kV. Once the electricity reaches your city, the potential
difference is usually reduced to 4 kV by a device called a transformer. Another transformer drops the potential difference to 240 V before the electricity ﬁnally reaches
your home. Of course, each time the potential difference decreases, the current
increases by the same factor, and the power remains the same. We shall discuss
transformers in greater detail in Chapter 33.

emerge not in a steady stream but rather in pulses at the rate
of 250 pulses/s. This corresponds to a time between pulses of

the electrons in the pulse constitute a current of 250 mA.
The current is zero between pulses. (a) How many electrons
are delivered by the accelerator per pulse?

Q

Demands on our dwindling energy supplies have made it necessary for us to be aware of the energy requirements of our
electrical devices. Every electrical appliance carries a label
that contains the information you need to calculate the appliance’s power requirements. In many cases, the power consumption in watts is stated directly, as it is on a lightbulb. In
other cases, the amount of current used by the device and
the potential difference at which it operates are given. This
information and Equation 27.22 are sufﬁcient for calculating
the operating cost of any electrical device.

(c) What is the maximum power delivered by the electron
beam?

Solution By deﬁnition, power is energy delivered per unit
time. Thus, the maximum power is equal to the energy delivered by a pulse divided by the pulse duration:
ᏼ⫽
⫽

E
⌬t
(3.13 ⫻ 10 11 electrons/pulse)(40.0 MeV/electron)

⫽ 1.00 ⫻ 10 7 W ⫽ 10.0 MW
We could also compute this power directly. We assume that
each electron had zero energy before being accelerated.
Thus, by deﬁnition, each electron must have gone through a
potential difference of 40.0 MV to acquire a ﬁnal energy of
40.0 MeV. Hence, we have

SUMMARY
The electric current I in a conductor is deﬁned as
I⬅

dQ
dt

(27.2)

where dQ is the charge that passes through a cross-section of the conductor in a
time dt. The SI unit of current is the ampere (A), where 1 A ⫽ 1 C/s.
The average current in a conductor is related to the motion of the charge carriers through the relationship
I av ⫽ nqv d A

(27.4)

where n is the density of charge carriers, q is the charge on each carrier, vd is the
drift speed, and A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.
The magnitude of the current density J in a conductor is the current per
unit area:
J⬅

I
⫽ nqv d
A

(27.5)

The current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric ﬁeld according to the expression
J ⫽ ␴E

(27.7)

The proportionality constant ␴ is called the conductivity of the material of which
the conductor is made. The inverse of ␴ is known as resistivity ␳ (␳ ⫽ 1/␴). Equation 27.7 is known as Ohm’s law, and a material is said to obey this law if the ratio
of its current density J to its applied electric ﬁeld E is a constant that is independent of the applied ﬁeld.
The resistance R of a conductor is deﬁned either in terms of the length of
the conductor or in terms of the potential difference across it:
R⬅

⌬V
ᐉ
⬅
␴A
I

(27.8)

where ᐉ is the length of the conductor, ␴ is the conductivity of the material of
which it is made, A is its cross-sectional area, ⌬V is the potential difference across
it, and I is the current it carries.

The SI unit of resistance is volts per ampere, which is deﬁned to be 1 ohm
(⍀); that is, 1 ⍀ ⫽ 1 V/A. If the resistance is independent of the applied potential
difference, the conductor obeys Ohm’s law.
In a classical model of electrical conduction in metals, the electrons are
treated as molecules of a gas. In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, the average velocity of the electrons is zero. When an electric ﬁeld is applied, the electrons move
(on the average) with a drift velocity vd that is opposite the electric ﬁeld and
given by the expression
qE
(27.14)
vd ⫽
␶
me
where ␶ is the average time between electron – atom collisions, me is the mass of the
electron, and q is its charge. According to this model, the resistivity of the metal is

␳⫽

me
nq 2␶

(27.17)

where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume.
The resistivity of a conductor varies approximately linearly with temperature
according to the expression

␳ ⫽ ␳ 0[1 ⫹ ␣(T ⫺ T0 )]

(27.19)

where ␣ is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity and ␳0 is the resistivity at
some reference temperature T0 .
If a potential difference ⌬V is maintained across a resistor, the power, or rate
at which energy is supplied to the resistor, is
ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V

(27.22)

Because the potential difference across a resistor is given by ⌬V ⫽ IR, we can express the power delivered to a resistor in the form
ᏼ ⫽ I 2R ⫽

(⌬V )2
R

(27.23)

The electrical energy supplied to a resistor appears in the form of internal energy
in the resistor.

68. A close analogy exists between the ﬂow of energy due to
a temperature difference (see Section 20.7) and the
ﬂow of electric charge due to a potential difference.
The energy dQ and the electric charge dq are both
transported by free electrons in the conducting material. Consequently, a good electrical conductor is usually
a good thermal conductor as well. Consider a thin conducting slab of thickness dx, area A, and electrical conductivity ␴, with a potential difference dV between opposite faces. Show that the current I ⫽ dq/dt is given by

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
27.1 d, b ⫽ c, a. The current in part (d) is equivalent to two
positive charges moving to the left. Parts (b) and (c)
each represent four positive charges moving in the same
direction because negative charges moving to the left
are equivalent to positive charges moving to the right.
The current in part (a) is equivalent to ﬁve positive
charges moving to the right.
27.2 Every portion of the wire carries the same current even
though the wire constricts. As the cross-sectional area
decreases, the drift velocity must increase in order for
the constant current to be maintained, in accordance
with Equation 27.4. Equations 27.5 and 27.6 indicate
that the current density also increases. An increasing
electric ﬁeld must be causing the increasing current
density, as indicated by Equation 27.7. If you were to
draw this situation, you would show the electric ﬁeld
lines being compressed into the smaller area, indicating
increasing magnitude of the electric ﬁeld.
27.3 The curvature of the line indicates that the device is
nonohmic (that is, its resistance varies with potential difference). Being the deﬁnition of resistance, Equation
27.8 still applies, giving different values for R at different points on the curve. The slope of the tangent to the
graph line at a point is the reciprocal of the “dynamic
resistance” at that point. Note that the resistance of the
device (as measured by an ohmmeter) is the reciprocal
of the slope of a secant line joining the origin to a particular point on the curve.
27.4 The cable should be as short as possible but still able to
reach from one vehicle to another (small ᐉ), it should
be quite thick (large A), and it should be made of a ma-

terial with a low resistivity ␳. Referring to Table 27.1, you
should probably choose copper or aluminum because
the only two materials in the table that have lower ␳ values — silver and gold — are prohibitively expensive for
your purposes.
27.5 Just after it is turned on. When the ﬁlament is at room
temperature, its resistance is low, and hence the current
is relatively large (I ⫽ ⌬V/R ). As the ﬁlament warms up,
its resistance increases, and the current decreases. Older
lightbulbs often fail just as they are turned on because
this large initial current “spike” produces rapid temperature increase and stress on the ﬁlament.
27.6 (c). Because the potential difference ⌬V is the same
across the two bulbs and because the power delivered to
a conductor is ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V, the 60-W bulb, with its higher
power rating, must carry the greater current. The 30-W
bulb has the higher resistance because it draws less current at the same potential difference.
27.7 I a ⫽ I b ⬎ I c ⫽ I d ⬎ I e ⫽ I f . The current Ia leaves the
positive terminal of the battery and then splits to ﬂow
through the two bulbs; thus, I a ⫽ I c ⫹ I e . From Quick
Quiz 27.6, we know that the current in the 60-W bulb is
greater than that in the 30-W bulb. (Note that all the
current does not follow the “path of least resistance,”
which in this case is through the 60-W bulb.) Because
charge does not build up in the bulbs, we know that all
the charge ﬂowing into a bulb from the left must ﬂow
out on the right; consequently, Ic ⫽ Id and I e ⫽ I f . The
two currents leaving the bulbs recombine to form the
current back into the battery, I f ⫹ I d ⫽ I b .

his chapter is concerned with the analysis of some simple electric circuits that
contain batteries, resistors, and capacitors in various combinations. The analysis
of these circuits is simpliﬁed by the use of two rules known as Kirchhoff’s rules,
which follow from the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of electric
charge. Most of the circuits analyzed are assumed to be in steady state, which means
that the currents are constant in magnitude and direction. In Section 28.4 we discuss circuits in which the current varies with time. Finally, we describe a variety of
common electrical devices and techniques for measuring current, potential difference, resistance, and emf.

28.1

ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE

In Section 27.6 we found that a constant current can be maintained in a closed circuit through the use of a source of emf, which is a device (such as a battery or generator) that produces an electric ﬁeld and thus may cause charges to move around
a circuit. One can think of a source of emf as a “charge pump.” When an electric
potential difference exists between two points, the source moves charges “uphill”
from the lower potential to the higher. The emf
describes the work done per
unit charge, and hence the SI unit of emf is the volt.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 28.1, consisting of a battery connected to
a resistor. We assume that the connecting wires have no resistance. The positive
terminal of the battery is at a higher potential than the negative terminal. If we neglect the internal resistance of the battery, the potential difference across it (called
the terminal voltage) equals its emf. However, because a real battery always has some
internal resistance r, the terminal voltage is not equal to the emf for a battery in a
circuit in which there is a current. To understand why this is so, consider the circuit diagram in Figure 28.2a, where the battery of Figure 28.1 is represented by
the dashed rectangle containing an emf
in series with an internal resistance r.
Now imagine moving through the battery clockwise from a to b and measuring the
electric potential at various locations. As we pass from the negative terminal to the
positive terminal, the potential increases by an amount . However, as we move
through the resistance r, the potential decreases by an amount Ir, where I is the current in the circuit. Thus, the terminal voltage of the battery ⌬V ⫽ V b ⫺ V a is1

The terminal voltage in this case is less than the emf by an amount Ir. In some situations, the terminal
voltage may exceed the emf by an amount Ir. This happens when the direction of the current is opposite
that of the emf, as in the case of charging a battery with another source of emf.

From this expression, note that is equivalent to the open-circuit voltage — that
is, the terminal voltage when the current is zero. The emf is the voltage labeled on a
battery — for example, the emf of a D cell is 1.5 V. The actual potential difference
between the terminals of the battery depends on the current through the battery,
as described by Equation 28.1.
Figure 28.2b is a graphical representation of the changes in electric potential
as the circuit is traversed in the clockwise direction. By inspecting Figure 28.2a, we
see that the terminal voltage ⌬V must equal the potential difference across the external resistance R, often called the load resistance. The load resistor might be a
simple resistive circuit element, as in Figure 28.1, or it could be the resistance of
some electrical device (such as a toaster, an electric heater, or a lightbulb) connected to the battery (or, in the case of household devices, to the wall outlet). The
resistor represents a load on the battery because the battery must supply energy to
operate the device. The potential difference across the load resistance is ⌬V ⫽ IR .

This equation shows that the current in this simple circuit depends on both the
load resistance R external to the battery and the internal resistance r. If R is much
greater than r, as it is in many real-world circuits, we can neglect r.
If we multiply Equation 28.2 by the current I, we obtain

This equation indicates that, because power ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V (see Eq. 27.22), the total
power output I of the battery is delivered to the external load resistance in the
amount I 2R and to the internal resistance in the amount I 2r. Again, if r V R , then
most of the power delivered by the battery is transferred to the load resistance.

RESISTORS IN SERIES AND IN PARALLEL

Suppose that you and your friends are at a crowded basketball game in a sports
arena and decide to leave early. You have two choices: (1) your whole group can
exit through a single door and walk down a long hallway containing several concession stands, each surrounded by a large crowd of people waiting to buy food or
souvenirs; or (b) each member of your group can exit through a separate door in
the main hall of the arena, where each will have to push his or her way through a
single group of people standing by the door. In which scenario will less time be required for your group to leave the arena?
It should be clear that your group will be able to leave faster through the separate
doors than down the hallway where each of you has to push through several groups of
people. We could describe the groups of people in the hallway as acting in series, because each of you must push your way through all of the groups. The groups of people around the doors in the arena can be described as acting in parallel. Each member
of your group must push through only one group of people, and each member
pushes through a different group of people. This simple analogy will help us understand the behavior of currents in electric circuits containing more than one resistor.
When two or more resistors are connected together as are the lightbulbs in
Figure 28.4a, they are said to be in series. Figure 28.4b is the circuit diagram for the
lightbulbs, which are shown as resistors, and the battery. In a series connection, all
the charges moving through one resistor must also pass through the second resistor. (This is analogous to all members of your group pushing through the crowds
in the single hallway of the sports arena.) Otherwise, charge would accumulate between the resistors. Thus,
for a series combination of resistors, the currents in the two resistors are the
same because any charge that passes through R 1 must also pass through R 2 .
The potential difference applied across the series combination of resistors will divide between the resistors. In Figure 28.4b, because the voltage drop2 from a to b

often by individuals working with electric circuits.

Therefore, we can replace the two resistors in series with a single resistor having an

(28.5)

The resistance R eq is equivalent to the series combination R 1 ⫹ R 2 in the sense
that the circuit current is unchanged when R eq replaces R 1 ⫹ R 2 .
The equivalent resistance of three or more resistors connected in series is
R eq ⫽ R 1 ⫹ R 2 ⫹ R 3 ⫹ ⭈⭈⭈

(28.6)

This relationship indicates that the equivalent resistance of a series connection of resistors is always greater than any individual resistance.

would their relative intensities differ if they were connected in parallel?

Now consider two resistors connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 28.5.
When the current I reaches point a in Figure 28.5b, called a junction, it splits into
two parts, with I 1 going through R 1 and I 2 going through R 2 . A junction is any
point in a circuit where a current can split ( just as your group might split up and
leave the arena through several doors, as described earlier.) This split results in
less current in each individual resistor than the current leaving the battery. Because charge must be conserved, the current I that enters point a must equal the
total current leaving that point:

We can see from this expression that the equivalent resistance of two or more
resistors connected in parallel is always less than the least resistance in the
group.
Household circuits are always wired such that the appliances are connected in
parallel. Each device operates independently of the others so that if one is
switched off, the others remain on. In addition, the devices operate on the same
voltage.

Find the Equivalent Resistance

Four resistors are connected as shown in Figure 28.6a.
(a) Find the equivalent resistance between points a and c.

Solution The combination of resistors can be reduced in
steps, as shown in Figure 28.6. The 8.0-⍀ and 4.0-⍀ resistors
are in series; thus, the equivalent resistance between a and b
is 12 ⍀ (see Eq. 28.5). The 6.0-⍀ and 3.0-⍀ resistors are in
parallel, so from Equation 28.7 we ﬁnd that the equivalent resistance from b to c is 2.0 ⍀. Hence, the equivalent resistance

I 2 ⫽ 2.0 A. We could have guessed this at the start by noting
that the current through the 3.0-⍀ resistor has to be twice that
through the 6.0-⍀ resistor, in view of their relative resistances
and the fact that the same voltage is applied to each of them.
As a ﬁnal check of our results, note that ⌬V bc ⫽ (6.0 ⍀)I 1 ⫽
(3.0 ⍀)I 2 ⫽ 6.0 V and ⌬V ab ⫽ (12 ⍀)I ⫽ 36 V; therefore,
⌬V ac ⫽ ⌬V ab ⫹ ⌬V bc ⫽ 42 V, as it must.

from a to c is 14 ⍀.
(b) What is the current in each resistor if a potential difference of 42 V is maintained between a and c ?

8.0 Ω
(a)

This is the current in the 8.0-⍀ and 4.0-⍀ resistors. When this
3.0-A current enters the junction at b , however, it splits, with
part passing through the 6.0-⍀ resistor (I 1 ) and part through
the 3.0-⍀ resistor (I 2 ). Because the potential difference is ⌬Vbc
across each of these resistors (since they are in parallel), we see
that (6.0 ⍀)I 1 ⫽ (3.0 ⍀)I 2 , or I 2 ⫽ 2I 1 . Using this result and
the fact that I 1 ⫹ I 2 ⫽ 3.0 A, we ﬁnd that I 1 ⫽ 1.0 A and

resistor subject to the 42-V potential difference. Therefore,

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 28.6

Operation of a Three-Way Lightbulb

Figure 28.9 illustrates how a three-way lightbulb is constructed to provide three levels of light intensity. The socket
of the lamp is equipped with a three-way switch for selecting
different light intensities. The bulb contains two ﬁlaments.
When the lamp is connected to a 120-V source, one ﬁlament
receives 100 W of power, and the other receives 75 W. Explain how the two ﬁlaments are used to provide three different light intensities.

Solution The three light intensities are made possible by
applying the 120 V to one ﬁlament alone, to the other ﬁlament alone, or to the two ﬁlaments in parallel. When switch
S1 is closed and switch S2 is opened, current passes only
through the 75-W ﬁlament. When switch S1 is open and
switch S2 is closed, current passes only through the 100-W ﬁlament. When both switches are closed, current passes
through both ﬁlaments, and the total power is 175 W.
If the ﬁlaments were connected in series and one of them
were to break, no current could pass through the bulb, and
the bulb would give no illumination, regardless of the switch
position. However, with the ﬁlaments connected in parallel, if
one of them (for example, the 75-W ﬁlament) breaks, the
bulb will still operate in two of the switch positions as current
passes through the other (100-W) ﬁlament.

be removed from the circuit and the remaining circuit then

Strings of Lights

Strings of lights are used for many ornamental purposes,
such as decorating Christmas trees. Over the years, both parallel and series connections have been used for multilight
strings powered by 120 V.3 Series-wired bulbs are safer than
parallel-wired bulbs for indoor Christmas-tree use because
series-wired bulbs operate with less light per bulb and at a
lower temperature. However, if the ﬁlament of a single bulb
fails (or if the bulb is removed from its socket), all the lights
on the string are extinguished. The popularity of series-wired
light strings diminished because troubleshooting a failed
bulb was a tedious, time-consuming chore that involved trialand-error substitution of a good bulb in each socket along
the string until the defective bulb was found.
3

In a parallel-wired string, each bulb operates at 120 V. By
design, the bulbs are brighter and hotter than those on a
series-wired string. As a result, these bulbs are inherently
more dangerous (more likely to start a ﬁre, for instance), but
if one bulb in a parallel-wired string fails or is removed, the
rest of the bulbs continue to glow. (A 25-bulb string of 4-W
bulbs results in a power of 100 W; the total power becomes
substantial when several strings are used.)
A new design was developed for so-called “miniature”
lights wired in series, to prevent the failure of one bulb from
extinguishing the entire string. The solution is to create a
connection (called a jumper) across the ﬁlament after it fails.
(If an alternate connection existed across the ﬁlament before

These and other household devices, such as the three-way lightbulb in Conceptual Example 28.6 and
the kitchen appliances shown in this chapter’s Puzzler, actually operate on alternating current (ac), to

28.3 Kirchhoff’s Rules
it failed, each bulb would represent a parallel circuit; in this
circuit, the current would ﬂow through the alternate connection, forming a short circuit, and the bulb would not glow.)
When the ﬁlament breaks in one of these miniature lightbulbs, 120 V appears across the bulb because no current is
present in the bulb and therefore no drop in potential occurs
across the other bulbs. Inside the lightbulb, a small loop covered by an insulating material is wrapped around the ﬁlament leads. An arc burns the insulation and connects the ﬁlament leads when 120 V appears across the bulb — that is,
when the ﬁlament fails. This “short” now completes the circuit through the bulb even though the ﬁlament is no longer
active (Fig. 28.10).

877

Suppose that all the bulbs in a 50-bulb miniature-light
string are operating. A 2.4-V potential drop occurs across each
bulb because the bulbs are in series. The power input to this
style of bulb is 0.34 W, so the total power supplied to the
string is only 17 W. We calculate the ﬁlament resistance at
the operating temperature to be (2.4 V)2/(0.34 W) ⫽ 17 ⍀.
When the bulb fails, the resistance across its terminals is reduced to zero because of the alternate jumper connection
mentioned in the preceding paragraph. All the other bulbs
not only stay on but glow more brightly because the total resistance of the string is reduced and consequently the current in
each bulb increases.
Let us assume that the operating resistance of a bulb remains at 17 ⍀ even though its temperature rises as a result of
the increased current. If one bulb fails, the potential drop
across each of the remaining bulbs increases to 2.45 V, the
current increases from 0.142 A to 0.145 A, and the power increases to 0.354 W. As more lights fail, the current keeps rising, the ﬁlament of each bulb operates at a higher temperature, and the lifetime of the bulb is reduced. It is therefore a
good idea to check for failed (nonglowing) bulbs in such a
series-wired string and replace them as soon as possible, in order to maximize the lifetimes of all the bulbs.

KIRCHHOFF’S RULES

As we saw in the preceding section, we can analyze simple circuits using the expression ⌬V ⫽ IR and the rules for series and parallel combinations of resistors.
Very often, however, it is not possible to reduce a circuit to a single loop. The procedure for analyzing more complex circuits is greatly simpliﬁed if we use two principles called Kirchhoff ’s rules:
1. The sum of the currents entering any junction in a circuit must equal the
sum of the currents leaving that junction:

⌺ I in ⫽ ⌺ I out

(28.9)

878

CHAPTER 28

2. The sum of the potential differences across all elements around any closed
circuit loop must be zero:

⌺

⌬V ⫽ 0

closed
loop

Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst rule is a statement of conservation of electric charge. All current that enters a given point in a circuit must leave that point because charge cannot build up at a point. If we apply this rule to the junction shown in Figure
28.11a, we obtain

Gustav Kirchhoff

(1824– 1887)
Kirchhoff, a professor at Heidelberg,
Germany, and Robert Bunsen invented the spectroscope and founded
the science of spectroscopy, which
we shall study in Chapter 40. They
discovered the elements cesium and
rubidium and invented astronomical
spectroscopy. Kirchhoff formulated
another Kirchhoff’s rule, namely, “a
cool substance will absorb light of the
same wavelengths that it emits when
hot.” (AIP ESVA/W. F. Meggers Collection)

QuickLab
Draw an arbitrarily shaped closed
loop that does not cross over itself.
Label ﬁve points on the loop a, b, c, d,
and e, and assign a random number
to each point. Now start at a and
work your way around the loop, calculating the difference between each
pair of adjacent numbers. Some of
these differences will be positive, and
some will be negative. Add the differences together, making sure you accurately keep track of the algebraic
signs. What is the sum of the differences all the way around the loop?

I1 ⫽ I2 ⫹ I3
Figure 28.11b represents a mechanical analog of this situation, in which water
ﬂows through a branched pipe having no leaks. The ﬂow rate into the pipe equals
the total ﬂow rate out of the two branches on the right.
Kirchhoff’s second rule follows from the law of conservation of energy. Let us
imagine moving a charge around the loop. When the charge returns to the starting point, the charge – circuit system must have the same energy as when the
charge started from it. The sum of the increases in energy in some circuit elements must equal the sum of the decreases in energy in other elements. The potential energy decreases whenever the charge moves through a potential drop ⫺IR
across a resistor or whenever it moves in the reverse direction through a source of
emf. The potential energy increases whenever the charge passes through a battery
from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. Kirchhoff’s second rule applies only for circuits in which an electric potential is deﬁned at each point; this
criterion may not be satisﬁed if changing electromagnetic ﬁelds are present, as we
shall see in Chapter 31.
In justifying our claim that Kirchhoff’s second rule is a statement of conservation of energy, we imagined carrying a charge around a loop. When applying this
rule, we imagine traveling around the loop and consider changes in electric potential,
rather than the changes in potential energy described in the previous paragraph.
You should note the following sign conventions when using the second rule:
• Because charges move from the high-potential end of a resistor to the low-

potential end, if a resistor is traversed in the direction of the current, the
change in potential ⌬V across the resistor is ⫺IR (Fig. 28.12a).
• If a resistor is traversed in the direction opposite the current, the change in potential ⌬V across the resistor is ⫹ IR (Fig. 28.12b).
• If a source of emf (assumed to have zero internal resistance) is traversed in the
direction of the emf (from ⫺ to ⫹), the change in potential ⌬V is ⫹
(Fig.
28.12c). The emf of the battery increases the electric potential as we move
through it in this direction.
• If a source of emf (assumed to have zero internal resistance) is traversed in the
direction opposite the emf (from ⫹ to ⫺), the change in potential ⌬V is ⫺
(Fig. 28.12d). In this case the emf of the battery reduces the electric potential as
we move through it.

Limitations exist on the numbers of times you can usefully apply Kirchhoff’s
rules in analyzing a given circuit. You can use the junction rule as often as you
need, so long as each time you write an equation you include in it a current that
has not been used in a preceding junction-rule equation. In general, the number
of times you can use the junction rule is one fewer than the number of junction

points in the circuit. You can apply the loop rule as often as needed, so long as a
new circuit element (resistor or battery) or a new current appears in each new
equation. In general, in order to solve a particular circuit problem, the number of independent equations you need to obtain from the two rules equals
the number of unknown currents.
Complex networks containing many loops and junctions generate great numbers of independent linear equations and a correspondingly great number of unknowns. Such situations can be handled formally through the use of matrix algebra. Computer programs can also be written to solve for the unknowns.
The following examples illustrate how to use Kirchhoff’s rules. In all cases, it is
assumed that the circuits have reached steady-state conditions — that is, the currents in the various branches are constant. Any capacitor acts as an open circuit;
that is, the current in the branch containing the capacitor is zero under steadystate conditions.

Problem-Solving Hints
Kirchhoff’s Rules
• Draw a circuit diagram, and label all the known and unknown quantities.
You must assign a direction to the current in each branch of the circuit. Do
not be alarmed if you guess the direction of a current incorrectly; your result will be negative, but its magnitude will be correct. Although the assignment
of current directions is arbitrary, you must adhere rigorously to the assigned
directions when applying Kirchhoff’s rules.
• Apply the junction rule to any junctions in the circuit that provide new relationships among the various currents.

CHAPTER 28

Direct Current Circuits

• Apply the loop rule to as many loops in the circuit as are needed to solve for
the unknowns. To apply this rule, you must correctly identify the change in
potential as you imagine crossing each element in traversing the closed loop
(either clockwise or counterclockwise). Watch out for errors in sign!
• Solve the equations simultaneously for the unknown quantities.

A single-loop circuit contains two resistors and two batteries,

Solution

We do not need Kirchhoff’s rules to analyze this
simple circuit, but let us use them anyway just to see how they
are applied. There are no junctions in this single-loop circuit;
thus, the current is the same in all elements. Let us assume
that the current is clockwise, as shown in Figure 28.13. Traversing the circuit in the clockwise direction, starting at a, we
see that a : b represents a potential change of ⫹ 1 , b : c
represents a potential change of ⫺IR 1 , c : d represents a potential change of ⫺ 2 , and d : a represents a potential
change of ⫺IR 2 . Applying Kirchhoff’s loop rule gives

charged by the 12-V battery. If we had included the internal
resistances of the batteries in our analysis, some of the power
would appear as internal energy in the batteries; as a result,
we would have found that less power was being delivered to
the 6-V battery.

We now have one equation with three unknowns — I 1 , I 2 , and
I3 . There are three loops in the circuit — abcda, befcb, and
aefda. We therefore need only two loop equations to determine the unknown currents. (The third loop equation would
give no new information.) Applying Kirchhoff’s loop rule to
loops abcda and befcb and traversing these loops clockwise, we
obtain the expressions

Note that in loop befcb we obtain a positive value when traversing the 6-⍀ resistor because our direction of travel is opposite
the assumed direction of I 1 .
Expressions (1), (2), and (3) represent three independent
equations with three unknowns. Substituting Equation (1)
into Equation (2) gives

⫺12 V ⫽ ⫺(3 ⍀)I 1 ⫹ (2 ⍀)I 2

Using this value of I 1 in Equation (5) gives a value for I 2 :

Dividing each term in Equation (3) by 2 and rearranging
gives

RC CIRCUITS

So far we have been analyzing steady-state circuits, in which the current is constant. In circuits containing capacitors, the current may vary in time. A circuit containing a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor is called an RC circuit.

Charging a Capacitor
Let us assume that the capacitor in Figure 28.16 is initially uncharged. There is no
current while switch S is open (Fig. 28.16b). If the switch is closed at t ⫽ 0, however, charge begins to ﬂow, setting up a current in the circuit, and the capacitor
begins to charge.4 Note that during charging, charges do not jump across the capacitor plates because the gap between the plates represents an open circuit. Instead, charge is transferred between each plate and its connecting wire due to the
electric ﬁeld established in the wires by the battery, until the capacitor is fully
charged. As the plates become charged, the potential difference across the capacitor increases. The value of the maximum charge depends on the voltage of the
battery. Once the maximum charge is reached, the current in the circuit is zero
because the potential difference across the capacitor matches that supplied by the
battery.
To analyze this circuit quantitatively, let us apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to the
circuit after the switch is closed. Traversing the loop clockwise gives

q
⫺ IR ⫽ 0

(28.11)

where q/C is the potential difference across the capacitor and IR is the potential

In previous discussions of capacitors, we assumed a steady-state situation, in which no current was
present in any branch of the circuit containing a capacitor. Now we are considering the case before the
steady-state condition is realized; in this situation, charges are moving and a current exists in the wires
connected to the capacitor.

difference across the resistor. We have used the sign conventions discussed earlier
for the signs on and IR. For the capacitor, notice that we are traveling in the direction from the positive plate to the negative plate; this represents a decrease in
potential. Thus, we use a negative sign for this voltage in Equation 28.11. Note that
q and I are instantaneous values that depend on time (as opposed to steady-state values) as the capacitor is being charged.
We can use Equation 28.11 to ﬁnd the initial current in the circuit and the
maximum charge on the capacitor. At the instant the switch is closed (t ⫽ 0), the
charge on the capacitor is zero, and from Equation 28.11 we ﬁnd that the initial
current in the circuit I 0 is a maximum and is equal to

␧

I0 ⫽

␧
R

(current at t ⫽ 0)

(28.12)

Maximum current

At this time, the potential difference from the battery terminals appears entirely
across the resistor. Later, when the capacitor is charged to its maximum value Q ,
charges cease to ﬂow, the current in the circuit is zero, and the potential difference from the battery terminals appears entirely across the capacitor. Substituting
I ⫽ 0 into Equation 28.11 gives the charge on the capacitor at this time:
Q⫽C

␧

(maximum charge)

(28.13)

To determine analytical expressions for the time dependence of the charge
and current, we must solve Equation 28.11 — a single equation containing two variables, q and I. The current in all parts of the series circuit must be the same. Thus,
the current in the resistance R must be the same as the current ﬂowing out of and
into the capacitor plates. This current is equal to the time rate of change of the
charge on the capacitor plates. Thus, we substitute I ⫽ dq /dt into Equation 28.11
and rearrange the equation:

Equations 28.14 and 28.15, is called the time constant ␶ of the circuit. It represents the time it takes the current to decrease to 1/e of its initial value; that is, in a

the battery appears as internal energy in the resistor.

Discharging a Capacitor
Now let us consider the circuit shown in Figure 28.18, which consists of a capacitor carrying an initial charge Q , a resistor, and a switch. The initial charge Q is
not the same as the maximum charge Q in the previous discussion, unless the discharge occurs after the capacitor is fully charged (as described earlier). When the
switch is open, a potential difference Q /C exists across the capacitor and there is
zero potential difference across the resistor because I ⫽ 0. If the switch is closed
at t ⫽ 0, the capacitor begins to discharge through the resistor. At some time t
during the discharge, the current in the circuit is I and the charge on the capacitor is q (Fig. 28.18b). The circuit in Figure 28.18 is the same as the circuit in Figure 28.16 except for the absence of the battery. Thus, we eliminate the emf
from Equation 28.11 to obtain the appropriate loop equation for the circuit in
Figure 28.18:

Many automobiles are equipped with windshield wipers that
can operate intermittently during a light rainfall. How does
the operation of such wipers depend on the charging and discharging of a capacitor?

through a multiposition switch. As it increases with time, the
voltage across the capacitor reaches a point at which it triggers the wipers and discharges, ready to begin another charging cycle. The time interval between the individual sweeps of
the wipers is determined by the value of the time constant.

Solution The wipers are part of an RC circuit whose time

After how many time constants is the current in

Answer

Energy Delivered to a Resistor

A 5.00-␮ F capacitor is charged to a potential difference of
800 V and then discharged through a 25.0-k⍀ resistor. How
much energy is delivered to the resistor in the time it takes to
fully discharge the capacitor?

Solution We shall solve this problem in two ways. The ﬁrst
way is to note that the initial energy in the circuit equals the
energy stored in the capacitor, C 2/2 (see Eq. 26.11). Once
the capacitor is fully discharged, the energy stored in it is
zero. Because energy is conserved, the initial energy stored in
the capacitor is transformed into internal energy in the resistor. Using the given values of C and , we ﬁnd

Energy ⫽

1.60 J

The second way, which is more difﬁcult but perhaps more
instructive, is to note that as the capacitor discharges through
the resistor, the rate at which energy is delivered to the resistor is given by I 2R, where I is the instantaneous current given
by Equation 28.18. Because power is deﬁned as the time rate
of change of energy, we conclude that the energy delivered to
the resistor must equal the time integral of I 2R dt:

The Ammeter
A device that measures current is called an ammeter. The current to be measured
must pass directly through the ammeter, so the ammeter must be connected in se-

Direct Current Circuits

ries with other elements in the circuit, as shown in Figure 28.21. When using an
ammeter to measure direct currents, you must be sure to connect it so that current
enters the instrument at the positive terminal and exits at the negative terminal.
Ideally, an ammeter should have zero resistance so that the current being measured is not altered. In the circuit shown in Figure 28.21, this condition
requires that the resistance of the ammeter be much less than R 1 ⫹ R 2 . Because
any ammeter always has some internal resistance, the presence of the ammeter in
the circuit slightly reduces the current from the value it would have in the meter’s
absence.

The Voltmeter
A device that measures potential difference is called a voltmeter. The potential
difference between any two points in a circuit can be measured by attaching the
terminals of the voltmeter between these points without breaking the circuit, as
shown in Figure 28.22. The potential difference across resistor R 2 is measured by
connecting the voltmeter in parallel with R 2 . Again, it is necessary to observe the
polarity of the instrument. The positive terminal of the voltmeter must be connected to the end of the resistor that is at the higher potential, and the negative
terminal to the end of the resistor at the lower potential.
An ideal voltmeter has inﬁnite resistance so that no current passes
through it. In Figure 28.22, this condition requires that the voltmeter have a resistance much greater than R 2 . In practice, if this condition is not met, corrections
should be made for the known resistance of the voltmeter.

The Galvanometer
The galvanometer is the main component in analog ammeters and voltmeters.
Figure 28.23a illustrates the essential features of a common type called the
D’Arsonval galvanometer. It consists of a coil of wire mounted so that it is free to rotate on a pivot in a magnetic ﬁeld provided by a permanent magnet. The basic op-

eration of the galvanometer makes use of the fact that a torque acts on a current
loop in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld (Chapter 29). The torque experienced by
the coil is proportional to the current through it: the larger the current, the
greater the torque and the more the coil rotates before the spring tightens
enough to stop the rotation. Hence, the deﬂection of a needle attached to the coil
is proportional to the current. Once the instrument is properly calibrated, it can
be used in conjunction with other circuit elements to measure either currents or
potential differences.
A typical off-the-shelf galvanometer is often not suitable for use as an ammeter,
primarily because it has a resistance of about 60 ⍀. An ammeter resistance this
great considerably alters the current in a circuit. You can understand this by considering the following example: The current in a simple series circuit containing a
3-V battery and a 3-⍀ resistor is 1 A. If you insert a 60-⍀ galvanometer in this circuit to measure the current, the total resistance becomes 63 ⍀ and the current is
reduced to 0.048 A!
A second factor that limits the use of a galvanometer as an ammeter is the fact
that a typical galvanometer gives a full-scale deﬂection for currents of the order of
1 mA or less. Consequently, such a galvanometer cannot be used directly to measure currents greater than this value. However, it can be converted to a useful ammeter by placing a shunt resistor R p in parallel with the galvanometer, as shown in
Figure 28.24a. The value of R p must be much less than the galvanometer resistance so that most of the current to be measured passes through the shunt resistor.
A galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter by adding an external resistor
R s in series with it, as shown in Figure 28.24b. In this case, the external resistor
must have a value much greater than the resistance of the galvanometer to ensure
that the galvanometer does not signiﬁcantly alter the voltage being measured.

The Wheatstone Bridge
An unknown resistance value can be accurately measured using a circuit known as
a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 28.25). This circuit consists of the unknown resistance
R x , three known resistances R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 (where R 1 is a calibrated variable resistor), a galvanometer, and a battery. The known resistor R 1 is varied until the galvanometer reading is zero — that is, until there is no current from a to b. Under
this condition the bridge is said to be balanced. Because the electric potential at

symbol for resistor R 1 indicates that
the value of this resistor can be varied by the person operating the

point a must equal the potential at point b when the bridge is balanced, the potential difference across R 1 must equal the potential difference across R 2 . Likewise,
the potential difference across R 3 must equal the potential difference across R x .

The strain gauge, a device used for
experimental stress analysis, consists of a thin coiled wire bonded to
a ﬂexible plastic backing. The
gauge measures stresses by detecting changes in the resistance of the
coil as the strip bends. Resistance
measurements are made with this
device as one element of a Wheatstone bridge. Strain gauges are
commonly used in modern electronic balances to measure the
masses of objects.

A number of similar devices also operate on the principle of null measurement (that is, adjustment of one circuit element to make the galvanometer read
zero). One example is the capacitance bridge used to measure unknown capacitances. These devices do not require calibrated meters and can be used with any
voltage source.
Wheatstone bridges are not useful for resistances above 105 ⍀, but modern
electronic instruments can measure resistances as high as 1012 ⍀. Such instruments have an extremely high resistance between their input terminals. For example, input resistances of 1010 ⍀ are common in most digital multimeters, which are
devices that are used to measure voltage, current, and resistance (Fig. 28.26).

The Potentiometer

␧

A potentiometer is a circuit that is used to measure an unknown emf x by comparison with a known emf. In Figure 28.27, point d represents a sliding contact
that is used to vary the resistance (and hence the potential difference) between
points a and d. The other required components are a galvanometer, a battery of
known emf 0 , and a battery of unknown emf x .
With the currents in the directions shown in Figure 28.27, we see from Kirchhoff’s junction rule that the current in the resistor R x is I ⫺ I x , where I is the current in the left branch (through the battery of emf 0 ) and Ix is the current in the
right branch. Kirchhoff’s loop rule applied to loop abcda traversed clockwise gives

Because current Ix passes through it, the galvanometer displays a nonzero reading.
The sliding contact at d is now adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero (indicating a balanced circuit and that the potentiometer is another null-measurement device). Under this condition, the current in the galvanometer is zero, and the potential difference between a and d must equal the unknown emf x :

Next, the battery of unknown emf is replaced by a standard battery of known

HOUSEHOLD WIRING AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY

Household circuits represent a practical application of some of the ideas presented in this chapter. In our world of electrical appliances, it is useful to understand the power requirements and limitations of conventional electrical systems
and the safety measures that prevent accidents.
In a conventional installation, the utility company distributes electric power to
individual homes by means of a pair of wires, with each home connected in parallel to these wires. One wire is called the live wire,5 as illustrated in Figure 28.28, and
the other is called the neutral wire. The potential difference between these two
wires is about 120 V. This voltage alternates in time, with the neutral wire connected to ground and the potential of the live wire oscillating relative to ground.
Much of what we have learned so far for the constant-emf situation (direct current) can also be applied to the alternating current that power companies supply
to businesses and households. (Alternating voltage and current are discussed in
Chapter 33.)
A meter is connected in series with the live wire entering the house to record
the household’s usage of electricity. After the meter, the wire splits so that there
are several separate circuits in parallel distributed throughout the house. Each circuit contains a circuit breaker (or, in older installations, a fuse). The wire and circuit breaker for each circuit are carefully selected to meet the current demands
for that circuit. If a circuit is to carry currents as large as 30 A, a heavy wire and an
appropriate circuit breaker must be selected to handle this current. A circuit used
to power only lamps and small appliances often requires only 15 A. Each circuit
has its own circuit breaker to accommodate various load conditions.
As an example, consider a circuit in which a toaster oven, a microwave oven,
and a coffee maker are connected (corresponding to R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 in Figure
28.28 and as shown in the chapter-opening photograph). We can calculate the current drawn by each appliance by using the expression ᏼ ⫽ I ⌬V. The toaster oven,
rated at 1 000 W, draws a current of 1 000 W/120 V ⫽ 8.33 A. The microwave
oven, rated at 1 300 W, draws 10.8 A, and the coffee maker, rated at 800 W, draws
6.67 A. If the three appliances are operated simultaneously, they draw a total cur5

rent of 25.8 A. Therefore, the circuit should be wired to handle at least this much
current. If the rating of the circuit breaker protecting the circuit is too small — say,
20 A — the breaker will be tripped when the third appliance is turned on, preventing all three appliances from operating. To avoid this situation, the toaster oven
and coffee maker can be operated on one 20-A circuit and the microwave oven on
a separate 20-A circuit.
Many heavy-duty appliances, such as electric ranges and clothes dryers, require
240 V for their operation (Fig. 28.29). The power company supplies this voltage by
providing a third wire that is 120 V below ground potential. The potential difference between this live wire and the other live wire (which is 120 V above ground
potential) is 240 V. An appliance that operates from a 240-V line requires half the
current of one operating from a 120-V line; therefore, smaller wires can be used in
the higher-voltage circuit without overheating.

Electrical Safety

Figure 28.30

A three-pronged
power cord for a 120-V appliance.

When the live wire of an electrical outlet is connected directly to ground, the circuit is completed and a short-circuit condition exists. A short circuit occurs when almost zero resistance exists between two points at different potentials; this results in
a very large current. When this happens accidentally, a properly operating circuit
breaker opens the circuit and no damage is done. However, a person in contact
with ground can be electrocuted by touching the live wire of a frayed cord or
other exposed conductor. An exceptionally good (although very dangerous)
ground contact is made when the person either touches a water pipe (normally at
ground potential) or stands on the ground with wet feet. The latter situation represents a good ground because normal, nondistilled water is a conductor because
it contains a large number of ions associated with impurities. This situation should
be avoided at all cost.
Electric shock can result in fatal burns, or it can cause the muscles of vital organs, such as the heart, to malfunction. The degree of damage to the body depends on the magnitude of the current, the length of time it acts, the part of the
body touched by the live wire, and the part of the body through which the current
passes. Currents of 5 mA or less cause a sensation of shock but ordinarily do little
or no damage. If the current is larger than about 10 mA, the muscles contract and
the person may be unable to release the live wire. If a current of about 100 mA
passes through the body for only a few seconds, the result can be fatal. Such a
large current paralyzes the respiratory muscles and prevents breathing. In some
cases, currents of about 1 A through the body can produce serious (and sometimes fatal) burns. In practice, no contact with live wires is regarded as safe whenever the voltage is greater than 24 V.
Many 120-V outlets are designed to accept a three-pronged power cord such as
the one shown in Figure 28.30. (This feature is required in all new electrical installations.) One of these prongs is the live wire at a nominal potential of 120 V. The
second, called the “neutral,” is nominally at 0 V and carries current to ground.
The third, round prong is a safety ground wire that normally carries no current
but is both grounded and connected directly to the casing of the appliance. If the
live wire is accidentally shorted to the casing (which can occur if the wire insulation wears off), most of the current takes the low-resistance path through the appliance to ground. In contrast, if the casing of the appliance is not properly
grounded and a short occurs, anyone in contact with the appliance experiences an
electric shock because the body provides a low-resistance path to ground.

Summary

Special power outlets called ground-fault interrupters (GFIs) are now being used
in kitchens, bathrooms, basements, exterior outlets, and other hazardous areas of
new homes. These devices are designed to protect persons from electric shock by
sensing small currents (⬇ 5 mA) leaking to ground. (The principle of their operation is described in Chapter 31.) When an excessive leakage current is detected,
the current is shut off in less than 1 ms.

If it is possible to combine resistors into series or parallel equivalents, the preceding two equations make it easy to determine how the resistors inﬂuence the rest of
the circuit.
Circuits involving more than one loop are conveniently analyzed with the use
of Kirchhoff ’s rules:
1. The sum of the currents entering any junction in an electric circuit must equal
the sum of the currents leaving that junction:

⌺ I in ⫽ ⌺ I out

(28.9)

2. The sum of the potential differences across all elements around any circuit
loop must be zero:

⌺

⌬V ⫽ 0

The ﬁrst rule is a statement of conservation of charge; the second is equivalent to
a statement of conservation of energy.
When a resistor is traversed in the direction of the current, the change in potential ⌬V across the resistor is ⫺IR. When a resistor is traversed in the direction
opposite the current, ⌬V ⫽ ⫹IR . When a source of emf is traversed in the direction of the emf (negative terminal to positive terminal), the change in potential is
⫹ . When a source of emf is traversed opposite the emf (positive to negative),
the change in potential is ⫺ . The use of these rules together with Equations 28.9
and 28.10 allows you to analyze electric circuits.

38. A typical galvanometer, which requires a current of
1.50 mA for full-scale deﬂection and has a resistance of
75.0 ⍀, can be used to measure currents of much
greater values. A relatively small shunt resistor is wired
in parallel with the galvanometer (refer to Fig. 28.24a)
so that an operator can measure large currents without
causing damage to the galvanometer. Most of the current then ﬂows through the shunt resistor. Calculate the
value of the shunt resistor that enables the galvanometer to be used to measure a current of 1.00 A at fullscale deﬂection. (Hint: Use Kirchhoff’s rules.)
39. The galvanometer described in the preceding problem
can be used to measure voltages. In this case a large resistor is wired in series with the galvanometer in a way
similar to that shown in Figure 28.24b. This arrangement, in effect, limits the current that ﬂows through the
galvanometer when large voltages are applied. Most of
the potential drop occurs across the resistor placed in
series. Calculate the value of the resistor that enables
the galvanometer to measure an applied voltage of
25.0 V at full-scale deﬂection.

40. A galvanometer with a full-scale sensitivity of 1.00 mA
requires a 900-⍀ series resistor to make a voltmeter
reading full scale when 1.00 V is measured across the

same galvanometer into a 50.0-V (full-scale) voltmeter?
41. Assume that a galvanometer has an internal resistance
of 60.0 ⍀ and requires a current of 0.500 mA to produce full-scale deﬂection. What resistance must be connected in parallel with the galvanometer if the combination is to serve as an ammeter that has a full-scale
deﬂection for a current of 0.100 A?
42. A Wheatstone bridge of the type shown in Figure 28.25
is used to make a precise measurement of the resistance

Rx?
43. Consider the case in which the Wheatstone bridge
shown in Figure 28.25 is unbalanced. Calculate the current through the galvanometer when R x ⫽ R 3 ⫽
7.00 ⍀, R 2 ⫽ 21.0 ⍀, and R 1 ⫽ 14.0 ⍀. Assume that the
voltage across the bridge is 70.0 V, and neglect the galvanometer’s resistance.
44. Review Problem. A Wheatstone bridge can be used to
measure the strain (⌬L/L i ) of a wire (see Section 12.4),
where L i is the length before stretching, L is the length
after stretching, and ⌬L ⫽ L ⫺ L i . Let ␣ ⫽ ⌬L/L i .
Show that the resistance is R ⫽ R i (1 ⫹ 2␣ ⫹ ␣ 2 ) for

battery is replaced by an unknown emf, the galvanometer reads zero when the resistance is adjusted to 48.0 ⍀.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
28.1 Bulb R 1 becomes brighter. Connecting b to c “shorts
out” bulb R 2 and changes the total resistance of the circuit from R 1 ⫹ R 2 to just R 1 . Because the resistance has
decreased (and the potential difference supplied by the
battery does not change), the current through the battery increases. This means that the current through bulb
R 1 increases, and bulb R 1 glows more brightly. Bulb R 2
goes out because the new piece of wire provides an almost resistance-free path for the current; hence, essentially zero current exists in bulb R 2 .
28.2 Adding another series resistor increases the total resistance of the circuit and thus reduces the current in the
battery. The potential difference across the battery terminals would increase because the reduced current results in a smaller voltage decrease across the internal resistance.

If the second resistor were connected in parallel, the
total resistance of the circuit would decrease, and an increase in current through the battery would result. The
potential difference across the terminals would decrease
because the increased current results in a greater voltage decrease across the internal resistance.
28.3 They must be in parallel because if one burns out, the
other continues to operate. If they were in series, one
failed headlamp would interrupt the current throughout the entire circuit, including the other headlamp.
28.4 Because the circuit breaker trips and opens the circuit
when the current in that circuit exceeds a certain preset
value, it must be in series to sense the appropriate current (see Fig. 28.28).

any historians of science believe that the compass, which uses a magnetic
needle, was used in China as early as the 13th century B.C., its invention being of Arabic or Indian origin. The early Greeks knew about magnetism as
early as 800 B.C. They discovered that the stone magnetite (Fe3O4 ) attracts pieces
of iron. Legend ascribes the name magnetite to the shepherd Magnes, the nails of
whose shoes and the tip of whose staff stuck fast to chunks of magnetite while he
pastured his ﬂocks.
In 1269 a Frenchman named Pierre de Maricourt mapped out the directions
taken by a needle placed at various points on the surface of a spherical natural
magnet. He found that the directions formed lines that encircled the sphere and
passed through two points diametrically opposite each other, which he called the
poles of the magnet. Subsequent experiments showed that every magnet, regardless
of its shape, has two poles, called north and south poles, that exert forces on other
magnetic poles just as electric charges exert forces on one another. That is, like
poles repel each other, and unlike poles attract each other.
The poles received their names because of the way a magnet behaves in the
presence of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. If a bar magnet is suspended from its midpoint and can swing freely in a horizontal plane, it will rotate until its north pole
points to the Earth’s geographic North Pole and its south pole points to the
Earth’s geographic South Pole.1 (The same idea is used in the construction of a
simple compass.)
In 1600 William Gilbert (1540 – 1603) extended de Maricourt’s experiments to
a variety of materials. Using the fact that a compass needle orients in preferred directions, he suggested that the Earth itself is a large permanent magnet. In 1750
experimenters used a torsion balance to show that magnetic poles exert attractive
or repulsive forces on each other and that these forces vary as the inverse square
of the distance between interacting poles. Although the force between two magnetic poles is similar to the force between two electric charges, there is an important difference. Electric charges can be isolated (witness the electron and proton),
whereas a single magnetic pole has never been isolated. That is, magnetic
poles are always found in pairs. All attempts thus far to detect an isolated magnetic pole have been unsuccessful. No matter how many times a permanent magnet is cut in two, each piece always has a north and a south pole. (There is some
theoretical basis for speculating that magnetic monopoles — isolated north or south
poles — may exist in nature, and attempts to detect them currently make up an active experimental ﬁeld of investigation.)
The relationship between magnetism and electricity was discovered in 1819
when, during a lecture demonstration, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted found that an electric current in a wire deﬂected a nearby compass needle.2
Shortly thereafter, André Ampère (1775 – 1836) formulated quantitative laws for
calculating the magnetic force exerted by one current-carrying electrical conductor on another. He also suggested that on the atomic level, electric current loops
are responsible for all magnetic phenomena.
In the 1820s, further connections between electricity and magnetism were
demonstrated by Faraday and independently by Joseph Henry (1797 – 1878). They

Note that the Earth’s geographic North Pole is magnetically a south pole, whereas its geographic
South Pole is magnetically a north pole. Because opposite magnetic poles attract each other, the pole on
a magnet that is attracted to the Earth’s geographic North Pole is the magnet’s north pole and the pole
attracted to the Earth’s geographic South Pole is the magnet’s south pole.

The same discovery was reported in 1802 by an Italian jurist, Gian Dominico Romognosi, but was
overlooked, probably because it was published in the newspaper Gazetta de Trentino rather than in a
scholarly journal.

showed that an electric current can be produced in a circuit either by moving a
magnet near the circuit or by changing the current in a nearby circuit. These observations demonstrate that a changing magnetic ﬁeld creates an electric ﬁeld.
Years later, theoretical work by Maxwell showed that the reverse is also true: A
changing electric ﬁeld creates a magnetic ﬁeld.
A similarity between electric and magnetic effects has provided methods of
making permanent magnets. In Chapter 23 we learned that when rubber and wool
are rubbed together, both become charged — one positively and the other negatively. In an analogous fashion, one can magnetize an unmagnetized piece of iron
by stroking it with a magnet. Magnetism can also be induced in iron (and other
materials) by other means. For example, if a piece of unmagnetized iron is placed
near (but not touching) a strong magnet, the unmagnetized piece eventually becomes magnetized.
This chapter examines the forces that act on moving charges and on currentcarrying wires in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The source of the magnetic
ﬁeld itself is described in Chapter 30.

QuickLab
If iron or steel is left in a weak magnetic ﬁeld (such as that due to the
Earth) long enough, it can become
magnetized. Use a compass to see if
you can detect a magnetic ﬁeld near
a steel ﬁle cabinet, cast iron radiator,
or some other piece of ferrous metal
that has been in one position for several years.

THE MAGNETIC FIELD

29.1
12.2

In our study of electricity, we described the interactions between charged objects
in terms of electric ﬁelds. Recall that an electric ﬁeld surrounds any stationary or
moving electric charge. In addition to an electric ﬁeld, the region of space surrounding any moving electric charge also contains a magnetic ﬁeld, as we shall see
in Chapter 30. A magnetic ﬁeld also surrounds any magnetic substance.
Historically, the symbol B has been used to represent a magnetic ﬁeld, and
this is the notation we use in this text. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld B at any
location is the direction in which a compass needle points at that location. Figure
29.1 shows how the magnetic ﬁeld of a bar magnet can be traced with the aid of a
compass. Note that the magnetic ﬁeld lines outside the magnet point away from
north poles and toward south poles. One can display magnetic ﬁeld patterns of a
bar magnet using small iron ﬁlings, as shown in Figure 29.2.
We can deﬁne a magnetic ﬁeld B at some point in space in terms of the magnetic force FB that the ﬁeld exerts on a test object, for which we use a charged particle moving with a velocity v. For the time being, let us assume that no electric or
gravitational ﬁelds are present at the location of the test object. Experiments on
various charged particles moving in a magnetic ﬁeld give the following results:
• The magnitude FB of the magnetic force exerted on the particle is proportional

to the charge q and to the speed v of the particle.
These refrigerator magnets are similar to a series of very short bar
magnets placed end to end. If you
slide the back of one refrigerator
magnet in a circular path across
the back of another one, you can
feel a vibration as the two series of
north and south poles move across
each other.

• The magnitude and direction of FB depend on the velocity of the particle and

on the magnitude and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld B.
• When a charged particle moves parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld vector, the mag-

netic force acting on the particle is zero.

• When the particle’s velocity vector makes any angle   0 with the magnetic

ﬁeld, the magnetic force acts in a direction perpendicular to both v and B; that
is, FB is perpendicular to the plane formed by v and B (Fig. 29.3a).

CHAPTER 29

Magnetic Fields

The blue-white arc in this photograph indicates the circular path followed by an electron beam moving in a magnetic ﬁeld. The
vessel contains gas at very low pressure, and
the beam is made visible as the electrons
collide with the gas atoms, which then emit
visible light. The magnetic ﬁeld is produced by two coils (not shown). The apparatus can be used to measure the ratio e/me
for the electron.

• The magnetic force exerted on a positive charge is in the direction opposite the

direction of the magnetic force exerted on a negative charge moving in the
same direction (Fig. 29.3b).
• The magnitude of the magnetic force exerted on the moving particle is proportional to sin , where  is the angle the particle’s velocity vector makes with the
direction of B.
We can summarize these observations by writing the magnetic force in the
form
FB  qv ⴛ B
(29.1)
where the direction of FB is in the direction of v ⴛ B if q is positive, which by deﬁnition of the cross product (see Section 11.2) is perpendicular to both v and B.
We can regard this equation as an operational deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld at
some point in space. That is, the magnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned in terms of the force
acting on a moving charged particle.
Figure 29.4 reviews the right-hand rule for determining the direction of the
cross product v ⴛ B. You point the four ﬁngers of your right hand along the direction of v with the palm facing B and curl them toward B. The extended thumb,
which is at a right angle to the ﬁngers, points in the direction of v ⴛ B. Because

The direction of v ⴛ B is the direction in which the thumb points. (a) If

the direction of v ⴛ B if q is negative (Fig. 29.4b). (If you need more help understanding the cross product, you should review pages 333 to 334, including Fig. 11.8.)
The magnitude of the magnetic force is
F B  兩 q 兩vB sin 

(29.2)

where  is the smaller angle between v and B. From this expression, we see that F
is zero when v is parallel or antiparallel to B (  0 or 180°) and maximum
(F B, max  兩 q 兩vB) when v is perpendicular to B (  90).

Quick Quiz 29.1
What is the maximum work that a constant magnetic ﬁeld B can perform on a charge q
moving through the ﬁeld with velocity v?

There are several important differences between electric and magnetic forces:
• The electric force acts in the direction of the electric ﬁeld, whereas the mag-

netic force acts perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.
• The electric force acts on a charged particle regardless of whether the particle is
moving, whereas the magnetic force acts on a charged particle only when the
particle is in motion.
• The electric force does work in displacing a charged particle, whereas the magnetic force associated with a steady magnetic ﬁeld does no work when a particle
is displaced.

Differences between electric and
magnetic forces

From the last statement and on the basis of the work – kinetic energy theorem,
we conclude that the kinetic energy of a charged particle moving through a magnetic ﬁeld cannot be altered by the magnetic ﬁeld alone. In other words,
when a charged particle moves with a velocity v through a magnetic ﬁeld, the
ﬁeld can alter the direction of the velocity vector but cannot change the speed
or kinetic energy of the particle.
From Equation 29.2, we see that the SI unit of magnetic ﬁeld is the newton
per coulomb-meter per second, which is called the tesla (T):

MAGNETIC FORCE ACTING ON A
CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR

If a magnetic force is exerted on a single charged particle when the particle moves
through a magnetic ﬁeld, it should not surprise you that a current-carrying wire
also experiences a force when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. This follows from the
fact that the current is a collection of many charged particles in motion; hence,
the resultant force exerted by the ﬁeld on the wire is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted on all the charged particles making up the current. The force
exerted on the particles is transmitted to the wire when the particles collide with
the atoms making up the wire.
Before we continue our discussion, some explanation of the notation used in
this book is in order. To indicate the direction of B in illustrations, we sometimes
present perspective views, such as those in Figures 29.5, 29.6a, and 29.7. In ﬂat il-

lustrations, such as in Figure 29.6b to d, we depict a magnetic ﬁeld directed into
the page with blue crosses, which represent the tails of arrows shot perpendicularly
and away from you. In this case, we call the ﬁeld Bin , where the subscript “in” indicates “into the page.” If B is perpendicular and directed out of the page, we use a
series of blue dots, which represent the tips of arrows coming toward you (see Fig.
P29.56). In this case, we call the ﬁeld Bout . If B lies in the plane of the page, we
use a series of blue ﬁeld lines with arrowheads, as shown in Figure 29.8.
One can demonstrate the magnetic force acting on a current-carrying conductor by hanging a wire between the poles of a magnet, as shown in Figure 29.6a. For
ease in visualization, part of the horseshoe magnet in part (a) is removed to show
the end face of the south pole in parts (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 29.6. The magnetic ﬁeld is directed into the page and covers the region within the shaded circles. When the current in the wire is zero, the wire remains vertical, as shown in
Figure 29.6b. However, when a current directed upward ﬂows in the wire, as shown
in Figure 29.6c, the wire deﬂects to the left. If we reverse the current, as shown in
Figure 29.6d, the wire deﬂects to the right.
Let us quantify this discussion by considering a straight segment of wire of
length L and cross-sectional area A, carrying a current I in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B, as shown in Figure 29.7. The magnetic force exerted on a charge q moving
with a drift velocity vd is q vd ⴛ B. To ﬁnd the total force acting on the wire, we
multiply the force q vd ⴛ B exerted on one charge by the number of charges in
the segment. Because the volume of the segment is AL, the number of charges in
the segment is nAL, where n is the number of charges per unit volume. Hence,
the total magnetic force on the wire of length L is

Now let us consider an arbitrarily shaped wire segment of uniform crosssection in a magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 29.8. It follows from Equation 29.3

We can consider Equation 29.4 as an alternative deﬁnition of B. That is, we can deﬁne the magnetic ﬁeld B in terms of a measurable force exerted on a current element, where the force is a maximum when B is perpendicular to the element and
zero when B is parallel to the element.
To calculate the total force FB acting on the wire shown in Figure 29.8, we integrate Equation 29.4 over the length of the wire:

where a and b represent the end points of the wire. When this integration is carried out, the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld and the direction the ﬁeld makes
with the vector ds (in other words, with the orientation of the element) may differ
at different points.
Now let us consider two special cases involving Equation 29.5. In both cases,
the magnetic ﬁeld is taken to be constant in magnitude and direction.
Case 1 A curved wire carries a current I and is located in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B, as shown in Figure 29.9a. Because the ﬁeld is uniform, we can take B outside the integral in Equation 29.5, and we obtain

29.2 Magnetic Force Acting on a Current-Carrying Conductor

But the quantity 冕ba ds represents the vector sum of all the length elements from a to
b. From the law of vector addition, the sum equals the vector L , directed from a to
b. Therefore, Equation 29.6 reduces to
FB  I L ⴛ B

(29.7)

Case 2 An arbitrarily shaped closed loop carrying a current I is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 29.9b. We can again express the force acting on the loop in the form of Equation 29.6, but this time we must take the vector
sum of the length elements ds over the entire loop:
FB  I

冢冖 ds冣 ⴛ B

Because the set of length elements forms a closed polygon, the vector sum must be
zero. This follows from the graphical procedure for adding vectors by the polygon
method. Because 冖 ds  0, we conclude that FB  0:
The net magnetic force acting on any closed current loop in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is zero.

EXAMPLE 29.2

Force on a Semicircular Conductor

A wire bent into a semicircle of radius R forms a closed circuit and carries a current I. The wire lies in the xy plane, and
a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is directed along the positive y axis,
as shown in Figure 29.10. Find the magnitude and direction
of the magnetic force acting on the straight portion of the
wire and on the curved portion.

Solution

The force F1 acting on the straight portion has a
magnitude F 1  ILB  2IRB because L  2R and the wire is
oriented perpendicular to B. The direction of F1 is out of the
page because L ⴛ B is along the positive z axis. (That is, L is
to the right, in the direction of the current; thus, according
to the rule of cross products, L ⴛ B is out of the page in Fig.
29.10.)
To ﬁnd the force F2 acting on the curved part, we ﬁrst
write an expression for the force d F2 on the length element
d s shown in Figure 29.10. If  is the angle between B and ds,
then the magnitude of d F2 is

curved wire must also be into the page. Integrating our expression for dF2 over the limits   0 to   (that is, the

Because F2, with a magnitude of 2IRB , is directed into the
page and because F1, with a magnitude of 2IRB , is directed
out of the page, the net force on the closed loop is zero. This
result is consistent with Case 2 described earlier.

To obtain the total force F2 acting on the curved portion,

TORQUE ON A CURRENT LOOP IN A
UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

In the previous section, we showed how a force is exerted on a current-carrying
conductor placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. With this as a starting point, we now show
that a torque is exerted on any current loop placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. The results
of this analysis will be of great value when we discuss motors in Chapter 31.
Consider a rectangular loop carrying a current I in the presence of a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld directed parallel to the plane of the loop, as shown in Figure
29.12a. No magnetic forces act on sides 쩸 and 쩺 because these wires are parallel
to the ﬁeld; hence, L ⴛ B  0 for these sides. However, magnetic forces do act on
sides 쩹 and 쩻 because these sides are oriented perpendicular to the ﬁeld. The
magnitude of these forces is, from Equation 29.3,

(a) Overhead view
of a rectangular current loop in a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld. No forces
are acting on sides 쩸 and 쩺 because these sides are parallel to B.
Forces are acting on sides 쩹 and
쩻, however. (b) Edge view of the
loop sighting down sides 쩹 and 쩻
shows that the forces F2 and F4 exerted on these sides create a torque
that tends to twist the loop clockwise. The purple dot in the left circle represents current in wire 쩹
coming toward you; the purple
cross in the right circle represents
current in wire 쩻 moving away
from you.

The direction of F2 , the force exerted on wire 쩹 is out of the page in the view
shown in Figure 29.12a, and that of F4 , the force exerted on wire 쩻, is into the
page in the same view. If we view the loop from side 쩺 and sight along sides 쩹
and 쩻, we see the view shown in Figure 29.12b, and the two forces F2 and F4 are
directed as shown. Note that the two forces point in opposite directions but are
not directed along the same line of action. If the loop is pivoted so that it can rotate about point O, these two forces produce about O a torque that rotates the
loop clockwise. The magnitude of this torque max is

where the moment arm about O is b/2 for each force. Because the area enclosed
by the loop is A  ab, we can express the maximum torque as

 IAB

(29.8)

Remember that this maximum-torque result is valid only when the magnetic ﬁeld
is parallel to the plane of the loop. The sense of the rotation is clockwise when
viewed from side 쩺, as indicated in Figure 29.12b. If the current direction were re-

915

29.3 Torque on a Current Loop in a Uniform Magnetic Field

versed, the force directions would also reverse, and the rotational tendency would
be counterclockwise.
Now let us suppose that the uniform magnetic ﬁeld makes an angle  90°
with a line perpendicular to the plane of the loop, as shown in Figure 29.13a. For
convenience, we assume that B is perpendicular to sides 쩸 and 쩺. In this case, the
magnetic forces F2 and F4 exerted on sides 쩹 and 쩻 cancel each other and produce no torque because they pass through a common origin. However, the forces
acting on sides 쩸 and 쩺, F1 and F3 , form a couple and hence produce a torque
about any point. Referring to the end view shown in Figure 29.13b, we note that
the moment arm of F1 about the point O is equal to (a/2) sin . Likewise, the moment arm of F3 about O is also (a/2) sin . Because F 1  F 3  IbB, the net torque
about O has the magnitude

loop (  90), as we saw when discussing Figure 29.12, and that it is zero when
the ﬁeld is parallel to the normal to the plane of the loop (  0). As we see in
Figure 29.13, the loop tends to rotate in the direction of decreasing values of 
(that is, such that the area vector A rotates toward the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld).

Quick Quiz 29.4
Describe the forces on the rectangular current loop shown in Figure 29.13 if the magnetic
ﬁeld is directed as shown but increases in magnitude going from left to right.

A convenient expression for the torque exerted on a loop placed in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld B is
 IA ⴛ B

Torque on a current loop

(29.9)

where A, the vector shown in Figure 29.13, is perpendicular to the plane of the
loop and has a magnitude equal to the area of the loop. We determine the direction of A using the right-hand rule described in Figure 29.14. When you curl the
ﬁngers of your right hand in the direction of the current in the loop, your thumb
points in the direction of A. The product I A is deﬁned to be the magnetic dipole
moment ␮ (often simply called the “magnetic moment”) of the loop:
Magnetic dipole moment of a
current loop

␮  IA

(29.10)

The SI unit of magnetic dipole moment is ampere – meter2 (A  m2 ). Using this deﬁnition, we can express the torque exerted on a current-carrying loop in a magnetic ﬁeld B as

␶␮ⴛ B
µ

Figure 29.14

Right-hand rule for
determining the direction of the
vector A. The direction of the magnetic moment ␮ is the same as the
direction of A.

(29.11)

Note that this result is analogous to Equation 26.18, ␶  p ⴛ E, for the torque exerted on an electric dipole in the presence of an electric ﬁeld E, where p is the
electric dipole moment.
Although we obtained the torque for a particular orientation of B with respect
to the loop, the equation ␶  ␮ ⴛ B is valid for any orientation. Furthermore, although we derived the torque expression for a rectangular loop, the result is valid
for a loop of any shape.
If a coil consists of N turns of wire, each carrying the same current and enclosing the same area, the total magnetic dipole moment of the coil is N times the
magnetic dipole moment for one turn. The torque on an N-turn coil is N times
that on a one-turn coil. Thus, we write ␶  N␮loop ⴛ B  ␮coil ⴛ B.
In Section 26.6, we found that the potential energy of an electric dipole in an
electric ﬁeld is given by U   p ⴢ E. This energy depends on the orientation of
the dipole in the electric ﬁeld. Likewise, the potential energy of a magnetic dipole
in a magnetic ﬁeld depends on the orientation of the dipole in the magnetic ﬁeld
and is given by
U  ␮ ⴢ B

(29.12)

From this expression, we see that a magnetic dipole has its lowest energy
U min   B when ␮ points in the same direction as B. The dipole has its highest
energy U max  B when ␮ points in the direction opposite B.

The D’Arsonval Galvanometer

An end view of a D’Arsonval galvanometer (see Section 28.5)
is shown in Figure 29.16. When the turns of wire making up
the coil carry a current, the magnetic ﬁeld created by the
magnet exerts on the coil a torque that turns it (along with its
attached pointer) against the spring. Let us show that the angle of deﬂection of the pointer is directly proportional to the
current in the coil.

Solution

We can use Equation 29.11 to ﬁnd the torque m
the magnetic ﬁeld exerts on the coil. If we assume that the
magnetic ﬁeld through the coil is perpendicular to the normal to the plane of the coil, Equation 29.11 becomes

Thus, the angle of deﬂection of the pointer is directly proportional to the current in the loop. The factor NAB/ tells

(This is a reasonable assumption because the circular cross
section of the magnet ensures radial magnetic ﬁeld lines.)
This magnetic torque is opposed by the torque due to the

law, s   , where  is the torsional spring constant and 
is the angle through which the spring turns. Because the coil
does not have an angular acceleration when the pointer is at

MOTION OF A CHARGED PARTICLE IN A
UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

In Section 29.1 we found that the magnetic force acting on a charged particle
moving in a magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle and that
consequently the work done on the particle by the magnetic force is zero. Let us
now consider the special case of a positively charged particle moving in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld with the initial velocity vector of the particle perpendicular to the
ﬁeld. Let us assume that the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is into the page. Figure 29.17 shows that the particle moves in a circle in a plane perpendicular to the
magnetic ﬁeld.
The particle moves in this way because the magnetic force FB is at right angles
to v and B and has a constant magnitude qvB. As the force deﬂects the particle,
the directions of v and FB change continuously, as Figure 29.17 shows. Because FB
always points toward the center of the circle, it changes only the direction of v
and not its magnitude. As Figure 29.17 illustrates, the rotation is counterclockwise for a positive charge. If q were negative, the rotation would be clockwise. We
can use Equation 6.1 to equate this magnetic force to the radial force required to

When the velocity
of a charged particle is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the
particle moves in a circular path in
a plane perpendicular to B. The
magnetic force FB acting on the
charge is always directed toward
the center of the circle.

(29.15)

These results show that the angular speed of the particle and the period of the circular motion do not depend on the linear speed of the particle or on the radius of
the orbit. The angular speed  is often referred to as the cyclotron frequency because charged particles circulate at this angular speed in the type of accelerator
called a cyclotron, which is discussed in Section 29.5.
If a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld with its velocity at
some arbitrary angle with respect to B, its path is a helix. For example, if the ﬁeld
is directed in the x direction, as shown in Figure 29.18, there is no component of
force in the x direction. As a result, a x  0, and the x component of velocity remains constant. However, the magnetic force qv ⴛ B causes the components vy
and vz to change in time, and the resulting motion is a helix whose axis is parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld. The projection of the path onto the yz plane (viewed along
the x axis) is a circle. (The projections of the path onto the xy and xz planes are sinusoids!) Equations 29.13 to 29.15 still apply provided that v is replaced by

7.5 cm. (Fig. 29.19 shows such a curved beam of electrons.) If
the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the beam, (a) what is
the magnitude of the ﬁeld?

Solution

First we must calculate the speed of the electrons. We can use the fact that the increase in their kinetic
energy must equal the decrease in their potential energy

(b) What is the angular speed of the electrons?

A charged particle
moving in a nonuniform magnetic
ﬁeld (a magnetic bottle) spirals
about the ﬁeld (red path) and oscillates between the end points.
The magnetic force exerted on the
particle near either end of the bottle has a component that causes the
particle to spiral back toward the
center.

Figure 29.19

The bending of an electron beam in a magnetic

ﬁeld.

When charged particles move in a nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld, the motion is
complex. For example, in a magnetic ﬁeld that is strong at the ends and weak in
the middle, such as that shown in Figure 29.20, the particles can oscillate back and
forth between the end points. A charged particle starting at one end spirals along
the ﬁeld lines until it reaches the other end, where it reverses its path and spirals
back. This conﬁguration is known as a magnetic bottle because charged particles can
be trapped within it. The magnetic bottle has been used to conﬁne a plasma, a gas
consisting of ions and electrons. Such a plasma-conﬁnement scheme could fulﬁll a
crucial role in the control of nuclear fusion, a process that could supply us with an
almost endless source of energy. Unfortunately, the magnetic bottle has its problems. If a large number of particles are trapped, collisions between them cause the
particles to eventually leak from the system.
The Van Allen radiation belts consist of charged particles (mostly electrons
and protons) surrounding the Earth in doughnut-shaped regions (Fig. 29.21).
The particles, trapped by the Earth’s nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld, spiral around
the ﬁeld lines from pole to pole, covering the distance in just a few seconds. These
particles originate mainly from the Sun, but some come from stars and other heavenly objects. For this reason, the particles are called cosmic rays. Most cosmic rays
are deﬂected by the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and never reach the atmosphere. However, some of the particles become trapped; it is these particles that make up the
Van Allen belts. When the particles are located over the poles, they sometimes collide with atoms in the atmosphere, causing the atoms to emit visible light. Such
collisions are the origin of the beautiful Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, in
the northern hemisphere and the Aurora Australis in the southern hemisphere.

Figure 29.21 The Van Allen belts are made up of charged particles trapped by the Earth’s
nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld lines are in blue and the particle paths in red.
Auroras are usually conﬁned to the polar regions because it is here that the Van
Allen belts are nearest the Earth’s surface. Occasionally, though, solar activity
causes larger numbers of charged particles to enter the belts and signiﬁcantly distort the normal magnetic ﬁeld lines associated with the Earth. In these situations
an aurora can sometimes be seen at lower latitudes.

This color-enhanced photograph, taken at CERN, the particle physics laboratory outside Geneva,
Switzerland, shows a collection of tracks left by subatomic particles in a bubble chamber. A bubble
chamber is a container ﬁlled with liquid hydrogen that is superheated, that is, momentarily raised
above its normal boiling point by a sudden drop in pressure in the container. Any charged particle
passing through the liquid in this state leaves behind a trail of tiny bubbles as the liquid boils in its
wake. These bubbles are seen as ﬁne tracks, showing the characteristic paths of different types of
particles. The paths are curved because there is an intense applied magnetic ﬁeld. The tightly
wound spiral tracks are due to electrons and positrons.

APPLICATIONS INVOLVING CHARGED PARTICLES
MOVING IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

A charge moving with a velocity v in the presence of both an electric ﬁeld E and a
magnetic ﬁeld B experiences both an electric force qE and a magnetic force
qv ⴛ B. The total force (called the Lorentz force) acting on the charge is

 F  qE

qv ⴛ B

(29.16)

Velocity Selector
In many experiments involving moving charged particles, it is important that the
particles all move with essentially the same velocity. This can be achieved by applying a combination of an electric ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld oriented as shown in
Figure 29.22. A uniform electric ﬁeld is directed vertically downward (in the plane
of the page in Fig. 29.22a), and a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is applied in the direction perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld (into the page in Fig. 29.22a). For q positive, the magnetic force qv ⴛ B is upward and the electric force qE is downward.
When the magnitudes of the two ﬁelds are chosen so that qE  qvB, the particle
moves in a straight horizontal line through the region of the ﬁelds. From the expression qE  qvB, we ﬁnd that

Only those particles having speed v pass undeﬂected through the mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The magnetic force exerted on particles moving
at speeds greater than this is stronger than the electric force, and the particles are
deﬂected upward. Those moving at speeds less than this are deﬂected downward.

The Mass Spectrometer
A mass spectrometer separates ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. In
one version of this device, known as the Bainbridge mass spectrometer, a beam of ions
ﬁrst passes through a velocity selector and then enters a second uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B0 that has the same direction as the magnetic ﬁeld in the selector (Fig.
29.23). Upon entering the second magnetic ﬁeld, the ions move in a semicircle of

q. In this way, the mass ratios can be determined even if q is unknown.
A variation of this technique was used by J. J. Thomson (1856 – 1940) in 1897
to measure the ratio e /me for electrons. Figure 29.24a shows the basic apparatus he

used. Electrons are accelerated from the cathode and pass through two slits. They
then drift into a region of perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The magnitudes of the two ﬁelds are ﬁrst adjusted to produce an undeﬂected beam. When
the magnetic ﬁeld is turned off, the electric ﬁeld produces a measurable beam deﬂection that is recorded on the ﬂuorescent screen. From the size of the deﬂection
and the measured values of E and B, the charge-to-mass ratio can be determined.
The results of this crucial experiment represent the discovery of the electron as a
fundamental particle of nature.

The Cyclotron
A cyclotron can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds. Both electric and
magnetic forces have a key role. The energetic particles produced are used to
bombard atomic nuclei and thereby produce nuclear reactions of interest to researchers. A number of hospitals use cyclotron facilities to produce radioactive
substances for diagnosis and treatment.
A schematic drawing of a cyclotron is shown in Figure 29.26. The charges
move inside two semicircular containers D1 and D2 , referred to as dees. A highfrequency alternating potential difference is applied to the dees, and a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld is directed perpendicular to them. A positive ion released at P near
the center of the magnet in one dee moves in a semicircular path (indicated by
the dashed red line in the drawing) and arrives back at the gap in a time T/2,
where T is the time needed to make one complete trip around the two dees, given
by Equation 29.15. The frequency of the applied potential difference is adjusted so
that the polarity of the dees is reversed in the same time it takes the ion to travel
around one dee. If the applied potential difference is adjusted such that D2 is at a
lower electric potential than D1 by an amount V, the ion accelerates across the
gap to D2 and its kinetic energy increases by an amount qV. It then moves
around D2 in a semicircular path of greater radius (because its speed has increased). After a time T/2, it again arrives at the gap between the dees. By this
time, the polarity across the dees is again reversed, and the ion is given another
“kick” across the gap. The motion continues so that for each half-circle trip
around one dee, the ion gains additional kinetic energy equal to q V. When the
radius of its path is nearly that of the dees, the energetic ion leaves the system
through the exit slit. It is important to note that the operation of the cyclotron is

based on the fact that T is independent of the speed of the ion and of the radius
of the circular path.
We can obtain an expression for the kinetic energy of the ion when it exits the
cyclotron in terms of the radius R of the dees. From Equation 29.13 we know that

When the energy of the ions in a cyclotron exceeds about 20 MeV, relativistic
effects come into play. (Such effects are discussed in Chapter 39.) We observe that
T increases and that the moving ions do not remain in phase with the applied potential difference. Some accelerators overcome this problem by modifying the period of the applied potential difference so that it remains in phase with the moving ions.

THE HALL EFFECT

When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld, a potential difference is generated in a direction perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon, ﬁrst observed by Edwin Hall (1855 – 1938) in 1879,
is known as the Hall effect. It arises from the deﬂection of charge carriers to one
side of the conductor as a result of the magnetic force they experience. The Hall
effect gives information regarding the sign of the charge carriers and their density;
it can also be used to measure the magnitude of magnetic ﬁelds.
The arrangement for observing the Hall effect consists of a ﬂat conductor carrying a current I in the x direction, as shown in Figure 29.27. A uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B is applied in the y direction. If the charge carriers are electrons moving in
the negative x direction with a drift velocity vd , they experience an upward mag-

To observe the Hall effect, a magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a current-carrying conductor. When I is in the
x direction and B in the y direction, both
positive and negative charge carriers are
deﬂected upward in the magnetic ﬁeld.
The Hall voltage is measured between
points a and c.

netic force FB  q vd ⴛ B, are deﬂected upward, and accumulate at the upper
edge of the ﬂat conductor, leaving an excess of positive charge at the lower edge
(Fig. 29.28a). This accumulation of charge at the edges increases until the electric
force resulting from the charge separation balances the magnetic force acting on
the carriers. When this equilibrium condition is reached, the electrons are no
longer deﬂected upward. A sensitive voltmeter or potentiometer connected across
the sample, as shown in Figure 29.28, can measure the potential difference —
known as the Hall voltage VH — generated across the conductor.
If the charge carriers are positive and hence move in the positive x direction,
as shown in Figures 29.27 and 29.28b, they also experience an upward magnetic
force q vd ⴛ B. This produces a buildup of positive charge on the upper edge and
leaves an excess of negative charge on the lower edge. Hence, the sign of the Hall
voltage generated in the sample is opposite the sign of the Hall voltage resulting
from the deﬂection of electrons. The sign of the charge carriers can therefore be
determined from a measurement of the polarity of the Hall voltage.
In deriving an expression for the Hall voltage, we ﬁrst note that the magnetic
force exerted on the carriers has magnitude qvd B. In equilibrium, this force is balanced by the electric force qE H , where E H is the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld
due to the charge separation (sometimes referred to as the Hall ﬁeld). Therefore,

29.6 The Hall Effect

If d is the width of the conductor, the Hall voltage is
V H  E Hd  v d Bd

(29.20)

Thus, the measured Hall voltage gives a value for the drift speed of the charge carriers if d and B are known.
We can obtain the charge carrier density n by measuring the current in the
sample. From Equation 27.4, we can express the drift speed as
vd 

I
nqA

where A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor. Substituting Equation 29.21
into Equation 29.20, we obtain

 H

t
where R H  1/nq is the Hall coefﬁcient. This relationship shows that a properly
calibrated conductor can be used to measure the magnitude of an unknown magnetic ﬁeld.
Because all quantities in Equation 29.23 other than nq can be measured, a
value for the Hall coefﬁcient is readily obtainable. The sign and magnitude of R H
give the sign of the charge carriers and their number density. In most metals, the
charge carriers are electrons, and the charge carrier density determined from
Hall-effect measurements is in good agreement with calculated values for such
metals as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), copper (Cu), and silver (Ag), whose atoms
each give up one electron to act as a current carrier. In this case, n is approximately equal to the number of conducting electrons per unit volume. However,
this classical model is not valid for metals such as iron (Fe), bismuth (Bi), and cadmium (Cd) or for semiconductors. These discrepancies can be explained only by
using a model based on the quantum nature of solids.

Solution If we assume that one electron per atom is available for conduction, we can take the charge carrier density to
be n  8.49  10 28 electrons/m3 (see Example 27.1). Substituting this value and the given data into Equation 29.23 gives

Such an extremely small Hall voltage is expected in good
conductors. (Note that the width of the conductor is not
needed in this calculation.)
In semiconductors, n is much smaller than it is in metals
that contribute one electron per atom to the current; hence,
the Hall voltage is usually greater because it varies as the inverse of n. Currents of the order of 0.1 mA are generally used
for such materials. Consider a piece of silicon that has the
same dimensions as the copper strip in this example and
whose value for n  1.0  10 20 electrons/m3. Taking
B  1.2 T and I  0.10 mA, we ﬁnd that V H  7.5 mV. A

SUMMARY
The magnetic force that acts on a charge q moving with a velocity v in a magnetic
ﬁeld B is
FB  qv ⴛ B

(29.1)

The direction of this magnetic force is perpendicular both to the velocity of the
particle and to the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnitude of this force is
F B  兩 q 兩vB sin 

(29.2)

where  is the smaller angle between v and B. The SI unit of B is the tesla (T),
where 1 T  1 N/A  m.
When a charged particle moves in a magnetic ﬁeld, the work done by the magnetic force on the particle is zero because the displacement is always perpendicular to the direction of the force. The magnetic ﬁeld can alter the direction of the
particle’s velocity vector, but it cannot change its speed.
If a straight conductor of length L carries a current I, the force exerted on
that conductor when it is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B is
FB  I L ⴛ B

(29.3)

where the direction of L is in the direction of the current and 兩 L 兩  L.
If an arbitrarily shaped wire carrying a current I is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld,
the magnetic force exerted on a very small segment ds is
dFB  I ds ⴛ B

(29.4)

To determine the total magnetic force on the wire, one must integrate Equation
29.4, keeping in mind that both B and ds may vary at each point. Integration gives
for the force exerted on a current-carrying conductor of arbitrary shape in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld
FB  I L ⴛ B

(29.7)

where L is a vector directed from one end of the conductor to the opposite end.
Because integration of Equation 29.4 for a closed loop yields a zero result, the net
magnetic force on any closed loop carrying a current in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld
is zero.
The magnetic dipole moment ␮ of a loop carrying a current I is

␮  IA

(29.10)

where the area vector A is perpendicular to the plane of the loop and 兩 A 兩 is equal
to the area of the loop. The SI unit of ␮ is A  m2.
The torque ␶ on a current loop placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B is

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
29.1 Zero. Because the magnetic force exerted by the ﬁeld
on the charge is always perpendicular to the velocity of
the charge, the ﬁeld can never do any work on the
charge: W  FB ⴢ d s  ( FB ⴢ v)dt  0. Work requires a
component of force along the direction of motion.
29.2 Unaffected. The magnetic force exerted by a magnetic
ﬁeld on a charge is proportional to the charge’s velocity
relative to the ﬁeld. If the charge is stationary, as in this
situation, there is no magnetic force.
29.3 (c), (b), (a), (d). As Example 29.2 shows, we need to be
concerned only with the “effective length” of wire perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld or, stated another way,
the length of the “magnetic ﬁeld shadow” cast by the
wire. For (c), 4 m of wire is perpendicular to the ﬁeld.
The short vertical pieces experience no magnetic force
because their currents are parallel to the ﬁeld. When
the wire in (b) is broken into many short vertical and
horizontal segments alternately parallel and perpendicular to the ﬁeld, we ﬁnd a total of 3.5 m of horizontal segments perpendicular to the ﬁeld and therefore experiencing a force. Next comes (a), with 3 m of wire
effectively perpendicular to the ﬁeld. Only 2 m of the
wire in (d) experiences a force. The portion carrying
current from 2 m to 4 m does experience a force di-

rected out of the page, but this force is canceled by an
oppositely directed force acting on the current as it
moves from 4 m to 2 m.
29.4 Because it is in the region of the stronger magnetic
ﬁeld, side 쩺 experiences a greater force than side 쩸:
F 3  F 1 . Therefore, in addition to the torque resulting
from the two forces, a net force is exerted downward on
the loop.
29.5 (c), (b), (a). Because all loops enclose the same area
and carry the same current, the magnitude of ␮ is the
same for all. For (c), ␮ points upward and is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and ␶  ␮ B. This is the maximum torque possible. The next largest cross product of
␮ and B is for (b), in which ␮ points toward the upper
right (as illustrated in Fig. 29.13b). Finally, ␮ for the
loop in (a) points along the direction of B; thus, the
torque is zero.
29.6 The velocity selector ensures that all three types of particles have the same speed. We cannot determine individual masses or charges, but we can rank the particles by
m/q ratio. Equation 29.18 indicates that those particles
traveling through the circle of greatest radius have the
greatest m/q ratio. Thus, the m /q ranking, from greatest
to least value, is c, b, a.

I

n the preceding chapter, we discussed the magnetic force exerted on a charged
particle moving in a magnetic ﬁeld. To complete the description of the magnetic interaction, this chapter deals with the origin of the magnetic ﬁeld — moving charges. We begin by showing how to use the law of Biot and Savart to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld produced at some point in space by a small current
element. Using this formalism and the principle of superposition, we then calculate the total magnetic ﬁeld due to various current distributions. Next, we show
how to determine the force between two current-carrying conductors, which leads
to the deﬁnition of the ampere. We also introduce Ampère’s law, which is useful in
calculating the magnetic ﬁeld of a highly symmetric conﬁguration carrying a
steady current.
This chapter is also concerned with the complex processes that occur in magnetic materials. All magnetic effects in matter can be explained on the basis of
atomic magnetic moments, which arise both from the orbital motion of the electrons and from an intrinsic property of the electrons known as spin.

30.1

THE BIOT – SAVART LAW

Shortly after Oersted’s discovery in 1819 that a compass needle is deﬂected by a
current-carrying conductor, Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774 – 1862) and Félix Savart
(1791 – 1841) performed quantitative experiments on the force exerted by an electric current on a nearby magnet. From their experimental results, Biot and Savart
arrived at a mathematical expression that gives the magnetic ﬁeld at some point in
space in terms of the current that produces the ﬁeld. That expression is based on
the following experimental observations for the magnetic ﬁeld d B at a point P associated with a length element ds of a wire carrying a steady current I (Fig. 30.1):
Properties of the magnetic ﬁeld
created by an electric current

• The vector d B is perpendicular both to ds (which points in the direction of the

current) and to the unit vector r̂ directed from ds to P.
• The magnitude of d B is inversely proportional to r 2, where r is the distance

from ds to P.
• The magnitude of d B is proportional to the current and to the magnitude ds of

the length element ds.

• The magnitude of d B is proportional to sin ␪, where ␪ is the angle between the

vectors ds and r̂.

It is important to note that the ﬁeld d B in Equation 30.1 is the ﬁeld created by
the current in only a small length element ds of the conductor. To ﬁnd the total
magnetic ﬁeld B created at some point by a current of ﬁnite size, we must sum up
contributions from all current elements Ids that make up the current. That is, we
must evaluate B by integrating Equation 30.1:

(30.3)

where the integral is taken over the entire current distribution. This expression
must be handled with special care because the integrand is a cross product and
therefore a vector quantity. We shall see one case of such an integration in Example 30.1.
Although we developed the Biot – Savart law for a current-carrying wire, it is
also valid for a current consisting of charges ﬂowing through space, such as the
electron beam in a television set. In that case, ds represents the length of a small
segment of space in which the charges ﬂow.
Interesting similarities exist between the Biot – Savart law for magnetism
and Coulomb’s law for electrostatics. The current element produces a magnetic
ﬁeld, whereas a point charge produces an electric ﬁeld. Furthermore, the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld varies as the inverse square of the distance from the
current element, as does the electric ﬁeld due to a point charge. However, the
directions of the two ﬁelds are quite different. The electric ﬁeld created by a
point charge is radial, but the magnetic ﬁeld created by a current element is perpendicular to both the length element ds and the unit vector r̂ , as described by
the cross product in Equation 30.1. Hence, if the conductor lies in the plane of
the page, as shown in Figure 30.1, d B points out of the page at P and into the page
at P ⬘.
Another difference between electric and magnetic ﬁelds is related to the
source of the ﬁeld. An electric ﬁeld is established by an isolated electric charge.
The Biot – Savart law gives the magnetic ﬁeld of an isolated current element at
some point, but such an isolated current element cannot exist the way an isolated
electric charge can. A current element must be part of an extended current distribution because we must have a complete circuit in order for charges to ﬂow. Thus,
the Biot – Savart law is only the ﬁrst step in a calculation of a magnetic ﬁeld; it must
be followed by an integration over the current distribution.
In the examples that follow, it is important to recognize that the magnetic
ﬁeld determined in these calculations is the ﬁeld created by a current-carrying conductor. This ﬁeld is not to be confused with any additional ﬁelds that may
be present outside the conductor due to other sources, such as a bar magnet
placed nearby.

EXAMPLE 30.1

Sources of the Magnetic Field

Magnetic Field Surrounding a Thin, Straight Conductor

Consider a thin, straight wire carrying a constant current I
and placed along the x axis as shown in Figure 30.2. Determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at
point P due to this current.

Solution

From the Biot – Savart law, we expect that the
magnitude of the ﬁeld is proportional to the current in the
wire and decreases as the distance a from the wire to point P
increases. We start by considering a length element ds located a distance r from P. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
at point P due to the current in this element is out of the
page because ds ⴛ r̂ is out of the page. In fact, since all of
the current elements I ds lie in the plane of the page, they all
produce a magnetic ﬁeld directed out of the page at point P.
Thus, we have the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at point P,
and we need only ﬁnd the magnitude.
Taking the origin at O and letting point P be along the
positive y axis, with k being a unit vector pointing out of the
page, we see that
d s ⴛ r̂ ⫽ k 兩 d s ⴛ r̂ 兩 ⫽ k(dx sin ␪)

an expression in which the only variable is ␪. We can now obtain the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at point P by integrating Equation (4) over all elements, subtending angles
ranging from ␪1 to ␪2 as deﬁned in Figure 30.2b:

Because all current elements produce a magnetic ﬁeld in the

the ﬁeld due to one current element, which is
(1)

␪2

We can use this result to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld of any
straight current-carrying wire if we know the geometry and
hence the angles ␪1 and ␪2 . Consider the special case of an
inﬁnitely long, straight wire. If we let the wire in Figure 30.2b
become inﬁnitely long, we see that ␪1 ⫽ 0 and ␪2 ⫽ ␲ for
length elements ranging between positions x ⫽ ⫺ ⬁ and x ⫽

where, from Chapter 3, 兩d s ⴛ r̂ 兩 represents the magnitude of
ds ⴛ r̂. Because r̂ is a unit vector, the unit of the cross product is simply the unit of ds, which is length. Substitution into

30.1 The Biot – Savart Law
the magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to the current and decreases with increasing distance from the wire, as we expected. Notice that Equation 30.5 has the same mathematical
form as the expression for the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld
due to a long charged wire (see Eq. 24.7).

Exercise

Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld
4.0 cm from an inﬁnitely long, straight wire carrying a current of 5.0 A.

Answer

2.5 ⫻ 10⫺5 T.

The result of Example 30.1 is important because a current in the form of a
long, straight wire occurs often. Figure 30.3 is a three-dimensional view of the
magnetic ﬁeld surrounding a long, straight current-carrying wire. Because of the
symmetry of the wire, the magnetic ﬁeld lines are circles concentric with the wire
and lie in planes perpendicular to the wire. The magnitude of B is constant on any
circle of radius a and is given by Equation 30.5. A convenient rule for determining
the direction of B is to grasp the wire with the right hand, positioning the thumb
along the direction of the current. The four ﬁngers wrap in the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld.

Magnetic Field Due to a Curved Wire Segment

Calculate the magnetic ﬁeld at point O for the current-carrying wire segment shown in Figure 30.4. The wire consists of
two straight portions and a circular arc of radius R, which
subtends an angle ␪. The arrowheads on the wire indicate the
direction of the current.

Solution The magnetic ﬁeld at O due to the current in
the straight segments AA⬘ and CC⬘ is zero because ds is parallel to r̂ along these paths; this means that ds ⴛ r̂ ⫽ 0. Each
length element ds along path AC is at the same distance R
from O, and the current in each contributes a ﬁeld element
dB directed into the page at O. Furthermore, at every point
on AC, ds is perpendicular to r̂; hence, 兩 d s ⴛ r̂ 兩 ⫽ ds. Using
this information and Equation 30.1, we can ﬁnd the magnitude of the ﬁeld at O due to the current in an element of

The direction of d B is perpendicular to the plane formed by

into a component dBx along the x axis and a component dBy
perpendicular to the x axis. When the components dBy are
summed over all elements around the loop, the resultant
component is zero. That is, by symmetry the current in any
element on one side of the loop sets up a perpendicular component of d B that cancels the perpendicular component set
up by the current through the element diametrically opposite

THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN TWO
PARALLEL CONDUCTORS

In Chapter 29 we described the magnetic force that acts on a current-carrying conductor placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld. Because a current in a conductor sets
up its own magnetic ﬁeld, it is easy to understand that two current-carrying conductors exert magnetic forces on each other. As we shall see, such forces can be
used as the basis for deﬁning the ampere and the coulomb.
Consider two long, straight, parallel wires separated by a distance a and carrying currents I 1 and I 2 in the same direction, as illustrated in Figure 30.7. We can
determine the force exerted on one wire due to the magnetic ﬁeld set up by the
other wire. Wire 2, which carries a current I2 , creates a magnetic ﬁeld B2 at the location of wire 1. The direction of B2 is perpendicular to wire 1, as shown in Figure
30.7. According to Equation 29.3, the magnetic force on a length ᐍ of wire 1 is
F1 ⫽ I 1ᐍ ⴛ B2. Because ᐍ is perpendicular to B2 in this situation, the magnitude
of F1 is F 1 ⫽ I 1 ᐉB 2 . Because the magnitude of B2 is given by Equation 30.5, we see

The direction of F1 is toward wire 2 because ᐍ ⴛ B2 is in that direction. If the ﬁeld
set up at wire 2 by wire 1 is calculated, the force F2 acting on wire 2 is found to be
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to F1 . This is what we expect be-

cause Newton’s third law must be obeyed.1 When the currents are in opposite directions (that is, when one of the currents is reversed in Fig. 30.7), the forces are
reversed and the wires repel each other. Hence, we ﬁnd that parallel conductors
carrying currents in the same direction attract each other, and parallel conductors carrying currents in opposite directions repel each other.
Because the magnitudes of the forces are the same on both wires, we denote
the magnitude of the magnetic force between the wires as simply FB . We can
rewrite this magnitude in terms of the force per unit length:

The force between two parallel wires is used to deﬁne the ampere as follows:
When the magnitude of the force per unit length between two long, parallel

the current in each wire is deﬁned to be 1 A.

The value 2 ⫻ 10⫺7 N/m is obtained from Equation 30.12 with I 1 ⫽ I 2 ⫽ 1 A and
a ⫽ 1 m. Because this deﬁnition is based on a force, a mechanical measurement
can be used to standardize the ampere. For instance, the National Institute of

current measurements. The results are then used to standardize other, more conventional instruments, such as ammeters.
The SI unit of charge, the coulomb, is deﬁned in terms of the ampere:
When a conductor carries a steady current of 1 A, the quantity of charge that
ﬂows through a cross-section of the conductor in 1 s is 1 C.

Deﬁnition of the coulomb

In deriving Equations 30.11 and 30.12, we assumed that both wires are long

Although the total force exerted on wire 1 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the total force exerted on wire 2, Newton’s third law does not apply when one considers two small elements

AMP ÈRE’S LAW

Oersted’s 1819 discovery about deﬂected compass needles demonstrates that a
current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 30.8a shows how this
effect can be demonstrated in the classroom. Several compass needles are placed
in a horizontal plane near a long vertical wire. When no current is present in the
wire, all the needles point in the same direction (that of the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld), as expected. When the wire carries a strong, steady current, the needles all
deﬂect in a direction tangent to the circle, as shown in Figure 30.8b. These observations demonstrate that the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the current in the wire is consistent with the right-hand rule described in Figure 30.3.
When the current is reversed, the needles in Figure 30.8b also reverse.
Because the compass needles point in the direction of B, we conclude that the
lines of B form circles around the wire, as discussed in the preceding section. By
symmetry, the magnitude of B is the same everywhere on a circular path centered
on the wire and lying in a plane perpendicular to the wire. By varying the current
and distance a from the wire, we ﬁnd that B is proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire, as Equation 30.5 describes.
Now let us evaluate the product B ⴢ ds for a small length element ds on the circular path deﬁned by the compass needles, and sum the products for all elements
over the closed circular path. Along this path, the vectors ds and B are parallel at
each point (see Fig. 30.8b), so B ⴢ ds ⫽ B ds. Furthermore, the magnitude of B is
constant on this circle and is given by Equation 30.5. Therefore, the sum of the
products B ds over the closed path, which is equivalent to the line integral of
B ⴢ ds, is

Andre-Marie Ampère
(1775– 1836) Ampère, a Frenchman,
is credited with the discovery of electromagnetism — the relationship between electric currents and magnetic
ﬁelds. Ampère’s genius, particularly in
mathematics, became evident by the
time he was 12 years old; his personal
life, however, was ﬁlled with tragedy.
His father, a wealthy city ofﬁcial, was
guillotined during the French Revolution, and his wife died young, in 1803.
Ampère died at the age of 61 of pneumonia. His judgment of his life is clear
from the epitaph he chose for his
gravestone: Tandem Felix (Happy at
Last). (AIP Emilio Segre Visual Archive)

EXAMPLE 30.4

The Magnetic Field Created by a Long Current-Carrying Wire

A long, straight wire of radius R carries a steady current I 0
that is uniformly distributed through the cross-section of the
wire (Fig. 30.11). Calculate the magnetic ﬁeld a distance r
from the center of the wire in the regions r ⱖ R and r ⬍ R.

Solution For the r ⱖ R case, we should get the same result
we obtained in Example 30.1, in which we applied the
Biot – Savart law to the same situation. Let us choose for our
path of integration circle 1 in Figure 30.11. From symmetry,
B must be constant in magnitude and parallel to ds at every
point on this circle. Because the total current passing
through the plane of the circle is I0 , Ampère’s law gives

which is identical in form to Equation 30.5. Note how much
easier it is to use Ampère’s law than to use the Biot – Savart
law. This is often the case in highly symmetric situations.
Now consider the interior of the wire, where r ⬍ R. Here
the current I passing through the plane of circle 2 is less than
the total current I 0 . Because the current is uniform over the
cross-section of the wire, the fraction of the current enclosed

This result is similar in form to the expression for the electric
ﬁeld inside a uniformly charged sphere (see Example 24.5).
The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld versus r for this conﬁguration is plotted in Figure 30.12. Note that inside the wire,
B : 0 as r : 0. Note also that Equations 30.14 and 30.15 give
the same value of the magnetic ﬁeld at r ⫽ R, demonstrating
that the magnetic ﬁeld is continuous at the surface of the
wire.

wire shown in Figure 30.11. The ﬁeld is proportional to r inside the

The Magnetic Field Created by a Toroid

A device called a toroid (Fig. 30.13) is often used to create an
almost uniform magnetic ﬁeld in some enclosed area. The
device consists of a conducting wire wrapped around a ring
(a torus) made of a nonconducting material. For a toroid hav2

product of the current density J ⫽ I 0/␲R 2 and the area ␲ r 2 of this circle.

varies as 1/r. The ﬁeld outside the toroid is zero. The dimension a is
the cross-sectional radius of the torus.

EXAMPLE 30.6

This result shows that B varies as 1/r and hence is nonuniform in the region occupied by the torus. However, if r is very
large compared with the cross-sectional radius of the torus,
then the ﬁeld is approximately uniform inside the torus.
For an ideal toroid, in which the turns are closely spaced,
the external magnetic ﬁeld is zero. This can be seen by noting that the net current passing through any circular path lying outside the toroid (including the region of the “hole in
the doughnut”) is zero. Therefore, from Ampère’s law we
ﬁnd that B ⫽ 0 in the regions exterior to the torus.

Magnetic Field Created by an Inﬁnite Current Sheet

So far we have imagined currents through wires of small
cross-section. Let us now consider an example in which a current exists in an extended object. A thin, inﬁnitely large sheet
lying in the yz plane carries a current of linear current density
Js . The current is in the y direction, and Js represents the current per unit length measured along the z axis. Find the magnetic ﬁeld near the sheet.

Solution This situation brings to mind similar calculations
involving Gauss’s law (see Example 24.8). You may recall that
z

the electric ﬁeld due to an inﬁnite sheet of charge does not
depend on distance from the sheet. Thus, we might expect a
similar result here for the magnetic ﬁeld.
To evaluate the line integral in Ampère’s law, let us take a
rectangular path through the sheet, as shown in Figure 30.14.
The rectangle has dimensions ᐉ and w, with the sides of
length ᐉ parallel to the sheet surface. The net current passing
through the plane of the rectangle is Js ᐉ. We apply Ampère’s
law over the rectangle and note that the two sides of length w
do not contribute to the line integral because the component
of B along the direction of these paths is zero. By symmetry,
we can argue that the magnetic ﬁeld is constant over the
sides of length ᐉ because every point on the inﬁnitely large
sheet is equivalent, and hence the ﬁeld should not vary from
point to point. The only choices of ﬁeld direction that are
reasonable for the symmetry are perpendicular or parallel to
the sheet, and a perpendicular ﬁeld would pass through the
current, which is inconsistent with the Biot – Savart law. Assuming a ﬁeld that is constant in magnitude and parallel to
the plane of the sheet, we obtain

from the current sheet, as we suspected.

THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A SOLENOID

A solenoid is a long wire wound in the form of a helix. With this conﬁguration, a
reasonably uniform magnetic ﬁeld can be produced in the space surrounded by
the turns of wire — which we shall call the interior of the solenoid — when the solenoid carries a current. When the turns are closely spaced, each can be approximated as a circular loop, and the net magnetic ﬁeld is the vector sum of the ﬁelds
resulting from all the turns.
Figure 30.16 shows the magnetic ﬁeld lines surrounding a loosely wound solenoid. Note that the ﬁeld lines in the interior are nearly parallel to one another, are
uniformly distributed, and are close together, indicating that the ﬁeld in this space
is uniform and strong. The ﬁeld lines between current elements on two adjacent
turns tend to cancel each other because the ﬁeld vectors from the two elements
are in opposite directions. The ﬁeld at exterior points such as P is weak because
the ﬁeld due to current elements on the right-hand portion of a turn tends to cancel the ﬁeld due to current elements on the left-hand portion.

A technician studies the scan of a
patient’s head. The scan was obtained using a medical diagnostic
technique known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This instrument makes use of strong magnetic
ﬁelds produced by superconducting solenoids.

If the turns are closely spaced and the solenoid is of ﬁnite length, the magnetic ﬁeld lines are as shown in Figure 30.17a. This ﬁeld line distribution is similar
to that surrounding a bar magnet (see Fig. 30.17b). Hence, one end of the solenoid behaves like the north pole of a magnet, and the opposite end behaves like
the south pole. As the length of the solenoid increases, the interior ﬁeld becomes
more uniform and the exterior ﬁeld becomes weaker. An ideal solenoid is approached when the turns are closely spaced and the length is much greater than
the radius of the turns. In this case, the external ﬁeld is zero, and the interior ﬁeld
is uniform over a great volume.

We can use Ampère’s law to obtain an expression for the interior magnetic
ﬁeld in an ideal solenoid. Figure 30.18 shows a longitudinal cross-section of part of
such a solenoid carrying a current I. Because the solenoid is ideal, B in the interior space is uniform and parallel to the axis, and B in the exterior space is zero.
Consider the rectangular path of length ᐉ and width w shown in Figure 30.18. We
can apply Ampère’s law to this path by evaluating the integral of B ⴢ ds over each
side of the rectangle. The contribution along side 3 is zero because B ⫽ 0 in this
region. The contributions from sides 2 and 4 are both zero because B is perpendicular to ds along these paths. Side 1 gives a contribution Bᐉ to the integral because along this path B is uniform and parallel to ds. The integral over the closed
rectangular path is therefore

The right side of Ampère’s law involves the total current passing through the
area bounded by the path of integration. In this case, the total current through
the rectangular path equals the current through each turn multiplied by the number of turns. If N is the number of turns in the length ᐉ, the total current through
the rectangle is NI. Therefore, Ampère’s law applied to this path gives

We also could obtain this result by reconsidering the magnetic ﬁeld of a toroid
(see Example 30.5). If the radius r of the torus in Figure 30.13 containing N turns
is much greater than the toroid’s cross-sectional radius a, a short section of the
toroid approximates a solenoid for which n ⫽ N/2␲r. In this limit, Equation 30.16
agrees with Equation 30.17.
Equation 30.17 is valid only for points near the center (that is, far from the
ends) of a very long solenoid. As you might expect, the ﬁeld near each end is
smaller than the value given by Equation 30.17. At the very end of a long solenoid,
the magnitude of the ﬁeld is one-half the magnitude at the center.

GAUSS’S LAW IN MAGNETISM

In Chapter 24 we found that the electric ﬂux through a closed surface surrounding a net charge is proportional to that charge (Gauss’s law). In other words, the
number of electric ﬁeld lines leaving the surface depends only on the net charge
within it. This property is based on the fact that electric ﬁeld lines originate and
terminate on electric charges.
The situation is quite different for magnetic ﬁelds, which are continuous and
form closed loops. In other words, magnetic ﬁeld lines do not begin or end at any
point — as illustrated by the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the bar magnet in Figure 30.22.
Note that for any closed surface, such as the one outlined by the dashed red line
in Figure 30.22, the number of lines entering the surface equals the number leaving the surface; thus, the net magnetic ﬂux is zero. In contrast, for a closed surface
surrounding one charge of an electric dipole (Fig. 30.23), the net electric ﬂux is
not zero.
Gauss’s law in magnetism states that
the net magnetic ﬂux through any closed surface is always zero:

Ampère’s law that is resolved

only if one postulates a displacement current through S2 .

DISPLACEMENT CURRENT AND THE GENERAL
FORM OF AMP ÈRE’S LAW

We have seen that charges in motion produce magnetic ﬁelds. When a currentcarrying conductor has high symmetry, we can use Ampère’s law to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld it creates. In Equation 30.13, 冖 B ⴢ ds ⫽ ␮ 0 I, the line integral is over any
closed path through which the conduction current passes, and the conduction current is deﬁned by the expression I ⫽ dq/dt. (In this section we use the term conduction current to refer to the current carried by the wire, to distinguish it from a new type
of current that we shall introduce shortly.) We now show that Ampère’s law in this
form is valid only if any electric ﬁelds present are constant in time. Maxwell
recognized this limitation and modiﬁed Ampère’s law to include time-varying electric
ﬁelds.
We can understand the problem by considering a capacitor that is being
charged as illustrated in Figure 30.24. When a conduction current is present, the
charge on the positive plate changes but no conduction current passes across the gap between the plates. Now consider the two surfaces S 1 and S 2 in Figure 30.24, bounded
by the same path P. Ampère’s law states that 冖 B ⴢ ds around this path must equal
␮0 I, where I is the total current through any surface bounded by the path P.
When the path P is considered as bounding S1 , 冖 B ⴢ ds is ␮0 I because the conduction current passes through S1 . When the path is considered as bounding S 2 ,
however, 冖 B ⴢ ds ⫽ 0 because no conduction current passes through S 2 . Thus, we arrive at a contradictory situation that arises from the discontinuity of the current! Maxwell solved this problem by postulating an additional term on the right side of Equation 30.13, which includes a factor called the displacement current Id , deﬁned as3
I d ⬅ ⑀0

Displacement current

d⌽E

where ⑀0 is the permittivity of free space (see Section 23.3) and ⌽E ⫽ 冕 E ⴢ dA is the
electric ﬂux (see Eq. 24.3).
As the capacitor is being charged (or discharged), the changing electric ﬁeld
between the plates may be considered equivalent to a current that acts as a continuation of the conduction current in the wire. When the expression for the displacement current given by Equation 30.21 is added to the conduction current on
the right side of Ampère’s law, the difﬁculty represented in Figure 30.24 is resolved. No matter which surface bounded by the path P is chosen, either conduction current or displacement current passes through it. With this new term Id ,
we can express the general form of Ampère’s law (sometimes called the
Ampère – Maxwell law) as4

Displacement in this context does not have the meaning it does in Chapter 2. Despite the inaccurate
implications, the word is historically entrenched in the language of physics, so we continue to use it.

Strictly speaking, this expression is valid only in a vacuum. If a magnetic material is present, one must
change ␮0 and ⑀0 on the right-hand side of Equation 30.22 to the permeability ␮m and permittivity ⑀
characteristic of the material. Alternatively, one may include a magnetizing current Im on the righthand
side of Equation 30.22 to make Ampère’s law fully general. On a microscopic scale, Im is as real as I.

We can understand the meaning of this expression by referring to Figure 30.25.
The electric ﬂux through surface S 2 is ⌽E ⫽ 冕 E ⴢ dA ⫽ EA, where A is the area of
the capacitor plates and E is the magnitude of the uniform electric ﬁeld between

Section 26.2). Therefore, the electric ﬂux through S 2 is simply

(30.23)

That is, the displacement current through S 2 is precisely equal to the conduction
current I through S1 !
By considering surface S 2 , we can identify the displacement current as the
source of the magnetic ﬁeld on the surface boundary. The displacement current
has its physical origin in the time-varying electric ﬁeld. The central point of this
formalism, then, is that
magnetic ﬁelds are produced both by conduction currents and by time-varying
electric ﬁelds.
This result was a remarkable example of theoretical work by Maxwell, and it contributed to major advances in the understanding of electromagnetism.

MAGNETISM IN MATTER

The magnetic ﬁeld produced by a current in a coil of wire gives us a hint as to
what causes certain materials to exhibit strong magnetic properties. Earlier we
found that a coil like the one shown in Figure 30.17 has a north pole and a south
pole. In general, any current loop has a magnetic ﬁeld and thus has a magnetic dipole moment, including the atomic-level current loops described in some models
of the atom. Thus, the magnetic moments in a magnetized substance may be described as arising from these atomic-level current loops. For the Bohr model of the
atom, these current loops are associated with the movement of electrons around
the nucleus in circular orbits. In addition, a magnetic moment is intrinsic to electrons, protons, neutrons, and other particles; it arises from a property called spin.

Figure 30.26

An electron moving in a circular orbit of radius r
has an angular momentum L in
one direction and a magnetic moment ␮ in the opposite direction.

It is instructive to begin our discussion with a classical model of the atom in which
electrons move in circular orbits around the much more massive nucleus. In this
model, an orbiting electron constitutes a tiny current loop (because it is a moving
charge), and the magnetic moment of the electron is associated with this orbital motion. Although this model has many deﬁciencies, its predictions are in good agreement with the correct theory, which is expressed in terms of quantum physics.
Consider an electron moving with constant speed v in a circular orbit of radius
r about the nucleus, as shown in Figure 30.26. Because the electron travels a distance of 2␲ r (the circumference of the circle) in a time T, its orbital speed is
v ⫽ 2␲r /T. The current I associated with this orbiting electron is its charge e divided by T. Using T ⫽ 2␲/␻ and ␻ ⫽ v/r, we have

This result demonstrates that the magnetic moment of the electron is proportional to its orbital angular momentum. Note that because the electron is negatively charged, the vectors ␮ and L point in opposite directions. Both vectors are
perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, as indicated in Figure 30.26.
A fundamental outcome of quantum physics is that orbital angular momentum is quantized and is equal to multiples of ប ⫽ h/2␲ ⫽ 1.05 ⫻ 10 ⫺34 J ⭈s, where

30.8 Magnetism in Matter

Because all substances contain electrons, you may wonder why not all substances are magnetic. The main reason is that in most substances, the magnetic
moment of one electron in an atom is canceled by that of another electron orbiting in the opposite direction. The net result is that, for most materials, the magnetic effect produced by the orbital motion of the electrons is either zero or
very small.
In addition to its orbital magnetic moment, an electron has an intrinsic property called spin that also contributes to its magnetic moment. In this regard, the
electron can be viewed as spinning about its axis while it orbits the nucleus, as
shown in Figure 30.27. (Warning: This classical description should not be taken literally because spin arises from relativistic dynamics that must be incorporated into
a quantum-mechanical analysis.) The magnitude of the angular momentum S associated with spin is of the same order of magnitude as the angular momentum L
due to the orbital motion. The magnitude of the spin angular momentum predicted by quantum theory is

(30.28)

Thus, atomic magnetic moments can be expressed as multiples of the Bohr magneton. (Note that 1 J/T ⫽ 1 A ⭈ m2.)
In atoms containing many electrons, the electrons usually pair up with their
spins opposite each other; thus, the spin magnetic moments cancel. However,
atoms containing an odd number of electrons must have at least one unpaired
electron and therefore some spin magnetic moment. The total magnetic moment
of an atom is the vector sum of the orbital and spin magnetic moments, and a few
examples are given in Table 30.1. Note that helium and neon have zero moments
because their individual spin and orbital moments cancel.
The nucleus of an atom also has a magnetic moment associated with its constituent protons and neutrons. However, the magnetic moment of a proton or
neutron is much smaller than that of an electron and can usually be neglected. We
can understand this by inspecting Equation 30.28 and replacing the mass of the
electron with the mass of a proton or a neutron. Because the masses of the proton
and neutron are much greater than that of the electron, their magnetic moments
are on the order of 103 times smaller than that of the electron.

Magnetization Vector and Magnetic Field Strength
The magnetic state of a substance is described by a quantity called the magnetization vector M. The magnitude of this vector is deﬁned as the magnetic moment per unit volume of the substance. As you might expect, the total magnetic
ﬁeld B at a point within a substance depends on both the applied (external) ﬁeld
B0 and the magnetization of the substance.
To understand the problems involved in measuring the total magnetic ﬁeld B
in such situations, consider this: Scientists use small probes that utilize the Hall ef-

fect (see Section 29.6) to measure magnetic ﬁelds. What would such a probe read
if it were positioned inside the solenoid mentioned in the QuickLab on page 951
when you inserted the compass? Because the compass is a magnetic material, the
probe would measure a total magnetic ﬁeld B that is the sum of the solenoid (external) ﬁeld B0 and the (magnetization) ﬁeld Bm due to the compass. This tells us
that we need a way to distinguish between magnetic ﬁelds originating from currents and those originating from magnetic materials. Consider a region in which a
magnetic ﬁeld B0 is produced by a current-carrying conductor. If we now ﬁll that
region with a magnetic substance, the total magnetic ﬁeld B in the region is
B ⫽ B0 ⫹ Bm , where Bm is the ﬁeld produced by the magnetic substance. We can
express this contribution in terms of the magnetization vector of the substance as
Bm ⫽ ␮ 0 M; hence, the total magnetic ﬁeld in the region becomes
B ⫽ B0 ⫹ ␮ 0 M
Magnetic ﬁeld strength H

(30.29)

When analyzing magnetic ﬁelds that arise from magnetization, it is convenient
to introduce a ﬁeld quantity, called the magnetic ﬁeld strength H within the
substance. The magnetic ﬁeld strength represents the effect of the conduction
currents in wires on a substance. To emphasize the distinction between the ﬁeld
strength H and the ﬁeld B, the latter is often called the magnetic ﬂux density or the
magnetic induction. The magnetic ﬁeld strength is a vector deﬁned by the relationship H ⫽ B0 /␮ 0 ⫽ (B/␮ 0 ) ⫺ M. Thus, Equation 30.29 can be written
B ⫽ ␮ 0(H ⫹ M)

(30.30)

The quantities H and M have the same units. In SI units, because M is magnetic
moment per unit volume, the units are (ampere)(meter)2/(meter)3, or amperes
per meter.
To better understand these expressions, consider the torus region of a toroid
that carries a current I. If this region is a vacuum, M ⫽ 0 (because no magnetic
material is present), the total magnetic ﬁeld is that arising from the current alone,
and B ⫽ B0 ⫽ ␮ 0 H. Because B 0 ⫽ ␮ 0nI in the torus region, where n is the number of turns per unit length of the toroid, H ⫽ B 0 /␮ 0 ⫽ ␮ 0nI/␮ 0 , or
H ⫽ nI

(30.31)

In this case, the magnetic ﬁeld B in the torus region is due only to the current in
the windings of the toroid.
If the torus is now made of some substance and the current I is kept constant, H
in the torus region remains unchanged (because it depends on the current only)
and has magnitude nI. The total ﬁeld B, however, is different from that when the
torus region was a vacuum. From Equation 30.30, we see that part of B arises from
the term ␮0 H associated with the current in the toroid, and part arises from the
term ␮0 M due to the magnetization of the substance of which the torus is made.

Classiﬁcation of Magnetic Substances

Oxygen, a paramagnetic substance,
is attracted to a magnetic ﬁeld. The
liquid oxygen in this photograph is
suspended between the poles of
the magnet.

Substances can be classiﬁed as belonging to one of three categories, depending on
their magnetic properties. Paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are those
made of atoms that have permanent magnetic moments. Diamagnetic materials
are those made of atoms that do not have permanent magnetic moments.
For paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances, the magnetization vector M is
proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld strength H. For these substances placed in an
external magnetic ﬁeld, we can write
M ⫽ ␹H

where ␹ (Greek letter chi) is a dimensionless factor called the magnetic susceptibility. For paramagnetic substances, ␹ is positive and M is in the same direction
as H. For diamagnetic substances, ␹ is negative and M is opposite H. (It is important to note that this linear relationship between M and H does not apply to
ferromagnetic substances.) The susceptibilities of some substances are given in
Table 30.2.
Substituting Equation 30.32 for M into Equation 30.30 gives

is related to the susceptibility by

␮ m ⫽ ␮ 0(1 ⫹ ␹)

(30.34)

compares with ␮0 (the permeability of free space), as follows:
Paramagnetic

␮m ⬎ ␮0

Diamagnetic

␮m ⬍ ␮0

Because ␹ is very small for paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances (see Table
30.2), ␮m is nearly equal to ␮0 for these substances. For ferromagnetic substances,
however, ␮m is typically several thousand times greater than ␮0 (meaning that ␹ is
very great for ferromagnetic substances).
Although Equation 30.33 provides a simple relationship between B and H, we
must interpret it with care when dealing with ferromagnetic substances. As mentioned earlier, M is not a linear function of H for ferromagnetic substances. This is
because the value of ␮m is not only a characteristic of the ferromagnetic substance
but also depends on the previous state of the substance and on the process it underwent as it moved from its previous state to its present one. We shall investigate
this more deeply after the following example.

(a) Random orientation of atomic magnetic moments
in an unmagnetized substance.
(b) When an external ﬁeld B0 is
applied, the atomic magnetic moments tend to align with the ﬁeld,
giving the sample a net magnetization vector M.

A small number of crystalline substances in which the atoms have permanent magnetic moments exhibit strong magnetic effects called ferromagnetism. Some examples of ferromagnetic substances are iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and dysprosium. These substances contain atomic magnetic moments that tend to align
parallel to each other even in a weak external magnetic ﬁeld. Once the moments
are aligned, the substance remains magnetized after the external ﬁeld is removed.
This permanent alignment is due to a strong coupling between neighboring moments, a coupling that can be understood only in quantum-mechanical terms.
All ferromagnetic materials are made up of microscopic regions called domains, regions within which all magnetic moments are aligned. These domains
have volumes of about 10⫺12 to 10⫺8 m3 and contain 1017 to 1021 atoms. The
boundaries between the various domains having different orientations are called
domain walls. In an unmagnetized sample, the domains are randomly oriented
so that the net magnetic moment is zero, as shown in Figure 30.28a. When the
sample is placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic moments of the
atoms tend to align with the ﬁeld, which results in a magnetized sample, as in Figure 30.28b. Observations show that domains initially oriented along the external
ﬁeld grow larger at the expense of the less favorably oriented domains. When the
external ﬁeld is removed, the sample may retain a net magnetization in the direction of the original ﬁeld. At ordinary temperatures, thermal agitation is not sufﬁcient to disrupt this preferred orientation of magnetic moments.
A typical experimental arrangement that is used to measure the magnetic
properties of a ferromagnetic material consists of a torus made of the material
wound with N turns of wire, as shown in Figure 30.29, where the windings are represented in black and are referred to as the primary coil. This apparatus is sometimes referred to as a Rowland ring. A secondary coil (the red wires in Fig. 30.29)
connected to a galvanometer is used to measure the total magnetic ﬂux through
the torus. The magnetic ﬁeld B in the torus is measured by increasing the current
in the toroid from zero to I . As the current changes, the magnetic ﬂux through

961

30.8 Magnetism in Matter

the secondary coil changes by an amount BA, where A is the cross-sectional area of
the toroid. As we shall ﬁnd in Chapter 31, because of this changing ﬂux, an emf
that is proportional to the rate of change in magnetic ﬂux is induced in the secondary coil. If the galvanometer is properly calibrated, a value for B corresponding to any value of the current in the primary coil can be obtained. The magnetic
ﬁeld B is measured ﬁrst in the absence of the torus and then with the torus in
place. The magnetic properties of the torus material are then obtained from a
comparison of the two measurements.
Now consider a torus made of unmagnetized iron. If the current in the primary coil is increased from zero to some value I, the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength H increases linearly with I according to the expression H ⫽ nI. Furthermore, the magnitude of the total ﬁeld B also increases with increasing current,
as shown by the curve from point O to point a in Figure 30.30. At point O, the domains in the iron are randomly oriented, corresponding to B m ⫽ 0. As the increasing current in the primary coil causes the external ﬁeld B0 to increase, the domains become more aligned until all of them are nearly aligned at point a. At this
point the iron core is approaching saturation, which is the condition in which all
domains in the iron are aligned.
Next, suppose that the current is reduced to zero, and the external ﬁeld is
consequently eliminated. The B versus H curve, called a magnetization curve,
now follows the path ab in Figure 30.30. Note that at point b, B is not zero even
though the external ﬁeld is B0 ⫽ 0. The reason is that the iron is now magnetized
due to the alignment of a large number of its domains (that is, B ⫽ Bm ). At this
point, the iron is said to have a remanent magnetization.
If the current in the primary coil is reversed so that the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld is reversed, the domains reorient until the sample is again unmagnetized at point c, where B ⫽ 0. An increase in the reverse current causes the
iron to be magnetized in the opposite direction, approaching saturation at point d
in Figure 30.30. A similar sequence of events occurs as the current is reduced to
zero and then increased in the original (positive) direction. In this case the magnetization curve follows the path def. If the current is increased sufﬁciently, the
magnetization curve returns to point a, where the sample again has its maximum
magnetization.
The effect just described, called magnetic hysteresis, shows that the magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance depends on the history of the substance as
well as on the magnitude of the applied ﬁeld. (The word hysteresis means “lagging
behind.”) It is often said that a ferromagnetic substance has a “memory” because it
remains magnetized after the external ﬁeld is removed. The closed loop in Figure
30.30 is referred to as a hysteresis loop. Its shape and size depend on the proper-

ties of the ferromagnetic substance and on the strength of the maximum applied
ﬁeld. The hysteresis loop for “hard” ferromagnetic materials is characteristically
wide like the one shown in Figure 30.31a, corresponding to a large remanent magnetization. Such materials cannot be easily demagnetized by an external ﬁeld.
“Soft” ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, have a very narrow hysteresis loop
and a small remanent magnetization (Fig. 30.31b.) Such materials are easily magnetized and demagnetized. An ideal soft ferromagnet would exhibit no hysteresis
and hence would have no remanent magnetization. A ferromagnetic substance
can be demagnetized by being carried through successive hysteresis loops, due to a
decreasing applied magnetic ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 30.32.

Quick Quiz 30.8
Which material would make a better permanent magnet, one whose hysteresis loop looks
like Figure 30.31a or one whose loop looks like Figure 30.31b?

The magnetization curve is useful for another reason: The area enclosed by
the magnetization curve represents the work required to take the material
through the hysteresis cycle. The energy acquired by the material in the magnetization process originates from the source of the external ﬁeld — that is, the emf
in the circuit of the toroidal coil. When the magnetization cycle is repeated, dissipative processes within the material due to realignment of the domains result in a
transformation of magnetic energy into internal energy, which is evidenced by an
increase in the temperature of the substance. For this reason, devices subjected to
alternating ﬁelds (such as ac adapters for cell phones, power tools, and so on) use
cores made of soft ferromagnetic substances, which have narrow hysteresis loops
and correspondingly little energy loss per cycle.
Magnetic computer disks store information by alternating the direction of B
for portions of a thin layer of ferromagnetic material. Floppy disks have the layer
on a circular sheet of plastic. Hard disks have several rigid platters with magnetic
coatings on each side. Audio tapes and videotapes work the same way as ﬂoppy
disks except that the ferromagnetic material is on a very long strip of plastic. Tiny
coils of wire in a recording head are placed close to the magnetic material (which
is moving rapidly past the head). Varying the current through the coils creates a
magnetic ﬁeld that magnetizes the recording material. To retrieve the information, the magnetized material is moved past a playback coil. The changing magnetism of the material induces a current in the coil, as we shall discuss in Chapter 31.
This current is then ampliﬁed by audio or video equipment, or it is processed by
computer circuitry.

30.8 Magnetism in Matter

Paramagnetism

M

Paramagnetic substances have a small but positive magnetic susceptibility
(0 ⬍ ␹ V 1) resulting from the presence of atoms (or ions) that have permanent
magnetic moments. These moments interact only weakly with each other and are
randomly oriented in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. When a paramagnetic substance is placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld, its atomic moments tend to
line up with the ﬁeld. However, this alignment process must compete with thermal
motion, which tends to randomize the magnetic moment orientations.
Pierre Curie (1859 – 1906) and others since him have found experimentally
that, under a wide range of conditions, the magnetization of a paramagnetic substance is proportional to the applied magnetic ﬁeld and inversely proportional to
the absolute temperature:
M⫽C

B0
T

(30.35)

This relationship is known as Curie’s law after its discoverer, and the constant C
is called Curie’s constant. The law shows that when B 0 ⫽ 0, the magnetization is
zero, corresponding to a random orientation of magnetic moments. As the ratio of
magnetic ﬁeld to temperature becomes great, the magnetization approaches its
saturation value, corresponding to a complete alignment of its moments, and
Equation 30.35 is no longer valid.
When the temperature of a ferromagnetic substance reaches or exceeds a
critical temperature called the Curie temperature, the substance loses its residual magnetization and becomes paramagnetic (Fig. 30.33). Below the Curie temperature, the magnetic moments are aligned and the substance is ferromagnetic. Above the Curie temperature, the thermal agitation is great enough to
cause a random orientation of the moments, and the substance becomes paramagnetic. Curie temperatures for several ferromagnetic substances are given in
Table 30.3.

Diamagnetism
When an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a diamagnetic substance, a weak
magnetic moment is induced in the direction opposite the applied ﬁeld. This
causes diamagnetic substances to be weakly repelled by a magnet. Although diamagnetism is present in all matter, its effects are much smaller than those of paramagnetism or ferromagnetism, and are evident only when those other effects do
not exist.
We can attain some understanding of diamagnetism by considering a classical
model of two atomic electrons orbiting the nucleus in opposite directions but with
the same speed. The electrons remain in their circular orbits because of the attractive electrostatic force exerted by the positively charged nucleus. Because the magnetic moments of the two electrons are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they cancel each other, and the magnetic moment of the atom is zero. When
an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the electrons experience an additional force
qv ⴛ B. This added force combines with the electrostatic force to increase the orbital speed of the electron whose magnetic moment is antiparallel to the ﬁeld and
to decrease the speed of the electron whose magnetic moment is parallel to the
ﬁeld. As a result, the two magnetic moments of the electrons no longer cancel,
and the substance acquires a net magnetic moment that is opposite the applied
ﬁeld.

As you recall from Chapter 27, a superconductor is a substance in which the
electrical resistance is zero below some critical temperature. Certain types of superconductors also exhibit perfect diamagnetism in the superconducting state. As
a result, an applied magnetic ﬁeld is expelled by the superconductor so that the
ﬁeld is zero in its interior. This phenomenon of ﬂux expulsion is known as the
Meissner effect. If a permanent magnet is brought near a superconductor,
the two objects repel each other. This is illustrated in Figure 30.34, which shows a
small permanent magnet levitated above a superconductor maintained at 77 K.

The saturation magnetization is obtained when

magnetization Ms has the value

where ␮ is the magnetic moment per atom. Because the molar mass of iron is 55 g/mol and its density is 7.9 g/cm3, the
value of n for iron is 8.6 ⫻ 1028 atoms/m3. Assuming that

each atom contributes one Bohr magneton (due to one unpaired spin) to the magnetic moment, we obtain

THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH

When we speak of a compass magnet having a north pole and a south pole, we
should say more properly that it has a “north-seeking” pole and a “south-seeking”
pole. By this we mean that one pole of the magnet seeks, or points to, the north
geographic pole of the Earth. Because the north pole of a magnet is attracted toward the north geographic pole of the Earth, we conclude that the Earth’s south
magnetic pole is located near the north geographic pole, and the Earth’s
north magnetic pole is located near the south geographic pole. In fact, the
conﬁguration of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, pictured in Figure 30.35, is very much
like the one that would be achieved by burying a gigantic bar magnet deep in the
interior of the Earth.

If a compass needle is suspended in bearings that allow it to rotate in the vertical plane as well as in the horizontal plane, the needle is horizontal with respect to
the Earth’s surface only near the equator. As the compass is moved northward, the
needle rotates so that it points more and more toward the surface of the Earth. Finally, at a point near Hudson Bay in Canada, the north pole of the needle points
directly downward. This site, ﬁrst found in 1832, is considered to be the location
of the south magnetic pole of the Earth. It is approximately 1 300 mi from the
Earth’s geographic North Pole, and its exact position varies slowly with time. Similarly, the north magnetic pole of the Earth is about 1 200 mi away from the Earth’s
geographic South Pole.
Because of this distance between the north geographic and south magnetic
poles, it is only approximately correct to say that a compass needle points north.
The difference between true north, deﬁned as the geographic North Pole, and
north indicated by a compass varies from point to point on the Earth, and the difference is referred to as magnetic declination. For example, along a line through
Florida and the Great Lakes, a compass indicates true north, whereas in Washington state, it aligns 25° east of true north.

The north end of a compass needle points
to the south magnetic pole of the Earth.
The “north” compass direction varies from
true geographic north depending on the
magnetic declination at that point on the
Earth’s surface.

A gold ring is very weakly repelled by
a magnet. To see this, suspend a 14or 18-karat gold ring on a long loop
of thread, as shown in (a). Gently tap
the ring and estimate its period of oscillation. Now bring the ring to rest,
letting it hang for a few moments so
that you can verify that it is not moving. Quickly bring a very strong magnet to within a few millimeters of the
ring, taking care not to bump it, as
shown in (b). Now pull the magnet
away. Repeat this action many times,
matching the oscillation period you
estimated earlier. This is just like
pushing a child on a swing. A small
force applied at the resonant frequency results in a large-amplitude
oscillation. If you have a platinum

effect except that platinum is weakly
attracted to a magnet because it is

Sources of the Magnetic Field

Quick Quiz 30.9
If we wanted to cancel the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld by running an enormous current loop
around the equator, which way would the current have to ﬂow: east to west or west to east?

Although the magnetic ﬁeld pattern of the Earth is similar to the one that
would be set up by a bar magnet deep within the Earth, it is easy to understand
why the source of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld cannot be large masses of permanently magnetized material. The Earth does have large deposits of iron ore deep
beneath its surface, but the high temperatures in the Earth’s core prevent the iron
from retaining any permanent magnetization. Scientists consider it more likely
that the true source of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is charge-carrying convection
currents in the Earth’s core. Charged ions or electrons circulating in the liquid interior could produce a magnetic ﬁeld just as a current loop does. There is also
strong evidence that the magnitude of a planet’s magnetic ﬁeld is related to the
planet’s rate of rotation. For example, Jupiter rotates faster than the Earth, and
space probes indicate that Jupiter’s magnetic ﬁeld is stronger than ours. Venus, on
the other hand, rotates more slowly than the Earth, and its magnetic ﬁeld is found
to be weaker. Investigation into the cause of the Earth’s magnetism is ongoing.
There is an interesting sidelight concerning the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. It has
been found that the direction of the ﬁeld has been reversed several times during
the last million years. Evidence for this is provided by basalt, a type of rock that
contains iron and that forms from material spewed forth by volcanic activity on the
ocean ﬂoor. As the lava cools, it solidiﬁes and retains a picture of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld direction. The rocks are dated by other means to provide a timeline for
these periodic reversals of the magnetic ﬁeld.

30.4 b, then a ⫽ c ⫽ d. Paths a, c, and d all give the same
nonzero value ␮0 I because the size and shape of the
paths do not matter. Path b does not enclose the current, and hence its line integral is zero.
30.5 Net force, yes; net torque, no. The forces on the top and
bottom of the loop cancel because they are equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction. The current in the
left side of the loop is parallel to I1 , and hence the force
F L exerted by I 1 on this side is attractive. The current in
the right side of the loop is antiparallel to I1 , and hence
the force FR exerted by I 1 on this side of the loop is repulsive. Because the left side is closer to wire 1, F L ⬎ F R
and a net force is directed toward wire 1. Because the

he focus of our studies in electricity and magnetism so far has been the electric ﬁelds produced by stationary charges and the magnetic ﬁelds produced by
moving charges. This chapter deals with electric ﬁelds produced by changing
magnetic ﬁelds.
Experiments conducted by Michael Faraday in England in 1831 and independently by Joseph Henry in the United States that same year showed that an emf
can be induced in a circuit by a changing magnetic ﬁeld. As we shall see, an emf
(and therefore a current as well) can be induced in many ways — for instance, by
moving a closed loop of wire into a region where a magnetic ﬁeld exists. The results of these experiments led to a very basic and important law of electromagnetism known as Faraday’s law of induction. This law states that the magnitude of the
emf induced in a circuit equals the time rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux
through the circuit.
With the treatment of Faraday’s law, we complete our introduction to the fundamental laws of electromagnetism. These laws can be summarized in a set of four
equations called Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz force law, which we
discuss brieﬂy, they represent a complete theory for describing the interaction of
charged objects. Maxwell’s equations relate electric and magnetic ﬁelds to each
other and to their ultimate source, namely, electric charges.

FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION

To see how an emf can be induced by a changing magnetic ﬁeld, let us consider a
loop of wire connected to a galvanometer, as illustrated in Figure 31.1. When a
magnet is moved toward the loop, the galvanometer needle deﬂects in one direction, arbitrarily shown to the right in Figure 31.1a. When the magnet is moved
away from the loop, the needle deﬂects in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 31.1c. When the magnet is held stationary relative to the loop (Fig. 31.1b), no
deﬂection is observed. Finally, if the magnet is held stationary and the loop is
moved either toward or away from it, the needle deﬂects. From these observations,
we conclude that the loop “knows” that the magnet is moving relative to it because
it experiences a change in magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, it seems that a relationship exists
between current and changing magnetic ﬁeld.
These results are quite remarkable in view of the fact that a current is set up
even though no batteries are present in the circuit! We call such a current an
induced current and say that it is produced by an induced emf.
Now let us describe an experiment conducted by Faraday 1 and illustrated in
Figure 31.2. A primary coil is connected to a switch and a battery. The coil is
wrapped around a ring, and a current in the coil produces a magnetic ﬁeld when
the switch is closed. A secondary coil also is wrapped around the ring and is connected to a galvanometer. No battery is present in the secondary circuit, and the
secondary coil is not connected to the primary coil. Any current detected in the
secondary circuit must be induced by some external agent.
Initially, you might guess that no current is ever detected in the secondary circuit. However, something quite amazing happens when the switch in the primary

A physicist named J. D. Colladon was the ﬁrst to perform the moving-magnet experiment. To minimize the effect of the changing magnetic ﬁeld on his galvanometer, he placed the meter in an adjacent
room. Thus, as he moved the magnet in the loop, he could not see the meter needle deﬂecting. By the
time he returned next door to read the galvanometer, the needle was back to zero because he had
stopped moving the magnet. Unfortunately for Colladon, there must be relative motion between the
loop and the magnet for an induced emf and a corresponding induced current to be observed. Thus,
physics students learn Faraday’s law of induction rather than “Colladon’s law of induction.”

Faraday, a British physicist and

greatest experimental scientist of the
1800s. His many contributions to the
study of electricity include the invention of the electric motor, electric
generator, and transformer, as well as
the discovery of electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis.
Greatly inﬂuenced by religion, he refused to work on the development of

standing what happens in this experiment is to ﬁrst note that when the switch is
closed, the current in the primary circuit produces a magnetic ﬁeld in the region
of the circuit, and it is this magnetic ﬁeld that penetrates the secondary circuit.
Furthermore, when the switch is closed, the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the current in the primary circuit changes from zero to some value over some ﬁnite time,
and it is this changing ﬁeld that induces a current in the secondary circuit.
As a result of these observations, Faraday concluded that an electric current
can be induced in a circuit (the secondary circuit in our setup) by a changing magnetic ﬁeld. The induced current exists for only a short time while the
magnetic ﬁeld through the secondary coil is changing. Once the magnetic ﬁeld
reaches a steady value, the current in the secondary coil disappears. In effect, the
secondary circuit behaves as though a source of emf were connected to it for a
short time. It is customary to say that an induced emf is produced in the secondary circuit by the changing magnetic ﬁeld.
The experiments shown in Figures 31.1 and 31.2 have one thing in common:
In each case, an emf is induced in the circuit when the magnetic ﬂux through the
circuit changes with time. In general,
the emf induced in a circuit is directly proportional to the time rate of change
of the magnetic ﬂux through the circuit.
This statement, known as Faraday’s law of induction, can be written

␧ ⫽ ⫺ ddt⌽B

Faraday’s law

(31.1)

where ⌽B ⫽ 冕B ⴢ dA is the magnetic ﬂux through the circuit (see Section 30.5).
If the circuit is a coil consisting of N loops all of the same area and if ⌽B is the
ﬂux through one loop, an emf is induced in every loop; thus, the total induced
emf in the coil is given by the expression

Equation 31.3 can be used to calculate the emf induced when the north pole of a magnet is

moved toward the loop?

A cassette tape is made up of tiny particles of metal oxide attached to a
long plastic strip. A current in a small
conducting loop magnetizes the particles in a pattern related to the music
being recorded. During playback, the
tape is moved past a second small
loop (inside the playback head) and
induces a current that is then ampliﬁed. Pull a strip of tape out of a cassette (one that you don’t mind
recording over) and see if it is attracted or repelled by a refrigerator
magnet. If you don’t have a cassette,
try this with an old ﬂoppy disk you
are ready to trash.

Some Applications of Faraday’s Law
The ground fault interrupter (GFI) is an interesting safety device that protects
users of electrical appliances against electric shock. Its operation makes use of
Faraday’s law. In the GFI shown in Figure 31.4, wire 1 leads from the wall outlet to
the appliance to be protected, and wire 2 leads from the appliance back to the wall
outlet. An iron ring surrounds the two wires, and a sensing coil is wrapped around
part of the ring. Because the currents in the wires are in opposite directions, the
net magnetic ﬂux through the sensing coil due to the currents is zero. However, if
the return current in wire 2 changes, the net magnetic ﬂux through the sensing
coil is no longer zero. (This can happen, for example, if the appliance gets wet,
enabling current to leak to ground.) Because household current is alternating
(meaning that its direction keeps reversing), the magnetic ﬂux through the sensing coil changes with time, inducing an emf in the coil. This induced emf is used
to trigger a circuit breaker, which stops the current before it is able to reach a
harmful level.
Another interesting application of Faraday’s law is the production of sound in
an electric guitar (Fig. 31.5). The coil in this case, called the pickup coil, is placed
near the vibrating guitar string, which is made of a metal that can be magnetized.
A permanent magnet inside the coil magnetizes the portion of the string nearest

of a special glass. The current produces an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld,
which induces a current in the
cooking utensil. Because the cooking utensil has some electrical resistance, the electrical energy associated with the induced current is
transformed to internal energy,
causing the utensil and its contents
to become hot. (Courtesy of Corning,

A coil consists of 200 turns of wire having a total resistance of
2.0 ⍀. Each turn is a square of side 18 cm, and a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld directed perpendicular to the plane of the coil
is turned on. If the ﬁeld changes linearly from 0 to 0.50 T in

while the ﬁeld is changing?

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 31.3

What Is Connected to What?

Two bulbs are connected to opposite sides of a loop of wire,
as shown in Figure 31.7. A decreasing magnetic ﬁeld (conﬁned to the circular area shown in the ﬁgure) induces an
emf in the loop that causes the two bulbs to light. What happens to the brightness of the bulbs when the switch is closed?

Solution Bulb 1 glows brighter, and bulb 2 goes out. Once
the switch is closed, bulb 1 is in the large loop consisting of
the wire to which it is attached and the wire connected to the
switch. Because the changing magnetic ﬂux is completely enclosed within this loop, a current exists in bulb 1. Bulb 1 now
glows brighter than before the switch was closed because it is

now the only resistance in the loop. As a result, the current in
bulb 1 is greater than when bulb 2 was also in the loop.
Once the switch is closed, bulb 2 is in the loop consisting
of the wires attached to it and those connected to the switch.
There is no changing magnetic ﬂux through this loop and
hence no induced emf.

MOTIONAL EMF

In Examples 31.1 and 31.2, we considered cases in which an emf is induced in a
stationary circuit placed in a magnetic ﬁeld when the ﬁeld changes with time. In
this section we describe what is called motional emf, which is the emf induced in
a conductor moving through a constant magnetic ﬁeld.
The straight conductor of length ᐉ shown in Figure 31.8 is moving through a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld directed into the page. For simplicity, we assume that the
conductor is moving in a direction perpendicular to the ﬁeld with constant veloc-

ity under the inﬂuence of some external agent. The electrons in the conductor experience a force FB ⫽ q v ⴛ B that is directed along the length ᐉ, perpendicular to
both v and B (Eq. 29.1). Under the inﬂuence of this force, the electrons move to
the lower end of the conductor and accumulate there, leaving a net positive
charge at the upper end. As a result of this charge separation, an electric ﬁeld is
produced inside the conductor. The charges accumulate at both ends until the
downward magnetic force qvB is balanced by the upward electric force q E. At this
point, electrons stop moving. The condition for equilibrium requires that
q E ⫽ q vB

E ⫽ vB

or

The electric ﬁeld produced in the conductor (once the electrons stop moving and
E is constant) is related to the potential difference across the ends of the conductor according to the relationship ⌬V ⫽ Eᐉ (Eq. 25.6). Thus,
⌬V ⫽ Eᐉ ⫽ Bᐉv

(31.4)

where the upper end is at a higher electric potential than the lower end. Thus, a
potential difference is maintained between the ends of the conductor as
long as the conductor continues to move through the uniform magnetic
ﬁeld. If the direction of the motion is reversed, the polarity of the potential difference also is reversed.
A more interesting situation occurs when the moving conductor is part of a
closed conducting path. This situation is particularly useful for illustrating how a
changing magnetic ﬂux causes an induced current in a closed circuit. Consider a
circuit consisting of a conducting bar of length ᐉ sliding along two ﬁxed parallel
conducting rails, as shown in Figure 31.9a.
For simplicity, we assume that the bar has zero resistance and that the stationary part of the circuit has a resistance R. A uniform and constant magnetic ﬁeld B
is applied perpendicular to the plane of the circuit. As the bar is pulled to the
right with a velocity v, under the inﬂuence of an applied force Fapp , free charges
in the bar experience a magnetic force directed along the length of the bar. This
force sets up an induced current because the charges are free to move in the
closed conducting path. In this case, the rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through
the loop and the corresponding induced motional emf across the moving bar are
proportional to the change in area of the loop. As we shall see, if the bar is pulled
to the right with a constant velocity, the work done by the applied force appears as
internal energy in the resistor R (see Section 27.6).
Because the area enclosed by the circuit at any instant is ᐉx, where x is the
width of the circuit at any instant, the magnetic ﬂux through that area is

31.2 Motional EMF

Let us examine the system using energy considerations. Because no battery is
in the circuit, we might wonder about the origin of the induced current and the
electrical energy in the system. We can understand the source of this current and
energy by noting that the applied force does work on the conducting bar, thereby
moving charges through a magnetic ﬁeld. Their movement through the ﬁeld
causes the charges to move along the bar with some average drift velocity, and
hence a current is established. Because energy must be conserved, the work done
by the applied force on the bar during some time interval must equal the electrical
energy supplied by the induced emf during that same interval. Furthermore, if the
bar moves with constant speed, the work done on it must equal the energy delivered to the resistor during this time interval.
As it moves through the uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, the bar experiences a magnetic force FB of magnitude I ᐉB (see Section 29.2). The direction of this force is
opposite the motion of the bar, to the left in Figure 31.9a. Because the bar moves
with constant velocity, the applied force must be equal in magnitude and opposite
in direction to the magnetic force, or to the right in Figure 31.9a. (If FB acted in
the direction of motion, it would cause the bar to accelerate. Such a situation
would violate the principle of conservation of energy.) Using Equation 31.6 and
the fact that F app ⫽ IᐉB, we ﬁnd that the power delivered by the applied force is

LENZ’S LAW

Faraday’s law (Eq. 31.1) indicates that the induced emf and the change in ﬂux
have opposite algebraic signs. This has a very real physical interpretation that has
come to be known as Lenz’s law2:
2

Developed by the German physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804 – 1865).

989

31.3 Lenz’s Law

The polarity of the induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current that
creates a magnetic ﬂux to oppose the change in magnetic ﬂux through the area
enclosed by the current loop.
R

That is, the induced current tends to keep the original magnetic ﬂux through the
circuit from changing. As we shall see, this law is a consequence of the law of conservation of energy.
To understand Lenz’s law, let us return to the example of a bar moving to the
right on two parallel rails in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld that we shall
refer to as the external magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 31.12a). As the bar moves to the right,
the magnetic ﬂux through the area enclosed by the circuit increases with time because the area increases. Lenz’s law states that the induced current must be directed so that the magnetic ﬂux it produces opposes the change in the external
magnetic ﬂux. Because the external magnetic ﬂux is increasing into the page, the
induced current, if it is to oppose this change, must produce a ﬂux directed out of
the page. Hence, the induced current must be directed counterclockwise when
the bar moves to the right. (Use the right-hand rule to verify this direction.) If the
bar is moving to the left, as shown in Figure 31.12b, the external magnetic ﬂux
through the area enclosed by the loop decreases with time. Because the ﬂux is directed into the page, the direction of the induced current must be clockwise if it is
to produce a ﬂux that also is directed into the page. In either case, the induced
current tends to maintain the original ﬂux through the area enclosed by the current loop.
Let us examine this situation from the viewpoint of energy considerations.
Suppose that the bar is given a slight push to the right. In the preceding analysis,
we found that this motion sets up a counterclockwise current in the loop. Let us
see what happens if we assume that the current is clockwise, such that the direction of the magnetic force exerted on the bar is to the right. This force would accelerate the rod and increase its velocity. This, in turn, would cause the area enclosed by the loop to increase more rapidly; this would result in an increase in the
induced current, which would cause an increase in the force, which would produce an increase in the current, and so on. In effect, the system would acquire energy with no additional input of energy. This is clearly inconsistent with all experience and with the law of conservation of energy. Thus, we are forced to conclude
that the current must be counterclockwise.
Let us consider another situation, one in which a bar magnet moves toward a
stationary metal loop, as shown in Figure 31.13a. As the magnet moves to the right
toward the loop, the external magnetic ﬂux through the loop increases with time.
To counteract this increase in ﬂux to the right, the induced current produces a
ﬂux to the left, as illustrated in Figure 31.13b; hence, the induced current is in the
direction shown. Note that the magnetic ﬁeld lines associated with the induced
current oppose the motion of the magnet. Knowing that like magnetic poles repel
each other, we conclude that the left face of the current loop is in essence a north
pole and that the right face is a south pole.
If the magnet moves to the left, as shown in Figure 31.13c, its ﬂux through the
area enclosed by the loop, which is directed to the right, decreases in time. Now
the induced current in the loop is in the direction shown in Figure 31.13d because
this current direction produces a magnetic ﬂux in the same direction as the external ﬂux. In this case, the left face of the loop is a south pole and the right face is a
north pole.

Solution (a) At the instant the switch is thrown closed, the
situation changes from one in which no magnetic ﬂux passes
through the ring to one in which ﬂux passes through in the
direction shown in Figure 31.15b. To counteract this change
in the ﬂux, the current induced in the ring must set up a
magnetic ﬁeld directed from left to right in Figure 31.15b.
This requires a current directed as shown.

A Loop Moving Through a Magnetic Field

A rectangular metallic loop of dimensions ᐉ and w and resistance R moves with constant speed v to the right, as shown in
Figure 31.16a, passing through a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B
directed into the page and extending a distance 3w along the
x axis. Deﬁning x as the position of the right side of the loop
along the x axis, plot as functions of x (a) the magnetic ﬂux
through the area enclosed by the loop, (b) the induced motional emf, and (c) the external applied force necessary to
counter the magnetic force and keep v constant.

Solution (a) Figure 31.16b shows the ﬂux through the
area enclosed by the loop as a function x. Before the loop enters the ﬁeld, the ﬂux is zero. As the loop enters the ﬁeld, the
ﬂux increases linearly with position until the left edge of the
loop is just inside the ﬁeld. Finally, the ﬂux through the loop
decreases linearly to zero as the loop leaves the ﬁeld.
(b) Before the loop enters the ﬁeld, no motional emf is
induced in it because no ﬁeld is present (Fig. 31.16c). As
the right side of the loop enters the ﬁeld, the magnetic
ﬂux directed into the page increases. Hence, according to
Lenz’s law, the induced current is counterclockwise because
it must produce a magnetic ﬁeld directed out of the page.
The motional emf ⫺Bᐉv (from Eq. 31.5) arises from the mag-

netic force experienced by charges in the right side of the
loop. When the loop is entirely in the ﬁeld, the change in
magnetic ﬂux is zero, and hence the motional emf vanishes.
This happens because, once the left side of the loop enters
the ﬁeld, the motional emf induced in it cancels the motional
emf present in the right side of the loop. As the right side of
the loop leaves the ﬁeld, the ﬂux inward begins to decrease, a
clockwise current is induced, and the induced emf is Bᐉv. As
soon as the left side leaves the ﬁeld, the emf decreases to
zero.
(c) The external force that must be applied to the loop to
maintain this motion is plotted in Figure 31.16d. Before the
loop enters the ﬁeld, no magnetic force acts on it; hence, the
applied force must be zero if v is constant. When the right
side of the loop enters the ﬁeld, the applied force necessary
to maintain constant speed must be equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction to the magnetic force exerted on that
side: FB ⫽ ⫺IᐉB ⫽ ⫺B 2 ᐉ 2v/R . When the loop is entirely in
the ﬁeld, the ﬂux through the loop is not changing with
time. Hence, the net emf induced in the loop is zero, and the
current also is zero. Therefore, no external force is needed to
maintain the motion. Finally, as the right side leaves the ﬁeld,
the applied force must be equal in magnitude and opposite

Furthermore, this example shows that the motional emf induced in the loop can be zero even when there is motion

the loop.
From this analysis, we conclude that power is supplied
only when the loop is either entering or leaving the ﬁeld.

INDUCED EMF AND ELECTRIC FIELDS

We have seen that a changing magnetic ﬂux induces an emf and a current in a
conducting loop. Therefore, we must conclude that an electric ﬁeld is created
in the conductor as a result of the changing magnetic ﬂux. However, this induced electric ﬁeld has two important properties that distinguish it from the electrostatic ﬁeld produced by stationary charges: The induced ﬁeld is nonconservative and can vary in time.
We can illustrate this point by considering a conducting loop of radius r situated in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, as
shown in Figure 31.17. If the magnetic ﬁeld changes with time, then, according to
Faraday’s law (Eq. 31.1), an emf ⫽ ⫺d⌽B /dt is induced in the loop. The induction of a current in the loop implies the presence of an induced electric ﬁeld E,
which must be tangent to the loop because all points on the loop are equivalent.
The work done in moving a test charge q once around the loop is equal to q . Because the electric force acting on the charge is q E, the work done by this force in
moving the charge once around the loop is qE(2␲r), where 2 ␲ r is the circumference of the loop. These two expressions for the work must be equal; therefore, we
see that

(31.8)

If the time variation of the magnetic ﬁeld is speciﬁed, we can easily calculate the
induced electric ﬁeld from Equation 31.8. The negative sign indicates that the induced electric ﬁeld opposes the change in the magnetic ﬁeld.
The emf for any closed path can be expressed as the line integral of E ⴢ ds over
that path: ⫽ 冖E ⴢ ds. In more general cases, E may not be constant, and the path
may not be a circle. Hence, Faraday’s law of induction, ⫽ ⫺d⌽B /dt, can be written in the general form

It is important to recognize that the induced electric ﬁeld E in Equation
31.9 is a nonconservative ﬁeld that is generated by a changing magnetic
ﬁeld. The ﬁeld E that satisﬁes Equation 31.9 cannot possibly be an electrostatic
ﬁeld for the following reason: If the ﬁeld were electrostatic, and hence conservative, the line integral of E ⴢ ds over a closed loop would be zero; this would be in
contradiction to Equation 31.9.

EXAMPLE 31.8

Electric Field Induced by a Changing Magnetic Field in a Solenoid

A long solenoid of radius R has n turns of wire per unit
length and carries a time-varying current that varies sinusoidally as I ⫽ Imax cos ␻t, where I max is the maximum current and ␻ is the angular frequency of the alternating current
source (Fig. 31.18). (a) Determine the magnitude of the induced electric ﬁeld outside the solenoid, a distance r ⬎ R
from its long central axis.

Solution

First let us consider an external point and take
the path for our line integral to be a circle of radius r centered on the solenoid, as illustrated in Figure 31.18. By sym-

Answer

This shows that the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld induced inside the solenoid by the changing magnetic ﬂux through the
solenoid increases linearly with r and varies sinusoidally with
time.

Yes, it could be much stronger because the maximum magnetic ﬁeld (and thus the change in ﬂux) through
the solenoid could be thousands of times larger. (See Example 30.10.)

GENERATORS AND MOTORS

Electric generators are used to produce electrical energy. To understand how they
work, let us consider the alternating current (ac) generator, a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. In its simplest form, it consists of a
loop of wire rotated by some external means in a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 31.19a).
In commercial power plants, the energy required to rotate the loop can be derived from a variety of sources. For example, in a hydroelectric plant, falling water
directed against the blades of a turbine produces the rotary motion; in a coal-ﬁred
plant, the energy released by burning coal is used to convert water to steam, and
this steam is directed against the turbine blades. As a loop rotates in a magnetic
ﬁeld, the magnetic ﬂux through the area enclosed by the loop changes with time;
this induces an emf and a current in the loop according to Faraday’s law. The ends
of the loop are connected to slip rings that rotate with the loop. Connections from
these slip rings, which act as output terminals of the generator, to the external circuit are made by stationary brushes in contact with the slip rings.

Suppose that, instead of a single turn, the loop has N turns (a more practical
situation), all of the same area A, and rotates in a magnetic ﬁeld with a constant
angular speed ␻. If ␪ is the angle between the magnetic ﬁeld and the normal to
the plane of the loop, as shown in Figure 31.20, then the magnetic ﬂux through
the loop at any time t is

The direct current (dc) generator is illustrated in Figure 31.21a. Such generators are used, for instance, in older cars to charge the storage batteries used. The
components are essentially the same as those of the ac generator except that the
contacts to the rotating loop are made using a split ring called a commutator.
In this conﬁguration, the output voltage always has the same polarity and pulsates with time, as shown in Figure 31.21b. We can understand the reason for this
by noting that the contacts to the split ring reverse their roles every half cycle. At
the same time, the polarity of the induced emf reverses; hence, the polarity of the

split ring (which is the same as the polarity of the output voltage) remains the
same.
A pulsating dc current is not suitable for most applications. To obtain a more
steady dc current, commercial dc generators use many coils and commutators distributed so that the sinusoidal pulses from the various coils are out of phase. When
these pulses are superimposed, the dc output is almost free of ﬂuctuations.
Motors are devices that convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. Essentially, a motor is a generator operating in reverse. Instead of generating a current
by rotating a loop, a current is supplied to the loop by a battery, and the torque
acting on the current-carrying loop causes it to rotate.
Useful mechanical work can be done by attaching the rotating armature to
some external device. However, as the loop rotates in a magnetic ﬁeld, the changing magnetic ﬂux induces an emf in the loop; this induced emf always acts to reduce the current in the loop. If this were not the case, Lenz’s law would be violated. The back emf increases in magnitude as the rotational speed of the
armature increases. (The phrase back emf is used to indicate an emf that tends to
reduce the supplied current.) Because the voltage available to supply current
equals the difference between the supply voltage and the back emf, the current in
the rotating coil is limited by the back emf.
When a motor is turned on, there is initially no back emf; thus, the current is
very large because it is limited only by the resistance of the coils. As the coils begin
to rotate, the induced back emf opposes the applied voltage, and the current in
the coils is reduced. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; this
causes the back emf to decrease. This reduction in the back emf increases the current in the coils and therefore also increases the power needed from the external
voltage source. For this reason, the power requirements for starting a motor and
for running it are greater for heavy loads than for light ones. If the motor is allowed to run under no mechanical load, the back emf reduces the current to a
value just large enough to overcome energy losses due to internal energy and friction. If a very heavy load jams the motor so that it cannot rotate, the lack of a back
emf can lead to dangerously high current in the motor’s wire. If the problem is
not corrected, a ﬁre could result.

EXAMPLE 31.10

The Induced Current in a Motor

Assume that a motor in which the coils have a total resistance
of 10 ⍀ is supplied by a voltage of 120 V. When the motor is
running at its maximum speed, the back emf is 70 V. Find the
current in the coils (a) when the motor is turned on and
(b) when it has reached maximum speed.

Solution (a) When the motor is turned on, the back emf
is zero (because the coils are motionless). Thus, the current
in the coils is a maximum and equal to

31.6

As we have seen, an emf and a current are induced in a circuit by a changing magnetic ﬂux. In the same manner, circulating currents called eddy currents are induced in bulk pieces of metal moving through a magnetic ﬁeld. This can easily be
demonstrated by allowing a ﬂat copper or aluminum plate attached at the end of a
rigid bar to swing back and forth through a magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. 31.22). As the
plate enters the ﬁeld, the changing magnetic ﬂux induces an emf in the plate,
which in turn causes the free electrons in the plate to move, producing the
swirling eddy currents. According to Lenz’s law, the direction of the eddy currents
must oppose the change that causes them. For this reason, the eddy currents must
produce effective magnetic poles on the plate, which are repelled by the poles of
the magnet; this gives rise to a repulsive force that opposes the motion of the
plate. (If the opposite were true, the plate would accelerate and its energy would

leaves the ﬁeld, the changing magnetic ﬂux induces an emf,
which causes eddy currents in the plate.

QuickLab
Hang a strong magnet from two
strings so that it swings back and
forth in a plane. Start it oscillating
and determine approximately how
much time passes before it stops
swinging. Start it oscillating again and
quickly bring the ﬂat surface of an
aluminum cooking sheet up to within
a millimeter of the plane of oscillation, taking care not to touch the
magnet. How long does it take the oscillating magnet to stop now?

increase after each swing, in violation of the law of conservation of energy.) As you
may have noticed while carrying out the QuickLab on page 997, you can “feel” the
retarding force by pulling a copper or aluminum sheet through the ﬁeld of a
strong magnet.
As indicated in Figure 31.23, with B directed into the page, the induced eddy
current is counterclockwise as the swinging plate enters the ﬁeld at position 1.
This is because the external magnetic ﬂux into the page through the plate is increasing, and hence by Lenz’s law the induced current must provide a magnetic
ﬂux out of the page. The opposite is true as the plate leaves the ﬁeld at position 2,
where the current is clockwise. Because the induced eddy current always produces
a magnetic retarding force FB when the plate enters or leaves the ﬁeld, the swinging plate eventually comes to rest.
If slots are cut in the plate, as shown in Figure 31.24, the eddy currents and the
corresponding retarding force are greatly reduced. We can understand this by realizing that the cuts in the plate prevent the formation of any large current loops.
The braking systems on many subway and rapid-transit cars make use of electromagnetic induction and eddy currents. An electromagnet attached to the train
is positioned near the steel rails. (An electromagnet is essentially a solenoid with
an iron core.) The braking action occurs when a large current is passed through
the electromagnet. The relative motion of the magnet and rails induces eddy currents in the rails, and the direction of these currents produces a drag force on the
moving train. The loss in mechanical energy of the train is transformed to internal
energy in the rails and wheels. Because the eddy currents decrease steadily in magnitude as the train slows down, the braking effect is quite smooth. Eddycurrent brakes are also used in some mechanical balances and in various machines. Some power tools use eddy currents to stop rapidly spinning blades once
the device is turned off.

As the conducting
plate enters the ﬁeld (position 1),
the eddy currents are counterclockwise. As the plate leaves the ﬁeld
(position 2), the currents are clockwise. In either case, the force on
the plate is opposite the velocity,
and eventually the plate comes to
rest.

coin has the correct speed, gate B swings up to allow the coin to be accepted. If the coin is not
moving at the correct speed, gate C opens to allow the coin to follow the reject path.

31.7 Maxwell’s Wonderful Equations

Eddy currents are often undesirable because they represent a transformation
of mechanical energy to internal energy. To reduce this energy loss, moving conducting parts are often laminated — that is, they are built up in thin layers separated by a nonconducting material such as lacquer or a metal oxide. This layered
structure increases the resistance of the possible paths of the eddy currents and effectively conﬁnes the currents to individual layers. Such a laminated structure is
used in transformer cores and motors to minimize eddy currents and thereby increase the efﬁciency of these devices.
Even a task as simple as buying a candy bar from a vending machine involves
eddy currents, as shown in Figure 31.25. After entering the slot, a coin is stopped
momentarily while its electrical resistance is checked. If its resistance falls within
an acceptable range, the coin is allowed to continue down a ramp and through a
magnetic ﬁeld. As it moves through the ﬁeld, eddy currents are produced in the
coin, and magnetic forces slow it down slightly. How much it is slowed down depends on its metallic composition. Sensors measure the coin’s speed after it moves
past the magnets, and this speed is compared with expected values. If the coin is
legal and passes these tests, a gate is opened and the coin is accepted; otherwise, a
second gate moves it into the reject path.

MAXWELL’S WONDERFUL EQUATIONS

We conclude this chapter by presenting four equations that are regarded as the baof all electrical and magnetic phenomena. These equations, developed by
James Clerk Maxwell, are as fundamental to electromagnetic phenomena as Newton’s laws are to mechanical phenomena. In fact, the theory that Maxwell developed was more far-reaching than even he imagined because it turned out to be in
agreement with the special theory of relativity, as Einstein showed in 1905.
Maxwell’s equations represent the laws of electricity and magnetism that we
have already discussed, but they have additional important consequences. In
Chapter 34 we shall show that these equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves (traveling patterns of electric and magnetic ﬁelds), which travel with a
speed c ⫽ 1/!␮0⑀0 ⫽ 3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s, the speed of light. Furthermore, the theory
shows that such waves are radiated by accelerating charges.
For simplicity, we present Maxwell’s equations as applied to free space, that
is, in the absence of any dielectric or magnetic material. The four equations are

CHAPTER 31

Faraday’s Law

Equation 31.12 is Gauss’s law: The total electric ﬂux through any closed
surface equals the net charge inside that surface divided by ⑀ 0 . This law relates an electric ﬁeld to the charge distribution that creates it.
Equation 31.13, which can be considered Gauss’s law in magnetism, states that
the net magnetic ﬂux through a closed surface is zero. That is, the number of
magnetic ﬁeld lines that enter a closed volume must equal the number that leave
that volume. This implies that magnetic ﬁeld lines cannot begin or end at any
point. If they did, it would mean that isolated magnetic monopoles existed at
those points. The fact that isolated magnetic monopoles have not been observed
in nature can be taken as a conﬁrmation of Equation 31.13.
Equation 31.14 is Faraday’s law of induction, which describes the creation of
an electric ﬁeld by a changing magnetic ﬂux. This law states that the emf, which
is the line integral of the electric ﬁeld around any closed path, equals the
rate of change of magnetic ﬂux through any surface area bounded by that
path. One consequence of Faraday’s law is the current induced in a conducting
loop placed in a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld.
Equation 31.15, usually called the Ampère – Maxwell law, is the generalized
form of Ampère’s law, which describes the creation of a magnetic ﬁeld by an electric ﬁeld and electric currents: The line integral of the magnetic ﬁeld around
any closed path is the sum of ␮0 times the net current through that path
and ⑀0␮0 times the rate of change of electric ﬂux through any surface
bounded by that path.
Once the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are known at some point in space, the
force acting on a particle of charge q can be calculated from the expression
F ⫽ qE ⫹ q v ⴛ B

Lorentz force law

(31.16)

This relationship is called the Lorentz force law. (We saw this relationship earlier
as Equation 29.16.) Maxwell’s equations, together with this force law, completely
describe all classical electromagnetic interactions.
It is interesting to note the symmetry of Maxwell’s equations. Equations 31.12
and 31.13 are symmetric, apart from the absence of the term for magnetic monopoles in Equation 31.13. Furthermore, Equations 31.14 and 31.15 are symmetric in
that the line integrals of E and B around a closed path are related to the rate of
change of magnetic ﬂux and electric ﬂux, respectively. “Maxwell’s wonderful equations,” as they were called by John R. Pierce,3 are of fundamental importance not
only to electromagnetism but to all of science. Heinrich Hertz once wrote, “One
cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulas have an independent
existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser
even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than we put into them.”

component in the northern hemisphere. As the plane

positively charged and the right wingtip negatively
charged.

31.3 Inserting. Because the south pole of the magnet is nearest the solenoid, the ﬁeld lines created by the magnet
point upward in Figure 31.14. Because the current induced in the solenoid is clockwise when viewed from
above, the magnetic ﬁeld lines produced by this current
point downward in Figure 31.14. If the magnet were being withdrawn, it would create a decreasing upward ﬂux.
The induced current would counteract this decrease by
producing its own upward ﬂux. This would require a
counterclockwise current in the solenoid, contrary to
what is observed.

I

n Chapter 31, we saw that emfs and currents are induced in a circuit when the
magnetic ﬂux through the area enclosed by the circuit changes with time. This
electromagnetic induction has some practical consequences, which we describe
in this chapter. First, we describe an effect known as self-induction, in which a timevarying current in a circuit produces in the circuit an induced emf that opposes
the emf that initially set up the time-varying current. Self-induction is the basis of
the inductor, an electrical element that has an important role in circuits that use
time-varying currents. We discuss the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of an inductor and the energy density associated with the magnetic ﬁeld.
Next, we study how an emf is induced in a circuit as a result of a changing
magnetic ﬂux produced by a second circuit; this is the basic principle of mutual induction. Finally, we examine the characteristics of circuits that contain inductors,
resistors, and capacitors in various combinations.

SELF-INDUCTANCE

32.1

In this chapter, we need to distinguish carefully between emfs and currents that
are caused by batteries or other sources and those that are induced by changing
magnetic ﬁelds. We use the adjective source (as in the terms source emf and source
current) to describe the parameters associated with a physical source, and we use
the adjective induced to describe those emfs and currents caused by a changing
magnetic ﬁeld.
Consider a circuit consisting of a switch, a resistor, and a source of emf, as
shown in Figure 32.1. When the switch is thrown to its closed position, the source
current does not immediately jump from zero to its maximum value /R. Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction (Eq. 31.1) can be used to describe this effect as follows: As the source current increases with time, the magnetic ﬂux
through the circuit loop due to this current also increases with time. This increasing ﬂux creates an induced emf in the circuit. The direction of the induced emf is
such that it would cause an induced current in the loop (if a current were not already ﬂowing in the loop), which would establish a magnetic ﬁeld that would oppose the change in the source magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the direction of the induced
emf is opposite the direction of the source emf; this results in a gradual rather
than instantaneous increase in the source current to its ﬁnal equilibrium value.
This effect is called self-induction because the changing ﬂux through the circuit and
the resultant induced emf arise from the circuit itself. The emf L set up in this
case is called a self-induced emf. It is also often called a back emf.
As a second example of self-induction, consider Figure 32.2, which shows a
coil wound on a cylindrical iron core. (A practical device would have several hun-

Figure 32.1 After the switch is
thrown closed, the current produces a magnetic ﬂux through the
area enclosed by the loop. As the
current increases toward its equilibrium value, this magnetic ﬂux
changes in time and induces an
emf in the loop. The battery symbol drawn with dashed lines represents the self-induced emf.

Henry, an American physicist, became the ﬁrst director of the Smithsonian Institution and ﬁrst president
of the Academy of Natural Science.
He improved the design of the electromagnet and constructed one of the
ﬁrst motors. He also discovered the
phenomenon of self-induction but
failed to publish his ﬁndings. The unit
of inductance, the henry, is named in
his honor. (North Wind Picture

dred turns.) Assume that the source current in the coil either increases or decreases with time. When the source current is in the direction shown, a magnetic
ﬁeld directed from right to left is set up inside the coil, as seen in Figure 32.2a. As
the source current changes with time, the magnetic ﬂux through the coil also
changes and induces an emf in the coil. From Lenz’s law, the polarity of this induced emf must be such that it opposes the change in the magnetic ﬁeld from the
source current. If the source current is increasing, the polarity of the induced emf
is as pictured in Figure 32.2b, and if the source current is decreasing, the polarity
of the induced emf is as shown in Figure 32.2c.
To obtain a quantitative description of self-induction, we recall from Faraday’s
law that the induced emf is equal to the negative time rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux. The magnetic ﬂux is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld due to the
source current, which in turn is proportional to the source current in the circuit.
Therefore, a self-induced emf L is always proportional to the time rate of
change of the source current. For a closely spaced coil of N turns (a toroid or an
ideal solenoid) carrying a source current I, we ﬁnd that

That the inductance of a device depends on its geometry is analogous to the

which inductances are easily evaluated.

Answer The inductance would increase. For a given current, the magnetic ﬂux is now much greater because of the
increase in the ﬁeld originating from the magnetization of
the ferromagnetic material. For example, if the material has a
magnetic permeability of 500␮0 , the inductance would increase by a factor of 500.
The fact that various materials in the vicinity of a coil can
substantially alter the coil’s inductance is used to great advantage by trafﬁc engineers. A ﬂat, horizontal coil made of numerous loops of wire is placed in a shallow groove cut into
the pavement of the lane approaching an intersection. (See
the photograph at the beginning of this chapter.) These
loops are attached to circuitry that measures inductance.
When an automobile passes over the loops, the change in inductance caused by the large amount of iron passing over the
loops is used to control the lights at the intersection.

RL CIRCUITS

If a circuit contains a coil, such as a solenoid, the self-inductance of the coil prevents the current in the circuit from increasing or decreasing instantaneously. A
circuit element that has a large self-inductance is called an inductor and has the
circuit symbol
. We always assume that the self-inductance of the remainder of a circuit is negligible compared with that of the inductor. Keep in
mind, however, that even a circuit without a coil has some self-inductance that can
affect the behavior of the circuit.
Because the inductance of the inductor results in a back emf, an inductor in
a circuit opposes changes in the current through that circuit. If the battery
voltage in the circuit is increased so that the current rises, the inductor opposes

13.6

1018

CHAPTER 32

Inductance

this change, and the rise is not instantaneous. If the battery voltage is decreased,
the presence of the inductor results in a slow drop in the current rather than an
immediate drop. Thus, the inductor causes the circuit to be “sluggish” as it reacts
to changes in the voltage.

Because the current is increasing, dI/dt is positive; thus, L is negative. This negative value reﬂects the decrease in electric potential that occurs in going from a to b
across the inductor, as indicated by the positive and negative signs in Figure 32.3.
With this in mind, we can apply Kirchhoff’s loop rule to this circuit, traversing

where IR is the voltage drop across the resistor. (We developed Kirchhoff’s rules
for circuits with steady currents, but we can apply them to a circuit in which the
current is changing if we imagine them to represent the circuit at one instant of
time.) We must now look for a solution to this differential equation, which is similar to that for the RC circuit (see Section 28.4).
A mathematical solution of Equation 32.6 represents the current in the circuit
as a function of time. To ﬁnd this solution, we change variables for convenience,

This expression shows the effect of the inductor. The current does not increase instantly to its ﬁnal equilibrium value when the switch is closed but instead
increases according to an exponential function. If we remove the inductance in
the circuit, which we can do by letting L approach zero, the exponential term becomes zero and we see that there is no time dependence of the current in this
case — the current increases instantaneously to its ﬁnal equilibrium value in the
absence of the inductance.
We can also write this expression as

time responses of various circuits.
Figure 32.4 shows a graph of the current versus time in the RL circuit. Note
that the equilibrium value of the current, which occurs as t approaches inﬁnity, is
/R. We can see this by setting dI/dt equal to zero in Equation 32.6 and solving for
the current I. (At equilibrium, the change in the current is zero.) Thus, we see
that the current initially increases very rapidly and then gradually approaches the
equilibrium value /R as t approaches inﬁnity.
Let us also investigate the time rate of change of the current in the circuit.

(Fig. 32.5).
Now let us consider the RL circuit shown in Figure 32.6. The circuit contains
two switches that operate such that when one is closed, the other is opened. Suppose that S1 has been closed for a length of time sufﬁcient to allow the current to
reach its equilibrium value /R. In this situation, the circuit is described completely by the outer loop in Figure 32.6. If S2 is closed at the instant at which S1 is
opened, the circuit changes so that it is described completely by just the upper
loop in Figure 32.6. The lower loop no longer inﬂuences the behavior of the circuit. Thus, we have a circuit with no battery ( ⫽ 0). If we apply Kirchhoff’s loop
rule to the upper loop at the instant the switches are thrown, we obtain

Solution At the instant the switch is closed, there is no

At this instant, the battery voltage appears entirely across the
inductor in the form of a back emf of 12.0 V as the inductor
tries to maintain the zero-current condition. (The left end of
the inductor is at a higher electric potential than the right
end.) As time passes, the emf across the inductor decreases
and the current through the resistor (and hence the potential difference across it) increases. The sum of the two potential differences at all times is 12.0 V, as shown in Figure 32.10.

Because the emf induced in an inductor prevents a battery from establishing an instantaneous current, the battery must do work against the inductor to create a current. Part of the energy supplied by the battery appears as internal energy in the

This expression indicates that the rate at which energy is supplied by the battery

and the rate at which energy is stored in the inductor, LI(dI /dt). Thus, Equation

required to establish a ﬁeld.
We can also determine the energy density of a magnetic ﬁeld. For simplicity,
consider a solenoid whose inductance is given by Equation 32.5:

The Coaxial Cable

Coaxial cables are often used to connect electrical devices,
such as your stereo system and a loudspeaker. Model a long
coaxial cable as consisting of two thin concentric cylindrical
conducting shells of radii a and b and length , as shown in
Figure 32.11. The conducting shells carry the same current I
in opposite directions. Imagine that the inner conductor carries current to a device and that the outer one acts as a return
path carrying the current back to the source. (a) Calculate
the self-inductance L of this cable.

Solution

To obtain L, we must know the magnetic ﬂux
through any cross-section in the region between the two
shells, such as the light blue rectangle in Figure 32.11. AmI

père’s law (see Section 30.3) tells us that the magnetic ﬁeld in
the region between the shells is B ⫽ ␮ 0I/2␲r, where r is measured from the common center of the shells. The magnetic
ﬁeld is zero outside the outer shell (r ⬎ b) because the net
current through the area enclosed by a circular path surrounding the cable is zero, and hence from Ampère’s law,
冖 B ⴢ d s ⫽ 0. The magnetic ﬁeld is zero inside the inner shell
because the shell is hollow and no current is present within a
radius r ⬍ a.
The magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the light blue rectangle of length  and width b ⫺ a, the cross-section of interest. Because the magnetic ﬁeld varies with radial position
across this rectangle, we must use calculus to ﬁnd the total
magnetic ﬂux. Dividing this rectangle into strips of width dr,
such as the dark blue strip in Figure 32.11, we see that the
area of each strip is dr and that the ﬂux through each strip is

MUTUAL INDUCTANCE

Very often, the magnetic ﬂux through the area enclosed by a circuit varies with
time because of time-varying currents in nearby circuits. This condition induces an
emf through a process known as mutual induction, so called because it depends on
the interaction of two circuits.
Consider the two closely wound coils of wire shown in cross-sectional view in
Figure 32.12. The current I 1 in coil 1, which has N1 turns, creates magnetic ﬁeld
lines, some of which pass through coil 2, which has N 2 turns. The magnetic ﬂux
caused by the current in coil 1 and passing through coil 2 is represented by ⌽1 2 .
In analogy to Equation 32.2, we deﬁne the mutual inductance M12 of coil 2 with
respect to coil 1:

of both circuits and on their orientation with respect to each other. As the circuit
separation distance increases, the mutual inductance decreases because the ﬂux
linking the circuits decreases.

OSCILLATIONS IN AN LC CIRCUIT

When a capacitor is connected to an inductor as illustrated in Figure 32.14, the
combination is an LC circuit. If the capacitor is initially charged and the switch is
then closed, both the current in the circuit and the charge on the capacitor oscillate between maximum positive and negative values. If the resistance of the circuit
is zero, no energy is transformed to internal energy. In the following analysis, we
neglect the resistance in the circuit. We also assume an idealized situation in which
energy is not radiated away from the circuit. We shall discuss this radiation in
Chapter 34, but we neglect it for now. With these idealizations — zero resistance
and no radiation — the oscillations in the circuit persist indeﬁnitely.
Assume that the capacitor has an initial charge Q max (the maximum charge)
and that the switch is thrown closed at t ⫽ 0. Let us look at what happens from an
energy viewpoint.
When the capacitor is fully charged, the energy U in the circuit is stored in the
electric ﬁeld of the capacitor and is equal to Q 2max /2C (Eq. 26.11). At this time,
the current in the circuit is zero, and thus no energy is stored in the inductor. After the switch is thrown closed, the rate at which charges leave or enter the capacitor plates (which is also the rate at which the charge on the capacitor changes) is
equal to the current in the circuit. As the capacitor begins to discharge after the
switch is closed, the energy stored in its electric ﬁeld decreases. The discharge of
the capacitor represents a current in the circuit, and hence some energy is now
stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor. Thus, energy is transferred from the
electric ﬁeld of the capacitor to the magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor. When the capacitor is fully discharged, it stores no energy. At this time, the current reaches its
maximum value, and all of the energy is stored in the inductor. The current continues in the same direction, decreasing in magnitude, with the capacitor eventually becoming fully charged again but with the polarity of its plates now opposite
the initial polarity. This is followed by another discharge until the circuit returns to
its original state of maximum charge Q max and the plate polarity shown in Figure
32.14. The energy continues to oscillate between inductor and capacitor.
The oscillations of the LC circuit are an electromagnetic analog to the mechanical oscillations of a block – spring system, which we studied in Chapter 13.
Much of what we discussed is applicable to LC oscillations. For example, we investigated the effect of driving a mechanical oscillator with an external force, which
leads to the phenomenon of resonance. We observe the same phenomenon in the
LC circuit. For example, a radio tuner has an LC circuit with a natural frequency,
which we determine as follows: When the circuit is driven by the electromagnetic
oscillations of a radio signal detected by the antenna, the tuner circuit responds
with a large amplitude of electrical oscillation only for the station frequency that
matches the natural frequency. Thus, only the signal from one station is passed on
to the ampliﬁer, even though signals from all stations are driving the circuit at the
same time. When you turn the knob on the radio tuner to change the station, you
are changing the natural frequency of the circuit so that it will exhibit a resonance
response to a different driving frequency.
A graphical description of the energy transfer between the inductor and the
capacitor in an LC circuit is shown in Figure 32.15. The right side of the ﬁgure
shows the analogous energy transfer in the oscillating block – spring system studied
in Chapter 13. In each case, the situation is shown at intervals of one-fourth the
period of oscillation T. The potential energy 12 kx 2 stored in a stretched spring is
analogous to the electric potential energy Q 2max /2C stored in the capacitor. The
kinetic energy 12 mv 2 of the moving block is analogous to the magnetic energy 12 LI 2

32.15a, all of the energy is stored as electric potential energy in the capacitor at
t ⫽ 0. In Figure 32.15b, which is one fourth of a period later, all of the energy is
stored as magnetic energy 21 LI 2max in the inductor, where I max is the maximum current in the circuit. In Figure 32.15c, the energy in the LC circuit is stored completely in the capacitor, with the polarity of the plates now opposite what it was in
Figure 32.15a. In parts d and e the system returns to the initial conﬁguration over
the second half of the cycle. At times other than those shown in the ﬁgure, part of
the energy is stored in the electric ﬁeld of the capacitor and part is stored in the
magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor. In the analogous mechanical oscillation, part of the
energy is potential energy in the spring and part is kinetic energy of the block.
Let us consider some arbitrary time t after the switch is closed, so that the capacitor has a charge Q ⬍ Q max and the current is I ⬍ I max . At this time, both elements store energy, but the sum of the two energies must equal the total initial energy U stored in the fully charged capacitor at t ⫽ 0:

Note that the angular frequency of the oscillations depends solely on the inductance and capacitance of the circuit. This is the natural frequency of oscillation of

This expression contains all of the features described qualitatively at the beginning
of this section. It shows that the energy of the LC circuit continuously oscillates between energy stored in the electric ﬁeld of the capacitor and energy stored in the
magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor. When the energy stored in the capacitor has its
maximum value Q 2max /2C , the energy stored in the inductor is zero. When the energy stored in the inductor has its maximum value 21 LI 2max , the energy stored in
the capacitor is zero.
Plots of the time variations of UC and UL are shown in Figure 32.17. The sum
U C ⫹ U L is a constant and equal to the total energy Q 2max /2C or LI 2max /2. Analytical veriﬁcation of this is straightforward. The amplitudes of the two graphs in Figure 32.17 must be equal because the maximum energy stored in the capacitor

In our idealized situation, the oscillations in the circuit persist indeﬁnitely;
however, we remember that the total energy U of the circuit remains constant only
if energy transfers and transformations are neglected. In actual circuits, there is
always some resistance, and hence energy is transformed to internal energy.
We mentioned at the beginning of this section that we are also ignoring radiation
from the circuit. In reality, radiation is inevitable in this type of circuit, and the total energy in the circuit continuously decreases as a result of this process.

THE RLC CIRCUIT

We now turn our attention to a more realistic circuit consisting of an inductor, a
capacitor, and a resistor connected in series, as shown in Figure 32.19. We let the
resistance of the resistor represent all of the resistance in the circuit. We assume
that the capacitor has an initial charge Q max before the switch is closed. Once the
switch is thrown closed and a current is established, the total energy stored in the
capacitor and inductor at any time is given, as before, by Equation 32.18. However,
the total energy is no longer constant, as it was in the LC circuit, because the resistor causes transformation to internal energy. Because the rate of energy transformation to internal energy within a resistor is I 2R, we have

Comparing Equations 32.29 and 32.30, we see that Q corresponds to the position x
of the block at any instant, L to the mass m of the block, R to the damping coefﬁcient b, and C to 1/k, where k is the force constant of the spring. These and other
relationships are listed in Table 32.1.
Because the analytical solution of Equation 32.29 is cumbersome, we give only
a qualitative description of the circuit behavior. In the simplest case, when R ⫽ 0,
Equation 32.29 reduces to that of a simple LC circuit, as expected, and the charge
and the current oscillate sinusoidally in time. This is equivalent to removal of all
damping in the mechanical oscillator.
When R is small, a situation analogous to light damping in the mechanical oscillator, the solution of Equation 32.29 is

that, when R V !4L/C (so that the second term in the brackets is much smaller
than the ﬁrst), the frequency ␻d of the damped oscillator is close to that of the undamped oscillator, 1/!LC. Because I ⫽ dQ /dt, it follows that the current also undergoes damped harmonic oscillation. A plot of the charge versus time for the
damped oscillator is shown in Figure 32.21a. Note that the maximum value of Q

When R exceeds R c , the system is said to be overdamped (Fig. 32.22).

consisting of just one thing: matter. In Henry’s experiment, after a battery is removed from a coil, the energy
that keeps the current ﬂowing for a while does not belong to any piece of matter. This energy belongs to the

73. To prevent damage from arcing in an electric motor, a
discharge resistor is sometimes placed in parallel with
the armature. If the motor is suddenly unplugged while
running, this resistor limits the voltage that appears
across the armature coils. Consider a 12.0-V dc motor
with an armature that has a resistance of 7.50 ⍀ and an
inductance of 450 mH. Assume that the back emf in the
armature coils is 10.0 V when the motor is running at
normal speed. (The equivalent circuit for the armature
is shown in Fig. P32.73.) Calculate the maximum resistance R that limits the voltage across the armature to

A fundamental property of a Type I superconducting

Meissner effect, illustrated in the photograph on page 855

superconducting material has B ⫽ 0 everywhere inside

throughout the interior of the sample. The following
problem will help you to understand the magnetic force
that can then act on the superconducting sample.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
32.1 When it is being opened. When the switch is initially
open, there is no current in the circuit; when the switch
is then closed, the inductor tends to maintain the nocurrent condition, and as a result there is very little
chance of sparking. When the switch is initially closed,
there is current in the circuit; when the switch is then
opened, the current decreases. An induced emf is set up
across the inductor, and this emf tends to maintain the
original current. Sparking can occur as the current
bridges the air gap between the poles of the switch.
32.2 (b). Figure 32.8 shows that circuit B has the greater time
constant because in this circuit it takes longer for the
current to reach its maximum value and then longer
for this current to decrease to zero after switch S 2 is
closed. Equation 32.8 indicates that, for equal resistances R A and R B , the condition ␶B ⬎ ␶A means that

Alternating-Current Circuits

I

n this chapter we describe alternating-current (ac) circuits. Every time we turn
on a television set, a stereo, or any of a multitude of other electrical appliances,
we are calling on alternating currents to provide the power to operate them. We
begin our study by investigating the characteristics of simple series circuits that contain resistors, inductors, and capacitors and that are driven by a sinusoidal voltage.
We shall ﬁnd that the maximum alternating current in each element is proportional
to the maximum alternating voltage across the element. We shall also ﬁnd that when
the applied voltage is sinusoidal, the current in each element is sinusoidal, too, but
not necessarily in phase with the applied voltage. We conclude the chapter with two
sections concerning transformers, power transmission, and RC ﬁlters.

33.1

AC SOURCES AND PHASORS

An ac circuit consists of circuit elements and a generator that provides the alternating current. As you recall from Section 31.5, the basic principle of the ac generator is a direct consequence of Faraday’s law of induction. When a conducting
loop is rotated in a magnetic ﬁeld at constant angular frequency , a sinusoidal
voltage (emf) is induced in the loop. This instantaneous voltage v is
v  V max sin t
where Vmax is the maximum output voltage of the ac generator, or the voltage
amplitude. From Equation 13.6, the angular frequency is

  2f 

2
T

where f is the frequency of the generator (the voltage source) and T is the period.
The generator determines the frequency of the current in any circuit connected to
the generator. Because the output voltage of an ac generator varies sinusoidally
with time, the voltage is positive during one half of the cycle and negative during
the other half. Likewise, the current in any circuit driven by an ac generator is an
alternating current that also varies sinusoidally with time. Commercial electricpower plants in the United States use a frequency of 60 Hz, which corresponds to
an angular frequency of 377 rad/s.
The primary aim of this chapter can be summarized as follows: If an ac generator is connected to a series circuit containing resistors, inductors, and capacitors,
we want to know the amplitude and time characteristics of the alternating current.
To simplify our analysis of circuits containing two or more elements, we use graphical constructions called phasor diagrams. In these constructions, alternating (sinusoidal) quantities, such as current and voltage, are represented by rotating vectors
called phasors. The length of the phasor represents the amplitude (maximum
value) of the quantity, and the projection of the phasor onto the vertical axis represents the instantaneous value of the quantity. As we shall see, a phasor diagram
greatly simpliﬁes matters when we must combine several sinusoidally varying currents or voltages that have different phases.

RESISTORS IN AN AC CIRCUIT

Maximum current in a resistor

From Equations 33.1 and 33.2, we see that the instantaneous voltage across the resistor is
v R  I max R sin t

(33.3)

Let us discuss the current-versus-time curve shown in Figure 33.2a. At point a,
the current has a maximum value in one direction, arbitrarily called the positive
direction. Between points a and b, the current is decreasing in magnitude but is
still in the positive direction. At b, the current is momentarily zero; it then begins
to increase in the negative direction between points b and c. At c, the current has
reached its maximum value in the negative direction.
The current and voltage are in step with each other because they vary identically with time. Because iR and vR both vary as sin  t and reach their maximum
values at the same time, as shown in Figure 33.2a, they are said to be in phase.
Thus we can say that, for a sinusoidal applied voltage, the current in a resistor is always in phase with the voltage across the resistor.
A phasor diagram is used to represent current – voltage phase relationships. The
lengths of the arrows correspond to Vmax and I max . The projections of the phasor
arrows onto the vertical axis give vR and iR values. As we showed in Section 13.5,
if the phasor arrow is imagined to rotate steadily with angular speed , its verticalaxis component oscillates sinusoidally in time. In the case of the single-loop resistive circuit of Figure 33.1, the current and voltage phasors lie along the same line,
as in Figure 33.2b, because iR and vR are in phase.
Note that the average value of the current over one cycle is zero. That is,
the current is maintained in the positive direction for the same amount of time
and at the same magnitude as it is maintained in the negative direction. However,
the direction of the current has no effect on the behavior of the resistor. We can
understand this by realizing that collisions between electrons and the ﬁxed atoms
of the resistor result in an increase in the temperature of the resistor. Although
this temperature increase depends on the magnitude of the current, it is independent of the direction of the current.
We can make this discussion quantitative by recalling that the rate at which
electrical energy is converted to internal energy in a resistor is the power ᏼ  i 2R,
where i is the instantaneous current in the resistor. Because this rate is proportional to the square of the current, it makes no difference whether the current is
direct or alternating — that is, whether the sign associated with the current is positive or negative. However, the temperature increase produced by an alternating

current having a maximum value I max is not the same as that produced by a direct
current equal to I max . This is because the alternating current is at this maximum
value for only an instant during each cycle (Fig. 33.3a). What is of importance in
an ac circuit is an average value of current, referred to as the rms current. As we
learned in Section 21.1, the notation rms stands for root mean square, which in this
case means the square root of the mean (average) value of the square of the current: I rms  √i 2. Because i 2 varies as sin2  t and because the average value of i 2 is

ᏼav  I 2rmsR
2 That the square root of the average value of i 2 is equal to I
max/√2 can be shown as follows: The current in the circuit varies with time according to the expression i  I max sin  t, so i 2 
I 2max sin2  t. Therefore, we can ﬁnd the average value of i 2 by calculating the average value of sin2  t. A
graph of cos2  t versus time is identical to a graph of sin2  t versus time, except that the points are
shifted on the time axis. Thus, the time average of sin2  t is equal to the time average of cos2  t when
taken over one or more complete cycles. That is,

(sin2  t)av  (cos2  t)av
Using this fact and the trigonometric identity sin2   cos2   1, we obtain
(sin2 t )av  (cos2 t )av  2(sin2 t )av  1
(sin2 t )av  12
When we substitute this result in the expression i 2  I 2max sin2 t, we obtain (i 2 )av  i 2  I 2rms 
I 2max/2, or I rms  I max/√2. The factor 1/√2 is valid only for sinusoidally varying currents. Other waveforms, such as sawtooth variations, have different factors.

When we speak of measuring a 120-V alternating voltage from an electrical
outlet, we are referring to an rms voltage of 120 V. A quick calculation using Equation 33.5 shows that such an alternating voltage has a maximum value of about
170 V. One reason we use rms values when discussing alternating currents and
voltages in this chapter is that ac ammeters and voltmeters are designed to read
rms values. Furthermore, with rms values, many of the equations we use have the
same form as their direct-current counterparts.

Comparing this result with Equation 33.6, we see that the instantaneous current i L
in the inductor and the instantaneous voltage v L across the inductor are out of
phase by (/2) rad  90°.
In general, inductors in an ac circuit produce a current that is out of phase
with the ac voltage. A plot of voltage and current versus time is provided in Figure
33.5a. At point a, the current begins to increase in the positive direction. At this instant the rate of change of current is at a maximum, and thus the voltage across
the inductor is also at a maximum. As the current increases between points a and
b, di/dt (the slope of the current curve) gradually decreases until it reaches zero at
point b. As a result, the voltage across the inductor is decreasing during this same
time interval, as the curve segment between c and d indicates. Immediately after
point b, the current begins to decrease, although it still has the same direction it
had during the previous quarter cycle (from a to b). As the current decreases to
zero (from b to e), a voltage is again induced in the inductor (d to f ), but the polarity of this voltage is opposite that of the voltage induced between c and d (because back emfs are always directed to oppose the change in the current). Note
that the voltage reaches its maximum value one quarter of a period before the current reaches its maximum value. Thus, we see that
for a sinusoidal applied voltage, the current in an inductor always lags behind
the voltage across the inductor by 90° (one-quarter cycle in time).

The current in an inductor lags
the voltage by 90°

We neglect the constant of integration here because it depends on the initial conditions, which are
not important for this situation.

Inductive reactance, like resistance, has units of ohms. However, unlike resistance, reactance depends on frequency as well as on the characteristics of the inductor. Note that the reactance of an inductor in an ac circuit increases as the frequency of the current increases. This is because at higher frequencies, the
instantaneous current must change more rapidly than it does at the lower frequencies; this causes an increase in the maximum induced emf associated with a given
maximum current.
Using Equations 33.6 and 33.9, we ﬁnd that the instantaneous voltage across
the inductor is

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 33.2
Figure 33.6 shows a circuit consisting of a series combination
of an alternating voltage source, a switch, an inductor, and a
lightbulb. The switch is thrown closed, and the circuit is allowed to come to equilibrium so that the lightbulb glows
steadily. An iron rod is then inserted into the interior of the
inductor. What happens to the brightness of the lightbulb,

to dim the lights in the theater gradually.

Solution

The bulb gets dimmer. As the rod is inserted, the
inductance increases because the magnetic ﬁeld inside the
inductor increases. According to Equation 33.10, this increase in L means that the inductive reactance of the inductor also increases. The voltage across the inductor increases
while the voltage across the lightbulb decreases. With less

Comparing this expression with Equation 33.12, we see that the current is /2
rad  90° out of phase with the voltage across the capacitor. A plot of current and
voltage versus time (Fig. 33.8a) shows that the current reaches its maximum value
one quarter of a cycle sooner than the voltage reaches its maximum value.
Looking more closely, we see that the segment of the current curve from a to b
indicates that the current starts out at a relatively high value. We can understand
this by recognizing that there is no charge on the capacitor at t  0; as a consequence, nothing in the circuit except the resistance of the wires can hinder the
ﬂow of charge at this instant. However, the current decreases as the voltage across
the capacitor increases (from c to d on the voltage curve), and the capacitor is
charging. When the voltage is at point d, the current reverses and begins to increase in the opposite direction (from b to e on the current curve). During this
time, the voltage across the capacitor decreases from d to f because the plates are
now losing the charge they accumulated earlier. During the second half of the cycle, the current is initially at its maximum value in the opposite direction (point e)
and then decreases as the voltage across the capacitor builds up. The phasor diagram in Figure 33.8b also shows that
for a sinusoidally applied voltage, the current in a capacitor always leads the
voltage across the capacitor by 90°.

v C  V max sin t  I maxX C sin t

(33.18)

Equations 33.16 and 33.17 indicate that as the frequency of the voltage source increases, the capacitive reactance decreases and therefore the maximum current increases. Again, note that the frequency of the current is determined by the frequency of the voltage source driving the circuit. As the frequency approaches zero,
the capacitive reactance approaches inﬁnity, and hence the current approaches
zero. This makes sense because the circuit approaches direct-current conditions as
 approaches 0.

is to determine and I max . Figure 33.9b shows the voltage versus time across each
element in the circuit and their phase relationships.
To solve this problem, we must analyze the phasor diagram for this circuit.
First, we note that because the elements are in series, the current everywhere in
the circuit must be the same at any instant. That is, the current at all points in a
series ac circuit has the same amplitude and phase. Therefore, as we found in
the preceding sections, the voltage across each element has a different amplitude
and phase, as summarized in Figure 33.10. In particular, the voltage across the resistor is in phase with the current, the voltage across the inductor leads the current
by 90°, and the voltage across the capacitor lags behind the current by 90°. Using
these phase relationships, we can express the instantaneous voltages across the
three elements as

For the circuit of Figure 33.9a, is the voltage of the ac source equal to (a) the sum of the
maximum voltages across the elements, (b) the sum of the instantaneous voltages across
the elements, or (c) the sum of the rms voltages across the elements?

Although this analytical approach is correct, it is simpler to obtain the sum by examining the phasor diagram. Because the current at any instant is the same in all

elements, we can obtain a phasor diagram for the circuit. We combine the three
phasor pairs shown in Figure 33.10 to obtain Figure 33.11a, in which a single phasor I max is used to represent the current in each element. To obtain the vector sum
of the three voltage phasors in Figure 33.11a, we redraw the phasor diagram as in
Figure 33.11b. From this diagram, we see that the vector sum of the voltage amplitudes VR , VL , and VC equals a phasor whose length is the maximum applied
voltage V max , where the phasor V max makes an angle with the current phasor
I max . Note that the voltage phasors VL and VC are in opposite directions along
the same line, and hence we can construct the difference phasor V L  V C ,
which is perpendicular to the phasor VR . From either one of the right triangles
in Figure 33.11b, we see that

We can regard Equation 33.24 as the ac equivalent of Equation 27.8, which deﬁned resistance in a dc circuit as the ratio of the voltage across a conductor to the
current in that conductor. Note that the impedance and therefore the current in
an ac circuit depend upon the resistance, the inductance, the capacitance, and the
frequency (because the reactances are frequency-dependent).
By removing the common factor I max from each phasor in Figure 33.11a, we
can construct the impedance triangle shown in Figure 33.12. From this phasor diagram we ﬁnd that the phase angle between the current and the voltage is

the phase angle is zero. In this case, the impedance equals the resistance and
the current has its maximum value, given by V max /R. The frequency at which
this occurs is called the resonance frequency; it is described further in

POWER IN AN AC CIRCUIT

No power losses are associated with pure capacitors and pure inductors in
an ac circuit. To see why this is true, let us ﬁrst analyze the power in an ac circuit
containing only a generator and a capacitor.
When the current begins to increase in one direction in an ac circuit, charge
begins to accumulate on the capacitor, and a voltage drop appears across it. When
this voltage drop reaches its maximum value, the energy stored in the capacitor is
1
2
2 C(V max ) . However, this energy storage is only momentary. The capacitor is
charged and discharged twice during each cycle: Charge is delivered to the capacitor
during two quarters of the cycle and is returned to the voltage source during the remaining two quarters. Therefore, the average power supplied by the source is
zero. In other words, no power losses occur in a capacitor in an ac circuit.
Similarly, the voltage source must do work against the back emf of the inductor. When the current reaches its maximum value, the energy stored in the inductor is a maximum and is given by 12 LI 2max . When the current begins to decrease in
the circuit, this stored energy is returned to the source as the inductor attempts to
maintain the current in the circuit.
In Example 28.1 we found that the power delivered by a battery to a dc circuit
is equal to the product of the current and the emf of the battery. Likewise, the instantaneous power delivered by an ac generator to a circuit is the product of the
generator current and the applied voltage. For the RLC circuit shown in Figure
33.9a, we can express the instantaneous power ᏼ as
ᏼ  i v  I max sin(t  )V max sin t
 I max V max sin t sin(t  )

(33.26)

Clearly, this result is a complicated function of time and therefore is not very useful from a practical viewpoint. What is generally of interest is the average power
over one or more cycles. Such an average can be computed by ﬁrst using the
trigonometric identity sin( t  )  sin  t cos  cos  t sin . Substituting this
into Equation 33.26 gives
ᏼ  I max V max sin2 t cos

 I max V max sin t cos t sin

(33.27)

We now take the time average of ᏼ over one or more cycles, noting that I max ,
Vmax , , and  are all constants. The time average of the ﬁrst term on the right
in Equation 33.27 involves the average value of sin2  t, which is 21 (as shown in
footnote 2). The time average of the second term on the right is identically zero
because sin  t cos  t  12 sin 2 t, and the average value of sin 2 t is zero. Therefore, we can express the average power ᏼav as
ᏼav  12 I max V max cos

(33.28)

It is convenient to express the average power in terms of the rms current and
rms voltage deﬁned by Equations 33.4 and 33.5:

In words, the average power delivered by the generator is converted to internal energy in the resistor, just as in the case of a dc circuit. No power loss occurs in an ideal inductor or capacitor. When the load is purely resistive, then
 0, cos  1, and from Equation 33.29 we see that
ᏼav  I rms V rms
Equation 33.29 shows that the power delivered by an ac source to any circuit
depends on the phase, and this result has many interesting applications. For example, a factory that uses large motors in machines, generators, or transformers has a
large inductive load (because of all the windings). To deliver greater power to
such devices in the factory without using excessively high voltages, technicians introduce capacitance in the circuits to shift the phase.

Alternating-Current Circuits

Because the impedance depends on the frequency of the source, the current in
the RLC circuit also depends on the frequency. The frequency  0 at which
X L  X C  0 is called the resonance frequency of the circuit. To ﬁnd  0 , we use
the condition X L  X C , from which we obtain  0L  1/ 0C , or

Note that this frequency also corresponds to the natural frequency of oscillation of
an LC circuit (see Section 32.5). Therefore, the current in a series RLC circuit
reaches its maximum value when the frequency of the applied voltage matches the
natural oscillator frequency — which depends only on L and C. Furthermore, at
this frequency the current is in phase with the applied voltage.

Quick Quiz 33.4
What is the impedance of a series RLC circuit at resonance? What is the current in the circuit at resonance?

A plot of rms current versus frequency for a series RLC circuit is shown in Figure 33.15a. The data assume a constant V rms  5.0 mV, that L  5.0 H, and
that C  2.0 nF. The three curves correspond to three values of R. Note that in
each case the current reaches its maximum value at the resonance frequency  0 .
Furthermore, the curves become narrower and taller as the resistance decreases.
By inspecting Equation 33.32, we must conclude that, when R  0, the current
becomes inﬁnite at resonance. Although the equation predicts this, real circuits always have some resistance, which limits the value of the current.

33.7 Resonance in a Series RLC Circuit

It is also interesting to calculate the average power as a function of frequency
for a series RLC circuit. Using Equations 33.30, 33.31, and 33.23, we ﬁnd that

Average power as a function of
frequency in an RLC circuit

This expression shows that at resonance, when    0 , the average power is a
maximum and has the value (Vrms )2/R. Figure 33.15b is a plot of average power
versus frequency for two values of R in a series RLC circuit. As the resistance is
made smaller, the curve becomes sharper in the vicinity of the resonance frequency. This curve sharpness is usually described by a dimensionless parameter
known as the quality factor, denoted by Q:4
Q

Quality factor

where  is the width of the curve measured between the two values of  for
which ᏼav has half its maximum value, called the half-power points (see Fig. 33.15b.)
It is left as a problem (Problem 70) to show that the width at the half-power points
has the value   R/L, so

(33.36)

The curves plotted in Figure 33.16 show that a high-Q circuit responds to only
a very narrow range of frequencies, whereas a low-Q circuit can detect a much
broader range of frequencies. Typical values of Q in electronic circuits range from
10 to 100.
The receiving circuit of a radio is an important application of a resonant circuit. One tunes the radio to a particular station (which transmits a speciﬁc electromagnetic wave or signal) by varying a capacitor, which changes the resonant frequency of the receiving circuit. When the resonance frequency of the circuit
matches that of the incoming electromagnetic wave, the current in the receiving
circuit increases. This signal caused by the incoming wave is then ampliﬁed and
fed to a speaker. Because many signals are often present over a range of frequencies, it is important to design a high-Q circuit to eliminate unwanted signals. In
this manner, stations whose frequencies are near but not equal to the resonance
frequency give signals at the receiver that are negligibly small relative to the signal
that matches the resonance frequency.

The quality factor is also deﬁned as the ratio 2E/E, where E is the energy stored in the oscillating
system and E is the energy lost per cycle of oscillation. The quality factor for a mechanical system can
also be deﬁned, as noted in Section 13.7.

Quick Quiz 33.5
An airport metal detector (Fig. 33.17) is essentially a resonant circuit. The portal you step
through is an inductor (a large loop of conducting wire) that is part of the circuit. The frequency of the circuit is tuned to the resonant frequency of the circuit when there is no
metal in the inductor. Any metal on your body increases the effective inductance of the
loop and changes the current in it. If you want the detector to be able to detect a small
metallic object, should the circuit have a high quality factor or a low one?

THE TRANSFORMER AND POWER TRANSMISSION

When electric power is transmitted over great distances, it is economical to use a
high voltage and a low current to minimize the I 2R loss in the transmission lines.

1061

33.8 The Transformer and Power Transmission

Consequently, 350-kV lines are common, and in many areas even higher-voltage
(765-kV) lines are under construction. At the receiving end of such lines, the consumer requires power at a low voltage (for safety and for efﬁciency in design).
Therefore, a device is required that can change the alternating voltage and current without causing appreciable changes in the power delivered. The ac transformer is that device.
In its simplest form, the ac transformer consists of two coils of wire wound
around a core of iron, as illustrated in Figure 33.18. The coil on the left, which is
connected to the input alternating voltage source and has N1 turns, is called the
primary winding (or the primary). The coil on the right, consisting of N 2 turns and
connected to a load resistor R , is called the secondary winding (or the secondary).
The purpose of the iron core is to increase the magnetic ﬂux through the coil
and to provide a medium in which nearly all the ﬂux through one coil passes
through the other coil. Eddy current losses are reduced by using a laminated
core. Iron is used as the core material because it is a soft ferromagnetic substance
and hence reduces hysteresis losses. Transformation of energy to internal energy
in the ﬁnite resistance of the coil wires is usually quite small. Typical transformers
have power efﬁciencies from 90% to 99%. In the discussion that follows, we assume an ideal transformer, one in which the energy losses in the windings and core
are zero.
First, let us consider what happens in the primary circuit when the switch in
the secondary circuit is open. If we assume that the resistance of the primary is
negligible relative to its inductive reactance, then the primary circuit is equivalent
to a simple circuit consisting of an inductor connected to an ac generator. Because
the current is 90° out of phase with the voltage, the power factor cos is zero, and
hence the average power delivered from the generator to the primary circuit is
zero. Faraday’s law states that the voltage V1 across the primary is

An ideal transformer consists of two coils wound
on the same iron core. An alternating voltage V1 is applied to the
primary coil, and the output voltage V2 is across the resistor of resistance R.

(33.37)

where B is the magnetic ﬂux through each turn. If we assume that all magnetic
ﬁeld lines remain within the iron core, the ﬂux through each turn of the primary
equals the ﬂux through each turn of the secondary. Hence, the voltage across the
secondary is
V 2  N 2

dB

Solving Equation 33.37 for dB /dt and substituting the result into Equation 33.38,
we ﬁnd that
V 2 

N2
V 1
N1

(33.39)

When N 2  N 1 , the output voltage V 2 exceeds the input voltage V 1 . This setup
is referred to as a step-up transformer. When N 2  N 1 , the output voltage is less than
the input voltage, and we have a step-down transformer.
When the switch in the secondary circuit is thrown closed, a current I 2 is induced in the secondary. If the load in the secondary circuit is a pure resistance,
the induced current is in phase with the induced voltage. The power supplied to
the secondary circuit must be provided by the ac generator connected to the primary circuit, as shown in Figure 33.19. In an ideal transformer, where there are no
losses, the power I 1 V1 supplied by the generator is equal to the power I 2 V 2 in

This cylindrical step-down transformer drops the voltage from
4 000 V to 220 V for delivery to a
group of residences. (George Semple)

is the equivalent resistance of the load resistance when viewed from the primary
side. From this analysis we see that a transformer may be used to match resistances
between the primary circuit and the load. In this manner, maximum power transfer can be achieved between a given power source and the load resistance. For example, a transformer connected between the 1-k output of an audio ampliﬁer
and an 8- speaker ensures that as much of the audio signal as possible is transferred into the speaker. In stereo terminology, this is called impedance matching.
We can now also understand why transformers are useful for transmitting
power over long distances. Because the generator voltage is stepped up, the current in the transmission line is reduced, and hence I 2R losses are reduced. In
practice, the voltage is stepped up to around 230 000 V at the generating station,
stepped down to around 20 000 V at a distributing station, then to 4 000 V for delivery to residential areas, and ﬁnally to 120 – 240 V at the customer’s site. The
power is supplied by a three-wire cable. In the United States, two of these wires are
“hot,” with voltages of 120 V with respect to a common ground wire. Home appliances operating on 120 V are connected in parallel between one of the hot wires
and ground. Larger appliances, such as electric stoves and clothes dryers, require
240 V. This is obtained across the two hot wires, which are 180° out of phase so
that the voltage difference between them is 240 V.
There is a practical upper limit to the voltages that can be used in transmission lines. Excessive voltages could ionize the air surrounding the transmission
lines, which could result in a conducting path to ground or to other objects in the
vicinity. This, of course, would present a serious hazard to any living creatures. For
this reason, a long string of insulators is used to keep high-voltage wires away from
their supporting metal towers. Other insulators are used to maintain separation
between wires.

Nikola Tesla

(1856 – 1943) Tesla
was born in Croatia but spent most of
his professional life as an inventor in
the United States. He was a key ﬁgure
in the development of alternatingcurrent electricity, high-voltage transformers, and the transport of electric
power via ac transmission lines.
Tesla’s viewpoint was at odds with
the ideas of Thomas Edison, who
committed himself to the use of direct
current in power transmission. Tesla’s
ac approach won out. (UPI/Bettmann)

Figure 33.20

The primary winding in
this transformer is directly attached to the
prongs of the plug. The secondary winding
is connected to the wire on the right, which
runs to an electronic device. Many of these
power-supply transformers also convert alternating current to direct current. (George

Semple)

33.9 Rectifiers and Filters

Many common household electronic devices require low voltages to operate
properly. A small transformer that plugs directly into the wall, like the one illustrated in the photograph at the beginning of this chapter, can provide the proper
voltage. Figure 33.20 shows the two windings wrapped around a common iron
core that is found inside all these little “black boxes.” This particular transformer
converts the 120-V ac in the wall socket to 12.5-V ac. (Can you determine the ratio
of the numbers of turns in the two coils?) Some black boxes also make use of
diodes to convert the alternating current to direct current (see Section 33.9).

The Economics of ac Power

An electricity-generating station needs to deliver 20 MW of
power to a city 1.0 km away. (a) If the resistance of the wires
is 2.0
and the electricity costs about 10¢/kWh, estimate
what it costs the utility company to send the power to the city
for one day. A common voltage for commercial power generators is 22 kV, but a step-up transformer is used to boost the
voltage to 230 kV before transmission.

Solution The power losses in the transmission line are the
result of the resistance of the line. We can determine the loss
from Equation 27.23, ᏼ  I 2R . Because this is an estimate,
we can use dc equations and calculate I from Equation 27.22:

RECTIFIERS AND FILTERS

Portable electronic devices such as radios and compact disc (CD) players are often
powered by direct current supplied by batteries. Many devices come with ac – dc
converters that provide a readily available direct-current source if the batteries
are low. Such a converter contains a transformer that steps the voltage down from
120 V to typically 9 V and a circuit that converts alternating current to direct current. The process of converting alternating current to direct current is called rectiﬁcation, and the converting device is called a rectiﬁer.
The most important element in a rectiﬁer circuit is a diode, a circuit element
that conducts current in one direction but not the other. Most diodes used in
modern electronics are semiconductor devices. The circuit symbol for a diode is
, where the arrow indicates the direction of the current through the
diode. A diode has low resistance to current in one direction (the direction of the
arrow) and high resistance to current in the opposite direction. We can understand how a diode rectiﬁes a current by considering Figure 33.21a, which shows a

1064

CHAPTER 33

Alternating-Current Circuits

diode and a resistor connected to the secondary of a transformer. The transformer
reduces the voltage from 120-V ac to the lower voltage that is needed for the device having a resistance R (the load resistance). Because current can pass through
the diode in only one direction, the alternating current in the load resistor is reduced to the form shown by the solid curve in Figure 33.21b. The diode conducts
current only when the side of the symbol containing the arrowhead has a positive
potential relative to the other side. In this situation, the diode acts as a half-wave
rectiﬁer because current is present in the circuit during only half of each cycle.
When a capacitor is added to the circuit, as shown by the dashed lines and the
capacitor symbol in Figure 33.21a, the circuit is a simple dc power supply. The
time variation in the current in the load resistor (the dashed curve in Fig. 33.21b)
is close to being zero, as determined by the RC time constant of the circuit.
The RC circuit in Figure 33.21a is one example of a ﬁlter circuit, which is
used to smooth out or eliminate a time-varying signal. For example, radios are usually powered by a 60-Hz alternating voltage. After rectiﬁcation, the voltage still
contains a small ac component at 60 Hz (sometimes called ripple), which must be
ﬁltered. By “ﬁltered,” we mean that the 60-Hz ripple must be reduced to a value
much less than that of the audio signal to be ampliﬁed, because without ﬁltering,
the resulting audio signal includes an annoying hum at 60 Hz.
To understand how a ﬁlter works, let us consider the simple series RC circuit
shown in Figure 33.22a. The input voltage is across the two elements and is represented by V max sin t. Because we are interested only in maximum values, we can
use Equation 33.24, taking X L  0 and substituting X C  1/C. This shows that
the maximum input voltage is related to the maximum current by
V in  I maxZ  I max

A plot of this ratio as a function of angular frequency (see Fig. 33.22b) shows
that at low frequencies Vout is much smaller than Vin , whereas at high frequencies the two voltages are equal. Because the circuit preferentially passes signals of
higher frequency while blocking low-frequency signals, the circuit is called an RC
high-pass ﬁlter. Physically, a high-pass ﬁlter works because a capacitor “blocks out”
direct current and ac current at low frequencies.
Now let us consider the circuit shown in Figure 33.23a, where the output voltage is taken across the capacitor. In this case, the maximum voltage equals the voltage across the capacitor. Because the impedance across the capacitor is

This ratio, plotted as a function of  in Figure 33.23b, shows that in this case the
circuit preferentially passes signals of low frequency. Hence, the circuit is called an
RC low-pass ﬁlter.
You may be familiar with crossover networks, which are an important part of
the speaker systems for high-ﬁdelity audio systems. These networks utilize low-pass
ﬁlters to direct low frequencies to a special type of speaker, the “woofer,” which is
designed to reproduce the low notes accurately. The high frequencies are sent to
the “tweeter” speaker.

(woofers) and small loudspeakers (tweeters). (a) What circuit element would you place in
series with a woofer, which passes low-frequency signals? (b) What circuit element would
you place in series with a tweeter, which passes high-frequency signals?

SUMMARY
If an ac circuit consists of a generator and a resistor, the current is in phase with
the voltage. That is, the current and voltage reach their maximum values at the
same time.
The rms current and rms voltage in an ac circuit in which the voltages and
current vary sinusoidally are given by the expressions
I rms 
V rms 

I max

 0.707I max

V max

√2

 0.707V max

(33.4)
(33.5)

where I max and Vmax are the maximum values.
If an ac circuit consists of a generator and an inductor, the current lags behind
the voltage by 90°. That is, the voltage reaches its maximum value one quarter of a
period before the current reaches its maximum value.
If an ac circuit consists of a generator and a capacitor, the current leads the
voltage by 90°. That is, the current reaches its maximum value one quarter of a period before the voltage reaches its maximum value.
In ac circuits that contain inductors and capacitors, it is useful to deﬁne the
inductive reactance XL and the capacitive reactance XC as
X L  L

where  is the angular frequency of the ac generator. The SI unit of reactance is
the ohm.

The impedance Z of an RLC series ac circuit, which also has the ohm as its
unit, is
(33.23)
Z ⬅ √R 2  (X L  X C )2
This expression illustrates that we cannot simply add the resistance and reactances
in a circuit. We must account for the fact that the applied voltage and current are
out of phase, with the phase angle between the current and voltage being

The sign of can be positive or negative, depending on whether XL is greater or
less than XC . The phase angle is zero when X L  X C .
The average power delivered by the generator in an RLC ac circuit is
ᏼav  I rms V rms cos

(33.29)

An equivalent expression for the average power is
ᏼav  I 2rms R

(33.30)

The average power delivered by the generator results in increasing internal energy
in the resistor. No power loss occurs in an ideal inductor or capacitor.

A series RLC circuit is in resonance when the inductive reactance equals the
capacitive reactance. When this condition is met, the current given by Equation
33.32 reaches its maximum value. When X L  X C in a circuit, the resonance frequency  0 of the circuit is
1
0 
(33.33)
√LC
The current in a series RLC circuit reaches its maximum value when the frequency
of the generator equals  0 — that is, when the “driving” frequency matches the resonance frequency.
Transformers allow for easy changes in alternating voltage. Because energy
(and therefore power) are conserved, we can write
I 1 V 1  I 2 V 2

(33.40)

to relate the currents and voltages in the primary and secondary windings of a
transformer.

33.1 (c) ᏼav  0 and i av  0. The average power is proportional to the rms current — which, as Figure 33.3 shows,
is nonzero even though the average current is zero.
Condition (a) is valid only for an open circuit, and conditions (b) and (d) can never be true because i av  0
for ac circuits even though i rms  0.
33.2 (b) Sum of instantaneous voltages across elements.
Choices (a) and (c) are incorrect because the unaligned
sine curves in Figure 33.9b mean that the voltages are
out of phase, so we cannot simply add the maximum (or
rms) voltages across the elements. (In other words,

v  v R  v L  v C .)
33.3 (a) X L  X C . (b) X L  X C . (c) X L  X C .
33.4 Equation 33.23 indicates that at resonance (when
X L  X C ) the impedance is due strictly to the resistor,
Z  R . At resonance, the current is given by the expression I rms  V rms/R .

33.5 High. The higher the quality factor, the more sensitive
the detector. As you can see from Figure 33.15a, when
Q   0 / is high, as it is in the R  3.5 case, a slight
change in the resonance frequency (as might happen
when a small piece of metal passes through the portal)
causes a large change in current that can be detected
easily.
33.6 (a) An inductor. The current in an inductive circuit decreases with increasing frequency (see Eq. 33.9). Thus,
an inductor connected in series with a woofer blocks
high-frequency signals and passes low-frequency signals.
(b) A capacitor. The current in a capacitive circuit decreases with decreasing frequency (see Eq. 33.16). When
a capacitor is connected in series with a tweeter, the capacitor blocks low-frequency signals and passes highfrequency signals.

Electromagnetic Waves

James Clerk Maxwell

Scottish
theoretical physicist (1831 – 1879)
Maxwell developed the electromagnetic theory of light and the kinetic
theory of gases, and he explained the
nature of color vision and of Saturn’s
rings. His successful interpretation of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld produced
the ﬁeld equations that bear his
name. Formidable mathematical ability combined with great insight enabled Maxwell to lead the way in the
study of electromagnetism and kinetic
theory. He died of cancer before he
was 50. (North Wind Picture Archives)

he waves described in Chapters 16, 17, and 18 are mechanical waves. By deﬁnition, the propagation of mechanical disturbances — such as sound waves, water waves, and waves on a string — requires the presence of a medium. This
chapter is concerned with the properties of electromagnetic waves, which (unlike
mechanical waves) can propagate through empty space.
In Section 31.7 we gave a brief description of Maxwell’s equations, which form
the theoretical basis of all electromagnetic phenomena. The consequences of
Maxwell’s equations are far-reaching and dramatic. The Ampère – Maxwell law predicts that a time-varying electric ﬁeld produces a magnetic ﬁeld, just as Faraday’s
law tells us that a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld produces an electric ﬁeld. Maxwell’s
introduction of the concept of displacement current as a new source of a magnetic
ﬁeld provided the ﬁnal important link between electric and magnetic ﬁelds in classical physics.
Astonishingly, Maxwell’s equations also predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate through space at the speed of light c. This chapter begins with a discussion of how Heinrich Hertz conﬁrmed Maxwell’s prediction
when he generated and detected electromagnetic waves in 1887. That discovery
has led to many practical communication systems, including radio, television, and
radar. On a conceptual level, Maxwell uniﬁed the subjects of light and electromagnetism by developing the idea that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
Next, we learn how electromagnetic waves are generated by oscillating electric
charges. The waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds that are at right
angles to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. Thus, electromagnetic waves are transverse waves. Maxwell’s prediction of electromagnetic radiation
shows that the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in an electromagnetic
wave are related by the expression E ⫽ cB. The waves radiated from the oscillating
charges can be detected at great distances. Furthermore, electromagnetic waves
carry energy and momentum and hence can exert pressure on a surface.
The chapter concludes with a look at the wide range of frequencies covered by
electromagnetic waves. For example, radio waves (frequencies of about 107 Hz)
are electromagnetic waves produced by oscillating currents in a radio tower’s
transmitting antenna. Light waves are a high-frequency form of electromagnetic
radiation (about 1014 Hz) produced by oscillating electrons in atoms.

34.1 Maxwell’s Equations and Hertz’s Discoveries

As we shall see in the next section, Equations 34.3 and 34.4 can be combined to
obtain a wave equation for both the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld. In empty
space (Q ⫽ 0, I ⫽ 0), the solution to these two equations shows that the speed at
which electromagnetic waves travel equals the measured speed of light. This result
led Maxwell to predict that light waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation.
The experimental apparatus that Hertz used to generate and detect electromagnetic waves is shown schematically in Figure 34.1. An induction coil is connected to a transmitter made up of two spherical electrodes separated by a narrow
gap. The coil provides short voltage surges to the electrodes, making one positive
and the other negative. A spark is generated between the spheres when the electric ﬁeld near either electrode surpasses the dielectric strength for air (3 ⫻
106 V/m; see Table 26.1). In a strong electric ﬁeld, the acceleration of free electrons provides them with enough energy to ionize any molecules they strike. This
ionization provides more electrons, which can accelerate and cause further ionizations. As the air in the gap is ionized, it becomes a much better conductor, and the
discharge between the electrodes exhibits an oscillatory behavior at a very high
frequency. From an electric-circuit viewpoint, this is equivalent to an LC circuit in
which the inductance is that of the coil and the capacitance is due to the spherical
electrodes.
Because L and C are quite small in Hertz’s apparatus, the frequency of oscillation is very high, ⬇ 100 MHz. (Recall from Eq. 32.22 that ␻ ⫽ 1/√LC for an LC
circuit.) Electromagnetic waves are radiated at this frequency as a result of the oscillation (and hence acceleration) of free charges in the transmitter circuit. Hertz
was able to detect these waves by using a single loop of wire with its own spark gap
(the receiver). Such a receiver loop, placed several meters from the transmitter,
has its own effective inductance, capacitance, and natural frequency of oscillation.
In Hertz’s experiment, sparks were induced across the gap of the receiving electrodes when the frequency of the receiver was adjusted to match that of the transmitter. Thus, Hertz demonstrated that the oscillating current induced in the receiver was produced by electromagnetic waves radiated by the transmitter. His
experiment is analogous to the mechanical phenomenon in which a tuning fork
responds to acoustic vibrations from an identical tuning fork that is oscillating.

gap.

Heinrich Rudolf Hertz

German physicist (1857 – 1894) Hertz
made his most important discovery —
radio waves — in 1887. After ﬁnding
that the speed of a radio wave was
the same as that of light, he showed
that radio waves, like light waves,
could be reﬂected, refracted, and diffracted. Hertz died of blood poisoning
at age 36. He made many contributions to science during his short life.
The hertz, equal to one complete vibration or cycle per second, is named
after him. (The Bettmann Archive)

Additionally, Hertz showed in a series of experiments that the radiation generated by his spark-gap device exhibited the wave properties of interference, diffraction, reﬂection, refraction, and polarization, all of which are properties exhibited
by light. Thus, it became evident that the radio-frequency waves Hertz was generating had properties similar to those of light waves and differed only in frequency
and wavelength. Perhaps his most convincing experiment was the measurement of
the speed of this radiation. Radio-frequency waves of known frequency were reﬂected from a metal sheet and created a standing-wave interference pattern whose
nodal points could be detected. The measured distance between the nodal points
enabled determination of the wavelength ␭. Using the relationship v ⫽ ␭f (Eq.
16.14), Hertz found that v was close to 3 ⫻ 108 m/s, the known speed c of visible
light.

on x and t.

PLANE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

The properties of electromagnetic waves can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations. One approach to deriving these properties is to solve the second-order differential equation obtained from Maxwell’s third and fourth equations. A rigorous
mathematical treatment of that sort is beyond the scope of this text. To circumvent
this problem, we assume that the vectors for the electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld
in an electromagnetic wave have a speciﬁc space – time behavior that is simple but
consistent with Maxwell’s equations.
To understand the prediction of electromagnetic waves more fully, let us focus
our attention on an electromagnetic wave that travels in the x direction (the direction of propagation). In this wave, the electric ﬁeld E is in the y direction, and the
magnetic ﬁeld B is in the z direction, as shown in Figure 34.2. Waves such as this
one, in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are restricted to being parallel to a
pair of perpendicular axes, are said to be linearly polarized waves.1 Furthermore, we assume that at any point P, the magnitudes E and B of the ﬁelds depend

Waves having other particular patterns of vibration of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds include circularly polarized waves. The most general polarization pattern is elliptical.

34.2 Plane Electromagnetic Waves

upon x and t only, and not upon the y or z coordinate. A collection of such waves
from individual sources is called a plane wave. A surface connecting points of
equal phase on all waves, which we call a wave front, would be a geometric plane.
In comparison, a point source of radiation sends waves out in all directions. A surface connecting points of equal phase is a sphere for this situation, so we call this a
spherical wave.
We can relate E and B to each other with Equations 34.3 and 34.4. In empty
space, where Q ⫽ 0 and I ⫽ 0, Equation 34.3 remains unchanged and Equation
34.4 becomes

Using Equations 34.3 and 34.5 and the plane-wave assumption, we obtain the following differential equations relating E and B. (We shall derive these equations
formally later in this section.) For simplicity, we drop the subscripts on the components E y and Bz :

Note that the derivatives here are partial derivatives. For example, when we evaluate ⭸E/⭸x , we assume that t is constant. Likewise, when we evaluate ⭸B/⭸t, x is
held constant. Taking the derivative of Equation 34.6 with respect to x and combining the result with Equation 34.7, we obtain

same as the speed of light in empty space, we are led to believe (correctly) that
light is an electromagnetic wave.

That is, at every instant the ratio of the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld to the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld in an electromagnetic wave equals the
speed of light.
Finally, note that electromagnetic waves obey the superposition principle
(which we discussed in Section 16.4 with respect to mechanical waves) because the
differential equations involving E and B are linear equations. For example, we can
add two waves with the same frequency simply by adding the magnitudes of the
two electric ﬁelds algebraically.
• The solutions of Maxwell’s third and fourth equations are wave-like, with

both E and B satisfying a wave equation.

Let us again assume that the electromagnetic wave is traveling in the x direction,
with the electric ﬁeld E in the positive y direction and the magnetic ﬁeld B in the
positive z direction.
Consider a rectangle of width dx and height ᐉ lying in the xy plane, as shown
in Figure 34.5. To apply Equation 34.3, we must ﬁrst evaluate the line integral of
E ⴢ ds around this rectangle. The contributions from the top and bottom of the
rectangle are zero because E is perpendicular to ds for these paths. We can express the electric ﬁeld on the right side of the rectangle as

Figure 34.5 As a plane wave
passes through a rectangular path
of width dx lying in the xy plane,
the electric ﬁeld in the y direction
varies from E to E ⫹ d E. This spatial variation in E gives rise to a
time-varying magnetic ﬁeld along
the z direction, according to Equation 34.6.

Because the magnetic ﬁeld is in the z direction, the magnetic ﬂux through the rectangle of area ᐉ dx is approximately ⌽B ⫽ Bᐉ dx. (This assumes that dx is very
small compared with the wavelength of the wave.) Taking the time derivative of

equivalent to the partial derivative ⭸E /⭸x . Likewise, dB/dt means the change in B with time at a particular position x, so in Equation 34.15 we can replace dB/dt with ⭸B/⭸t .

This expression is Equation 34.6.
In a similar manner, we can verify Equation 34.7 by starting with Maxwell’s
fourth equation in empty space (Eq. 34.5). In this case, we evaluate the line integral of B ⴢ ds around a rectangle lying in the xz plane and having width dx and
length ᐉ, as shown in Figure 34.6. Noting that the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld
changes from B(x, t) to B(x ⫹ dx , t) over the width dx, we ﬁnd the line integral

ENERGY CARRIED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

Electromagnetic waves carry energy, and as they propagate through space they can
transfer energy to objects placed in their path. The rate of ﬂow of energy in an
electromagnetic wave is described by a vector S, called the Poynting vector,
which is deﬁned by the expression
S⬅

EⴛB
␮0

Poynting vector

(34.18)

The magnitude of the Poynting vector represents the rate at which energy ﬂows
through a unit surface area perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
Thus, the magnitude of the Poynting vector represents power per unit area. The direction of the vector is along the direction of wave propagation (Fig. 34.7). The SI
units of the Poynting vector are J/s ⭈m2 ⫽ W/m2.

What is of greater interest for a sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave is the
time average of S over one or more cycles, which is called the wave intensity I. (We
discussed the intensity of sound waves in Chapter 17.) When this average is taken,
we obtain an expression involving the time average of cos2(kx ⫺ ␻t), which equals
1

MOMENTUM AND RADIATION PRESSURE

Electromagnetic waves transport linear momentum as well as energy. It follows
that, as this momentum is absorbed by some surface, pressure is exerted on the
surface. We shall assume in this discussion that the electromagnetic wave strikes
the surface at normal incidence and transports a total energy U to the surface in a
time t. Maxwell showed that, if the surface absorbs all the incident energy U in this
time (as does a black body, introduced in Chapter 20), the total momentum p
transported to the surface has a magnitude

Note that Equation 34.24 is an expression for uppercase P, the pressure, while
Equation 34.23 is an expression for lowercase p, linear momentum.
If the surface is a perfect reﬂector (such as a mirror) and incidence is normal,
then the momentum transported to the surface in a time t is twice that given by
Equation 34.23. That is, the momentum transferred to the surface by the incoming light is p ⫽ U/c, and that transferred by the reﬂected light also is p ⫽ U/c.

A great amount of dust exists in interplanetary space. Although in theory these dust particles can vary in size from
molecular size to much larger, very little of the dust in our solar system is smaller than about 0.2 ␮m. Why?

Solution The dust particles are subject to two signiﬁcant
forces — the gravitational force that draws them toward the
Sun and the radiation-pressure force that pushes them away
from the Sun. The gravitational force is proportional to the

Pressure from a Laser Pointer

Many people giving presentations use a laser pointer to direct
the attention of the audience. If a 3.0-mW pointer creates a
spot that is 2.0 mm in diameter, determine the radiation pressure on a screen that reﬂects 70% of the light that strikes it.
The power 3.0 mW is a time-averaged value.

Solution We certainly do not expect the pressure to be
very large. Before we can calculate it, we must determine the
Poynting vector of the beam by dividing the time-averaged
power delivered via the electromagnetic wave by the crosssectional area of the beam:

particles having radii less than about 0.2 ␮m, the radiationpressure force is greater than the gravitational force, and as a
result these particles are swept out of the Solar System.

model the actual reﬂection as follows: Imagine that the surface absorbs the beam, resulting in pressure P ⫽ S /c. Then
the surface emits the beam, resulting in additional pressure

that f is the amount of the incident beam reﬂected), then the

If all of this power could be converted to electrical energy, it
would provide more than enough power for the average
home. However, solar energy is not easily harnessed, and the
prospects for large-scale conversion are not as bright as may
appear from this calculation. For example, the efﬁciency of
conversion from solar to electrical energy is typically 10% for
photovoltaic cells. Roof systems for converting solar energy to
internal energy are approximately 50% efﬁcient; however, solar energy is associated with other practical problems, such as

NASA is exploring the possibility of solar sailing as a low-cost means of sending
spacecraft to the planets. Large reﬂective sheets would be used in much the way
canvas sheets are used on earthbound sailboats. In 1973 NASA engineers took advantage of the momentum of the sunlight striking the solar panels of Mariner 10
(Fig. 34.9) to make small course corrections when the spacecraft’s fuel supply was
running low. (This procedure was carried out when the spacecraft was in the vicinity of the planet Mercury. Would it have worked as well near Pluto?)

RADIATION FROM AN INFINITE CURRENT SHEET

In this section, we describe the electric and magnetic ﬁelds radiated by a ﬂat conductor carrying a time-varying current. In the symmetric plane geometry employed here, the mathematics is less complex than that required in lower-symmetry situations.
Consider an inﬁnite conducting sheet lying in the yz plane and carrying a surface current in the y direction, as shown in Figure 34.10. The current is distributed
across the z direction such that the current per unit length is Js . Let us assume
that Js varies sinusoidally with time as
J s ⫽ J max cos ␻t
where J max is the amplitude of the current variation and ␻ is the angular frequency
of the variation. A similar problem concerning the case of a steady current was
treated in Example 30.6, in which we found that the magnetic ﬁeld outside the
sheet is everywhere parallel to the sheet and lies along the z axis. The magnetic
ﬁeld was found to have a magnitude

You should note two things about this solution, which is unique to the geometry
under consideration. First, when x is very small, it agrees with our original solution. Second, it satisﬁes the wave equation as expressed in Equation 34.9. We conclude that the magnetic ﬁeld lies along the z axis, varies with time, and is characterized by a transverse traveling wave having an angular frequency ␻ and an
angular wave number k ⫽ 2␲/␭.

That is, the electric ﬁeld is in the y direction, perpendicular to B, and has the same

We can calculate the Poynting vector for this wave from Equations 34.19,

electromagnetic radiation. The fundamental mechanism responsible for this
radiation is the acceleration of a charged particle. Whenever a charged particle accelerates, it must radiate energy.
An alternating voltage applied to the wires of an antenna forces an electric
charge in the antenna to oscillate. This is a common technique for accelerating
charges and is the source of the radio waves emitted by the transmitting antenna
of a radio station. Figure 34.12 shows how this is done. Two metal rods are connected to a generator that provides a sinusoidally oscillating voltage. This causes
charges to oscillate in the two rods. At t ⫽ 0, the upper rod is given a maximum
positive charge and the bottom rod an equal negative charge, as shown in Figure
34.12a. The electric ﬁeld near the antenna at this instant is also shown in Figure
34.12a. As the positive and negative charges decrease from their maximum values,
the rods become less charged, the ﬁeld near the rods decreases in strength, and
the downward-directed maximum electric ﬁeld produced at t ⫽ 0 moves away
from the rod. (A magnetic ﬁeld oscillating in a direction perpendicular to the
plane of the diagram in Fig. 34.12 accompanies the oscillating electric ﬁeld, but it
is not shown for the sake of clarity.) When the charges on the rods are momentarily zero (Fig. 34.12b), the electric ﬁeld at the rod has dropped to zero. This occurs
at a time equal to one quarter of the period of oscillation.
As the generator charges the rods in the opposite sense from that at the beginning, the upper rod soon obtains a maximum negative charge and the lower rod a
maximum positive charge (Fig. 34.12c); this results in an electric ﬁeld near the
rod that is directed upward after a time equal to one-half the period of oscillation.
The oscillations continue as indicated in Figure 34.12d. The electric ﬁeld near the
antenna oscillates in phase with the charge distribution. That is, the ﬁeld points
down when the upper rod is positive and up when the upper rod is negative. Furthermore, the magnitude of the ﬁeld at any instant depends on the amount of
charge on the rods at that instant.
As the charges continue to oscillate (and accelerate) between the rods, the
6

We have neglected the ﬁelds caused by the wires leading to the rods. This is a good approximation if
the circuit dimensions are much less than the length of the rods.

Figure 34.14

A half-wave antenna consists of two metal rods
connected to an alternating voltage
source. This diagram shows E and
B at an instant when the current is
upward. Note that the electric ﬁeld
lines resemble those of a dipole
(shown in Fig. 23.21).

Electromagnetic Waves

electric ﬁeld they set up moves away from the antenna at the speed of light. As you
can see from Figure 34.12, one cycle of charge oscillation produces one wavelength in the electric-ﬁeld pattern.
Next, consider what happens when two conducting rods are connected to the
terminals of a battery (Fig. 34.13). Before the switch is closed, the current is zero,
so no ﬁelds are present (Fig. 34.13a). Just after the switch is closed, positive charge
begins to build up on one rod and negative charge on the other (Fig. 34.13b), a
situation that corresponds to a time-varying current. The changing charge distribution causes the electric ﬁeld to change; this in turn produces a magnetic ﬁeld
around the rods.6 Finally, when the rods are fully charged, the current is zero;
hence, no magnetic ﬁeld exists at that instant (Fig. 34.13c).
Now let us consider the production of electromagnetic waves by a half-wave antenna. In this arrangement, two conducting rods are connected to a source of alternating voltage (such as an LC oscillator), as shown in Figure 34.14. The length of
each rod is equal to one quarter of the wavelength of the radiation that will be
emitted when the oscillator operates at frequency f. The oscillator forces charges
to accelerate back and forth between the two rods. Figure 34.14 shows the conﬁguration of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at some instant when the current is upward. The electric ﬁeld lines resemble those of an electric dipole. (As a result, this
type of antenna is sometimes called a dipole antenna.) Because these charges are
continuously oscillating between the two rods, the antenna can be approximated
by an oscillating electric dipole. The magnetic ﬁeld lines form concentric circles
around the antenna and are perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld lines at all points.
The magnetic ﬁeld is zero at all points along the axis of the antenna. Furthermore,
E and B are 90° out of phase in time because the current is zero when the charges
at the outer ends of the rods are at a maximum.
At the two points where the magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Figure 34.14, the Poynting vector S is directed radially outward. This indicates that energy is ﬂowing away
from the antenna at this instant. At later times, the ﬁelds and the Poynting vector
change direction as the current alternates. Because E and B are 90° out of phase
at points near the dipole, the net energy ﬂow is zero. From this, we might conclude (incorrectly) that no energy is radiated by the dipole.

34.7 The Spectrum of Electromagnetic Waves

However, we ﬁnd that energy is indeed radiated. Because the dipole ﬁelds fall
off as 1/r 3 (as shown in Example 23.6 for the electric ﬁeld of a static dipole), they
are not important at great distances from the antenna. However, at these great distances, something else causes a type of radiation different from that close to the
antenna. The source of this radiation is the continuous induction of an electric
ﬁeld by the time-varying magnetic ﬁeld and the induction of a magnetic ﬁeld by
the time-varying electric ﬁeld, predicted by Equations 34.3 and 34.4. The electric
and magnetic ﬁelds produced in this manner are in phase with each other and
vary as 1/r. The result is an outward ﬂow of energy at all times.
The electric ﬁeld lines produced by a dipole antenna at some instant are
shown in Figure 34.15 as they propagate away from the antenna. Note that the intensity and the power radiated are a maximum in a plane that is perpendicular to
the antenna and passing through its midpoint. Furthermore, the power radiated is
zero along the antenna’s axis. A mathematical solution to Maxwell’s equations for
the dipole antenna shows that the intensity of the radiation varies as (sin2␪ )/r 2,
where ␪ is measured from the axis of the antenna. The angular dependence of the
radiation intensity is sketched in Figure 34.16.
Electromagnetic waves can also induce currents in a receiving antenna. The
response of a dipole receiving antenna at a given position is a maximum when the
antenna axis is parallel to the electric ﬁeld at that point and zero when the axis is
perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld.

THE SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES

The various types of electromagnetic waves are listed in Figure 34.17, which shows
the electromagnetic spectrum. Note the wide ranges of frequencies and wavelengths. No sharp dividing point exists between one type of wave and the next. Remember that all forms of the various types of radiation are produced by the
same phenomenon — accelerating charges. The names given to the types of
waves are simply for convenience in describing the region of the spectrum in
which they lie.
Radio waves are the result of charges accelerating through conducting wires.
Ranging from more than 104 m to about 0.1 m in wavelength, they are generated
by such electronic devices as LC oscillators and are used in radio and television
communication systems.
Microwaves have wavelengths ranging from approximately 0.3 m to 10⫺4 m
and are also generated by electronic devices. Because of their short wavelengths,
they are well suited for radar systems and for studying the atomic and molecular
properties of matter. Microwave ovens (in which the wavelength of the radiation is
␭ ⫽ 0.122 m) are an interesting domestic application of these waves. It has been
suggested that solar energy could be harnessed by beaming microwaves to the
Earth from a solar collector in space.7

The electromagnetic spectrum. Note the overlap between adjacent wave types.

Infrared waves have wavelengths ranging from 10⫺3 m to the longest wavelength of visible light, 7 ⫻ 10⫺7 m. These waves, produced by molecules and
room-temperature objects, are readily absorbed by most materials. The infrared
(IR) energy absorbed by a substance appears as internal energy because the energy agitates the atoms of the object, increasing their vibrational or translational
motion, which results in a temperature increase. Infrared radiation has practical
and scientiﬁc applications in many areas, including physical therapy, IR photography, and vibrational spectroscopy.
Visible light, the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves, is the part of
the electromagnetic spectrum that the human eye can detect. Light is produced by
the rearrangement of electrons in atoms and molecules. The various wavelengths of
visible light, which correspond to different colors, range from red (␭ ⬇
7 ⫻ 10⫺7 m) to violet (␭ ⬇ 4 ⫻ 10⫺7 m). The sensitivity of the human eye is a function of wavelength, being a maximum at a wavelength of about 5.5 ⫻ 10⫺7 m. With
this in mind, why do you suppose tennis balls often have a yellow-green color?
Ultraviolet waves cover wavelengths ranging from approximately 4 ⫻ 10⫺7 m
to 6 ⫻ 10⫺10 m. The Sun is an important source of ultraviolet (UV) light, which is
the main cause of sunburn. Sunscreen lotions are transparent to visible light but
absorb most UV light. The higher a sunscreen’s solar protection factor (SPF), the
greater the percentage of UV light absorbed. Ultraviolet rays have also been impli-

Summary

cated in the formation of cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside the eye. Wearing
sunglasses that do not block UV light is worse for your eyes than wearing no sunglasses. The lenses of any sunglasses absorb some visible light, thus causing the
wearer’s pupils to dilate. If the glasses do not also block UV light, then more damage may be done to the lens of the eye because of the dilated pupils. If you wear no
sunglasses at all, your pupils are contracted, you squint, and a lot less UV light enters your eyes. High-quality sunglasses block nearly all the eye-damaging UV light.
Most of the UV light from the Sun is absorbed by ozone (O3 ) molecules in the
Earth’s upper atmosphere, in a layer called the stratosphere. This ozone shield
converts lethal high-energy UV radiation to infrared radiation, which in turn
warms the stratosphere. Recently, a great deal of controversy has arisen concerning the possible depletion of the protective ozone layer as a result of the chemicals
emitted from aerosol spray cans and used as refrigerants.
X-rays have wavelengths in the range from approximately 10⫺8 m to 10⫺12 m.
The most common source of x-rays is the deceleration of high-energy electrons
bombarding a metal target. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in medicine and as
a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because x-rays damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to avoid unnecessary exposure or overexposure. X-rays are also used in the study of crystal structure because x-ray wavelengths are comparable to the atomic separation distances in solids (about
0.1 nm).

EXAMPLE 34.7

A Half-Wave Antenna

A half-wave antenna works on the principle that the optimum length of the antenna is one-half the wavelength of
the radiation being received. What is the optimum length
of a car antenna when it receives a signal of frequency
94.0 MHz?

Thus, to operate most efﬁciently, the antenna should have a
length of (3.19 m)/2 ⫽ 1.60 m. For practical reasons, car antennas are usually one-quarter wavelength in size.

Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves emitted by radioactive nuclei (such as
and 137Cs) and during certain nuclear reactions. High-energy gamma rays are
a component of cosmic rays that enter the Earth’s atmosphere from space. They
have wavelengths ranging from approximately 10⫺10 m to less than 10⫺14 m. They
are highly penetrating and produce serious damage when absorbed by living tissues. Consequently, those working near such dangerous radiation must be protected with heavily absorbing materials, such as thick layers of lead.

Section 35.2 Measurements of the Speed of Light
1. The Apollo 11 astronauts set up a highly reﬂecting
panel on the Moon’s surface. The speed of light can be
found by measuring the time it takes a laser beam to
travel from Earth, reﬂect from the retroreﬂector, and
return to Earth. If this interval is measured to be 2.51 s,
what is the measured speed of light? Take the centerto-center distance from the Earth to the Moon to be
3.84 ⫻ 108 m, and do not neglect the sizes of the Earth
and the Moon.
2. As a result of his observations, Roemer concluded that
eclipses of Io by Jupiter were delayed by 22 min during
a six-month period as the Earth moved from the point
in its orbit where it is closest to Jupiter to the diametrically opposite point where it is farthest from Jupiter. Using 1.50 ⫻ 108 km as the average radius of the Earth’s
orbit around the Sun, calculate the speed of light from
these data.

3. In an experiment to measure the speed of light using
the apparatus of Fizeau (see Fig. 35.2), the distance between light source and mirror was 11.45 km and the
wheel had 720 notches. The experimentally determined
value of c was 2.998 ⫻ 108 m/s. Calculate the minimum
angular speed of the wheel for this experiment.
4. Figure P35.4 shows an apparatus used to measure the
speed distribution of gas molecules. It consists of two
slotted rotating disks separated by a distance d, with the
slots displaced by the angle ␪. Suppose that the speed of
light is measured by sending a light beam from the left
through this apparatus. (a) Show that a light beam will
be seen in the detector (that is, will make it through
both slots) only if its speed is given by c ⫽ ␻d /␪, where
␻ is the angular speed of the disks and ␪ is measured
in radians. (b) What is the measured speed of light if
the distance between the two slotted rotating disks is
2.50 m, the slot in the second disk is displaced 1/60 of
1° from the slot in the ﬁrst disk, and the disks are rotating at 5 555 rev/s?

his chapter is concerned with the images that result when spherical waves fall
on ﬂat and spherical surfaces. We ﬁnd that images can be formed either by reﬂection or by refraction and that mirrors and lenses work because of reﬂection
and refraction. We continue to use the ray approximation and to assume that
light travels in straight lines. Both of these steps lead to valid predictions in the
ﬁeld called geometric optics. In subsequent chapters, we shall concern ourselves
with interference and diffraction effects — the objects of study in the ﬁeld of wave
optics.

IMAGES FORMED BY FLAT MIRRORS

We begin by considering the simplest possible mirror, the ﬂat mirror. Consider a
point source of light placed at O in Figure 36.1, a distance p in front of a ﬂat mirror. The distance p is called the object distance. Light rays leave the source and
are reﬂected from the mirror. Upon reﬂection, the rays continue to diverge
(spread apart), but they appear to the viewer to come from a point I behind the
mirror. Point I is called the image of the object at O. Regardless of the system under study, we always locate images by extending diverging rays back to a point from
which they appear to diverge. Images are located either at the point from
which rays of light actually diverge or at the point from which they appear
to diverge. Because the rays in Figure 36.1 appear to originate at I, which is a distance q behind the mirror, this is the location of the image. The distance q is
called the image distance.
Images are classiﬁed as real or virtual. A real image is formed when light
rays pass through and diverge from the image point; a virtual image is
formed when the light rays do not pass through the image point but appear
to diverge from that point. The image formed by the mirror in Figure 36.1 is virtual. The image of an object seen in a ﬂat mirror is always virtual. Real images can
be displayed on a screen (as at a movie), but virtual images cannot be displayed on
a screen.
We can use the simple geometric techniques shown in Figure 36.2 to examine
the properties of the images formed by ﬂat mirrors. Even though an inﬁnite number of light rays leave each point on the object, we need to follow only two of them
to determine where an image is formed. One of those rays starts at P, follows a horizontal path to the mirror, and reﬂects back on itself. The second ray follows the
oblique path PR and reﬂects as shown, according to the law of reﬂection. An observer in front of the mirror would trace the two reﬂected rays back to the point at
which they appear to have originated, which is point P behind the mirror. A continuation of this process for points other than P on the object would result in a virtual image (represented by a yellow arrow) behind the mirror. Because triangles
PQR and P QR are congruent, PQ  PQ. We conclude that the image formed by
an object placed in front of a ﬂat mirror is as far behind the mirror as the
object is in front of the mirror.
Geometry also reveals that the object height h equals the image height h. Let
us deﬁne lateral magniﬁcation M as follows:

Lake. Why is the image inverted
and the same size as the mountain?

This is a general deﬁnition of the lateral magniﬁcation for any type of mirror. For
a ﬂat mirror, M  1 because h  h.
Finally, note that a ﬂat mirror produces an image that has an apparent
left – right reversal. You can see this reversal by standing in front of a mirror and
raising your right hand, as shown in Figure 36.3. The image you see raises its left
hand. Likewise, your hair appears to be parted on the side opposite your real part,
and a mole on your right cheek appears to be on your left cheek.
This reversal is not actually a left – right reversal. Imagine, for example, lying
on your left side on the ﬂoor, with your body parallel to the mirror surface. Now
your head is on the left and your feet are on the right. If you shake your feet, the
image does not shake its head! If you raise your right hand, however, the image
again raises its left hand. Thus, the mirror again appears to produce a left – right
reversal but in the up – down direction!
The reversal is actually a front – back reversal, caused by the light rays going forward toward the mirror and then reﬂecting back from it. An interesting exercise is
to stand in front of a mirror while holding an overhead transparency in front of
you so that you can read the writing on the transparency. You will be able to read
the writing on the image of the transparency, also. You may have had a similar experience if you have attached a transparent decal with words on it to the rear window of your car. If the decal can be read from outside the car, you can also read it
when looking into your rearview mirror from inside the car.
We conclude that the image that is formed by a ﬂat mirror has the following
properties.

• The image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.
• The image is unmagniﬁed, virtual, and upright. (By upright we mean that, if

the object arrow points upward as in Figure 36.2, so does the image arrow.)
• The image has front – back reversal.

View yourself in a full-length mirror.
Standing close to the mirror, place
one piece of tape at the top of the image of your head and another piece
at the very bottom of the image of
your feet. Now step back a few meters
and observe your image. How big is it
relative to its original size? How does
the distance between the pieces of
tape compare with your actual
height? You may want to refer to
Problem 3.

Figure 36.3 The image in the
mirror of a person’s right hand
is reversed front to back. This
makes the right hand appear to be
a left hand. Notice that the thumb
is on the left side of both real
hands and on the left side of the
image. That the thumb is not on
the right side of the image indicates that there is no left-to-right
reversal.

Multiple Images Formed by Two Mirrors

Two ﬂat mirrors are at right angles to each other, as illustrated in Figure 36.5, and an object is placed at point O. In
this situation, multiple images are formed. Locate the positions of these images.

Solution The image of the object is at I 1 in mirror 1 and
at I 2 in mirror 2. In addition, a third image is formed at I 3 .
This third image is the image of I 1 in mirror 2 or, equivalently, the image of I 2 in mirror 1. That is, the image at I 1 (or
I 2 ) serves as the object for I 3 . Note that to form this image at
I 3 , the rays reﬂect twice after leaving the object at O.

perpendicular mirrors as shown, three images are formed.

balancing himself on a few ﬁngers, with his feet off the ﬂoor.
He can maintain this position for a long time, and he appears
to defy gravity. How was this illusion created?

Solution

This is one of many magicians’ optical illusions
that make use of a mirror. The box in which the professor
stands is a cubical frame that contains a ﬂat vertical mirror positioned in a diagonal plane of the frame. The professor straddles the mirror so that one foot, which you see, is in front of
the mirror, and one foot, which you cannot see, is behind the
mirror. When he raises the foot in front of the mirror, the reﬂection of that foot also rises, so he appears to ﬂoat in air.

The Tilting Rearview Mirror

Most rearview mirrors in cars have a day setting and a night
setting. The night setting greatly diminishes the intensity of
the image in order that lights from trailing vehicles do not
blind the driver. How does such a mirror work?

Solution

Figure 36.7 shows a cross-sectional view of a
rearview mirror for each setting. The unit consists of a reﬂective coating on the back of a wedge of glass. In the day
setting (Fig. 36.7a), the light from an object behind the car
strikes the glass wedge at point 1. Most of the light enters the
wedge, refracting as it crosses the front surface, and reﬂects

from the back surface to return to the front surface, where it
is refracted again as it re-enters the air as ray B (for bright).
In addition, a small portion of the light is reﬂected at the
front surface of the glass, as indicated by ray D (for dim).
This dim reﬂected light is responsible for the image that is
observed when the mirror is in the night setting (Fig. 36.7b).
In this case, the wedge is rotated so that the path followed by
the bright light (ray B) does not lead to the eye. Instead, the
dim light reﬂected from the front surface of the wedge travels to the eye, and the brightness of trailing headlights does
not become a hazard.

IMAGES FORMED BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS

Concave Mirrors
14.7

A spherical mirror, as its name implies, has the shape of a section of a sphere.
This type of mirror focuses incoming parallel rays to a point, as demonstrated by
the colored light rays in Figure 36.8. Figure 36.9a shows a cross-section of a spherical mirror, with its surface represented by the solid, curved black line. (The blue
band represents the structural support for the mirrored surface, such as a curved
piece of glass on which the silvered surface is deposited.) Such a mirror, in which
light is reﬂected from the inner, concave surface, is called a concave mirror. The
mirror has a radius of curvature R , and its center of curvature is point C. Point V
is the center of the spherical section, and a line through C and V is called the
principal axis of the mirror.
Now consider a point source of light placed at point O in Figure 36.9b, where
O is any point on the principal axis to the left of C. Two diverging rays that originate at O are shown. After reﬂecting from the mirror, these rays converge (come
together) at the image point I. They then continue to diverge from I as if an object
were there. As a result, we have at point I a real image of the light source at O.
We shall consider in this section only rays that diverge from the object and
make a small angle with the principal axis. Such rays are called paraxial rays. All

where O is any point on the principal axis farther than R from the mirror surface, forms a real
image at I. If the rays diverge from O at small angles, they all reﬂect through the same image
point.

Figure 36.8 Red, blue, and
green light rays are reﬂected by
a curved mirror. Note that the
point where the three colors meet
is white.

such rays reﬂect through the image point, as shown in Figure 36.9b. Rays that are
far from the principal axis, such as those shown in Figure 36.10, converge to other
points on the principal axis, producing a blurred image. This effect, which is
called spherical aberration, is present to some extent for any spherical mirror
and is discussed in Section 36.5.
We can use Figure 36.11 to calculate the image distance q from a knowledge
of the object distance p and radius of curvature R . By convention, these distances
are measured from point V. Figure 36.11 shows two rays leaving the tip of the object. One of these rays passes through the center of curvature C of the mirror, hitting the mirror perpendicular to the mirror surface and reﬂecting back on itself.
The second ray strikes the mirror at its center (point V ) and reﬂects as shown,
obeying the law of reﬂection. The image of the tip of the arrow is located at the
point where these two rays intersect. From the gold right triangle in Figure 36.11,
we see that tan   h/p, and from the blue right triangle we see that tan u
 h/q. The negative sign is introduced because the image is inverted, so h is
taken to be negative. Thus, from Equation 36.1 and these results, we ﬁnd that the

Mirror equation in terms of R

This expression is called the mirror equation. It is applicable only to paraxial
rays.
If the object is very far from the mirror — that is, if p is so much greater than R
that p can be said to approach inﬁnity — then 1/p ⬇ 0, and we see from Equation
36.4 that q ⬇ R/2. That is, when the object is very far from the mirror, the image
point is halfway between the center of curvature and the center point on the mirror, as shown in Figure 36.12a. The incoming rays from the object are essentially
parallel in this ﬁgure because the source is assumed to be very far from the mirror.

Notice that the focal length of a mirror depends only on the curvature of the mirror and not on the material from which the mirror is made. This is because the
formation of the image results from rays reﬂected from the surface of the material. We shall ﬁnd in Section 36.4 that the situation is different for lenses; in that
case the light actually passes through the material.

Figure 36.13 shows the formation of an image by a convex mirror — that is, one
silvered so that light is reflected from the outer, convex surface. This is sometimes called a diverging mirror because the rays from any point on an object
diverge after reflection as though they were coming from some point behind
the mirror. The image in Figure 36.13 is virtual because the reflected rays only
appear to originate at the image point, as indicated by the dashed lines. Furthermore, the image is always upright and smaller than the object. This type of
mirror is often used in stores to foil shoplifters. A single mirror can be used to
survey a large field of view because it forms a smaller image of the interior of
the store.
We do not derive any equations for convex spherical mirrors because we can
use Equations 36.2, 36.4, and 36.6 for either concave or convex mirrors if we adhere to the following procedure. Let us refer to the region in which light rays
move toward the mirror as the front side of the mirror, and the other side as the
back side. For example, in Figures 36.10 and 36.12, the side to the left of the mirrors is the front side, and the side to the right of the mirrors is the back side. Figure 36.14 states the sign conventions for object and image distances, and Table
36.1 summarizes the sign conventions for all quantities.

Ray Diagrams for Mirrors
The positions and sizes of images formed by mirrors can be conveniently determined with ray diagrams. These graphical constructions reveal the nature of the
image and can be used to check results calculated from the mirror and magnification equations. To draw a ray diagram, we need to know the position of the object and the locations of the mirror’s focal point and center of curvature. We
then draw three rays to locate the image, as shown by the examples in Figure
36.15. These rays all start from the same object point and are drawn as follows.
We may choose any point on the object; here, we choose the top of the object for
simplicity:

Reﬂection of parallel lines from a
convex cylindrical mirror. The image is virtual, upright, and reduced
in size.

• Ray 1 is drawn from the top of the object parallel to the principal axis and is

reﬂected through the focal point F.
• Ray 2 is drawn from the top of the object through the focal point and is re-

ﬂected parallel to the principal axis.
• Ray 3 is drawn from the top of the object through the center of curvature C

and is reﬂected back on itself.
The intersection of any two of these rays locates the image. The third ray serves as
a check of the construction. The image point obtained in this fashion must always
agree with the value of q calculated from the mirror equation.
With concave mirrors, note what happens as the object is moved closer to the
mirror. The real, inverted image in Figure 36.15a moves to the left as the object
approaches the focal point. When the object is at the focal point, the image is inﬁnitely far to the left. However, when the object lies between the focal point and the
mirror surface, as shown in Figure 36.15b, the image is virtual, upright, and enlarged. This latter situation applies in the use of a shaving mirror or a makeup mirror. Your face is closer to the mirror than the focal point, and you see an upright,
enlarged image of your face.
In a convex mirror (see Fig. 36.15c), the image of an object is always virtual,
upright, and reduced in size. In this case, as the object distance increases, the virtual image decreases in size and approaches the focal point as p approaches inﬁnity. You should construct other diagrams to verify how image position varies with
object position.

36.2 Images Formed by Spherical Mirrors

EXAMPLE 36.4

The Image from a Mirror

Assume that a certain spherical mirror has a focal length of
 10.0 cm. Locate and describe the image for object distances of (a) 25.0 cm, (b) 10.0 cm, and (c) 5.00 cm.

Solution Because the focal length is positive, we know that
this is a concave mirror (see Table 36.1). (a) This situation is
analogous to that in Figure 36.15a; hence, we expect the image to be real and closer to the mirror than the object. According to the ﬁgure, it should also be inverted and reduced
in size. We ﬁnd the image distance by using the Equation
36.6 form of the mirror equation:

which means that rays originating from an object positioned
at the focal point of a mirror are reﬂected so that the image
is formed at an inﬁnite distance from the mirror; that is, the
rays travel parallel to one another after reﬂection. This is the
situation in a ﬂashlight, where the bulb ﬁlament is placed at
the focal point of a reﬂector, producing a parallel beam of
light.
(c) When the object is at p  5.00 cm, it lies between the
focal point and the mirror surface, as shown in Figure
36.15b. Thus, we expect a magniﬁed, virtual, upright image.
In this case, the mirror equation gives

The fact that the absolute value of M is less than unity tells us
that the image is smaller than the object, and the negative
sign for M tells us that the image is inverted. Because q is positive, the image is located on the front side of the mirror and
is real. Thus, we see that our predictions were correct.

IMAGES FORMED BY REFRACTION

In this section we describe how images are formed when light rays are refracted at
the boundary between two transparent materials. Consider two transparent media
having indices of refraction n 1 and n 2 , where the boundary between the two media is a spherical surface of radius R (Fig. 36.17). We assume that the object at O is
in the medium for which the index of refraction is n 1 , where n 1 n 2 . Let us consider the paraxial rays leaving O. As we shall see, all such rays are refracted at the
spherical surface and focus at a single point I, the image point.
Figure 36.18 shows a single ray leaving point O and focusing at point I. Snell’s
law of refraction applied to this refracted ray gives
n 1 sin  1  n 2 sin  2
Because  1 and  2 are assumed to be small, we can use the small-angle approximation sin  ⬇  (angles in radians) and say that
n 1 1  n 2 2
Now we use the fact that an exterior angle of any triangle equals the sum of the
two opposite interior angles. Applying this rule to triangles OPC and PIC in Figure
36.18 gives

1   
 2  
If we combine all three expressions and eliminate 1 and 2 , we ﬁnd that
n 1  n 2  (n 2  n 1 )

(36.7)

Looking at Figure 36.18, we see three right triangles that have a common vertical
leg of length d. For paraxial rays (unlike the relatively large-angle ray shown in Fig.

(36.8)

For a ﬁxed object distance p, the image distance q is independent of the angle that
the ray makes with the axis. This result tells us that all paraxial rays focus at the
same point I.
As with mirrors, we must use a sign convention if we are to apply this equation
to a variety of cases. We deﬁne the side of the surface in which light rays originate
as the front side. The other side is called the back side. Real images are formed by
refraction in back of the surface, in contrast with mirrors, where real images are
formed in front of the reﬂecting surface. Because of the difference in location of
real images, the refraction sign conventions for q and R are opposite the reﬂection
sign conventions. For example, q and R are both positive in Figure 36.18. The sign
conventions for spherical refracting surfaces are summarized in Table 36.2.
We derived Equation 36.8 from an assumption that n 1 n 2. This assumption
is not necessary, however. Equation 36.8 is valid regardless of which index of refraction is greater.

p is positive if object is in front of surface (real object).
p is negative if object is in back of surface (virtual object).
q is positive if image is in back of surface (real image).

R is positive if center of curvature is in back of convex surface.
R is negative if center of curvature is in front of concave surface.

Let’s Go Scuba Diving!

It is well known that objects viewed under water with the
naked eye appear blurred and out of focus. However, a scuba
diver using a mask has a clear view of underwater objects.
(a) Explain how this works, using the facts that the indices of
refraction of the cornea, water, and air are 1.376, 1.333, and
1.000 29, respectively.

Solution

Because the cornea and water have almost identical indices of refraction, very little refraction occurs when a
person under water views objects with the naked eye. In this
case, light rays from an object focus behind the retina, resulting in a blurred image. When a mask is used, the air space between the eye and the mask surface provides the normal

amount of refraction at the eye – air interface, and the light
from the object is focused on the retina.
(b) If a lens prescription is ground into the glass of a
mask, should the curved surface be on the inside of the
mask, the outside, or both?

Solution If a lens prescription is ground into the glass of
the mask so that the wearer can see without eyeglasses, only
the inside surface is curved. In this way the prescription is accurate whether the mask is used under water or in air. If the
curvature were on the outer surface, the refraction at the
outer surface of the glass would change depending on
whether air or water were present on the outside of the mask.

Gaze into the Crystal Ball

A dandelion seed ball 4.0 cm in diameter is embedded in the
center of a spherical plastic paperweight having a diameter of
6.0 cm (Fig. 36.20a). The index of refraction of the plastic is
n 1  1.50. Find the position of the image of the near edge of
the seed ball.
Because n 1 n 2 , where n 2  1.00 is the index
of refraction for air, the rays originating from the seed ball
are refracted away from the normal at the surface and diverge outward, as shown in Figure 36.20b. Hence, the image
is formed inside the paperweight and is virtual. From the
given dimensions, we know that the near edge of the seed
ball is 1.0 cm beneath the surface of the paperweight. Applying Equation 36.8 and noting from Table 36.2 that R is negative, we obtain

Solution

(36.9)

From this expression we see that the sign of q is opposite that of p. Thus, according
to Table 36.2, the image formed by a ﬂat refracting surface is on the same
side of the surface as the object. This is illustrated in Figure 36.19 for the situation in which the object is in the medium of index n 1 and n 1 is greater than n 2 . In
this case, a virtual image is formed between the object and the surface. If n 1 is less
than n 2 , the rays in the back side diverge from each other at lesser angles than
those in Figure 36.19. As a result, the virtual image is formed to the left of the
object.

the object, the image must be virtual (see Table 36.2). The
surface of the seed ball appears to be closer to the paperweight surface than it actually is.

THIN LENSES

Lenses are commonly used to form images by refraction in optical instruments,
such as cameras, telescopes, and microscopes. We can use what we just learned
about images formed by refracting surfaces to help us locate the image formed by
a lens. We recognize that light passing through a lens experiences refraction at two
surfaces. The development we shall follow is based on the notion that the image
formed by one refracting surface serves as the object for the second surface.
We shall analyze a thick lens ﬁrst and then let the thickness of the lens be approximately zero.
Consider a lens having an index of refraction n and two spherical surfaces
with radii of curvature R 1 and R 2 , as in Figure 36.22. (Note that R 1 is the radius of
curvature of the lens surface that the light leaving the object reaches ﬁrst and that
R 2 is the radius of curvature of the other surface of the lens.) An object is placed
at point O at a distance p 1 in front of surface 1. If the object were far from surface
1, the light rays from the object that struck the surface would be almost parallel to
each other. The refraction at the surface would focus these rays, forming a real image to the right of surface 1 in Figure 36.22 (as in Fig. 36.17). If the object is
placed close to surface 1, as shown in Figure 36.22, the rays diverging from the object and striking the surface cover a wide range of angles and are not parallel to
each other. In this case, the refraction at the surface is not sufﬁcient to cause the
rays to converge on the right side of the surface. They still diverge, although they
are closer to parallel than they were before they struck the surface. This results in
a virtual image of the object at I 1 to the left of the surface, as shown in Figure
36.22. This image is then used as the object for surface 2, which results in a real
image I 2 to the right of the lens.
Let us begin with the virtual image formed by surface 1. Using Equation 36.8
and assuming that n 1  1 because the lens is surrounded by air, we ﬁnd that the
image I 1 formed by surface 1 satisﬁes the equation

where q 1 is a negative number because it represents a virtual image formed on the

Now we apply Equation 36.8 to surface 2, taking n 1  n and n 2  1. (We
make this switch in index because the light rays from I 1 approaching surface 2 are
in the material of the lens, and this material has index n. We could also imagine removing the object at O, ﬁlling all of the space to the left of surface 1 with the mate-

We now introduce mathematically the fact that the image formed by the ﬁrst surface acts as the object for the second surface. We do this by noting from Figure

thickness of the lens. (Remember that q 1 is a negative number and that p 2 must be
positive by our sign convention — thus, we must introduce a negative sign for q 1 .)
For a thin lens (for which the thickness is small compared to the radii of curvature), we can neglect t. In this approximation, we see that p 2  q 1 . Hence,

curvature of a lens are given, this equation enables a calculation of the focal

of curvature). It is valid only for paraxial rays and only when the lens thickness is
much less than R 1 and R 2 .
The focal length f of a thin lens is the image distance that corresponds to an
inﬁnite object distance, just as with mirrors. Letting p approach  and q approach
f in Equation 36.10, we see that the inverse of the focal length for a thin lens is

This equation, called the thin-lens equation, can be used to relate the image distance and object distance for a thin lens.
Because light can travel in either direction through a lens, each lens has two
focal points, one for light rays passing through in one direction and one for rays
passing through in the other direction. This is illustrated in Figure 36.24 for a biconvex lens (two convex surfaces, resulting in a converging lens) and a biconcave
lens (two concave surfaces, resulting in a diverging lens). Focal point F 1 is sometimes called the object focal point, and F 2 is called the image focal point.
Figure 36.25 is useful for obtaining the signs of p and q, and Table 36.3 gives
the sign conventions for thin lenses. Note that these sign conventions are the same
as those for refracting surfaces (see Table 36.2). Applying these rules to a biconvex
lens, we see that when p f , the quantities p, q, and R 1 are positive, and R 2 is negative. Therefore, p, q, and f are all positive when a converging lens forms a real image of an object. For a biconcave lens, p and R 2 are positive and q and R 1 are negative, with the result that f is negative.
Various lens shapes are shown in Figure 36.26. Note that a converging lens is
thicker at the center than at the edge, whereas a diverging lens is thinner at the
center than at the edge.

R 1 and R 2 are positive if center of curvature is in back of lens.
R 1 and R 2 are negative if center of curvature is in front of lens.

Magniﬁcation of Images

(b)

Consider a thin lens through which light rays from an object pass. As with mirrors
(Eq. 36.2), the lateral magniﬁcation of the lens is deﬁned as the ratio of the image
height h to the object height h:

From this expression, it follows that when M is positive, the image is upright and
on the same side of the lens as the object. When M is negative, the image is inverted and on the side of the lens opposite the object.

To locate the image of a diverging lens (Fig. 36.27c), the following three rays are
drawn from the top of the object:
• Ray 1 is drawn parallel to the principal axis. After being refracted by the lens,

this ray emerges such that it appears to have passed through the focal point
on the front side of the lens. (This apparent direction is indicated by the
dashed line in Fig. 36.27c.)
• Ray 2 is drawn through the center of the lens and continues in a straight line.
• Ray 3 is drawn toward the focal point on the back side of the lens and
emerges from the lens parallel to the optic axis.

Quick Quiz 36.3
In Figure 36.27a, the blue object arrow is replaced by one that is much taller than the lens.
How many rays from the object will strike the lens?

Figure 36.28

The Fresnel lens
on the left has the same focal
length as the thick lens on the right
but is made of much less glass.

For the converging lens in Figure 36.27a, where the object is to the left of the
object focal point (p f 1), the image is real and inverted. When the object is between the object focal point and the lens (p f 1), as shown in Figure 36.27b, the
image is virtual and upright. For a diverging lens (see Fig. 36.27c), the image is always virtual and upright, regardless of where the object is placed. These geometric
constructions are reasonably accurate only if the distance between the rays and the
principal axis is much less than the radii of the lens surfaces.
It is important to realize that refraction occurs only at the surfaces of the lens.
A certain lens design takes advantage of this fact to produce the Fresnel lens, a powerful lens without great thickness. Because only the surface curvature is important
in the refracting qualities of the lens, material in the middle of a Fresnel lens is removed, as shown in Figure 36.28. Because the edges of the curved segments cause
some distortion, Fresnel lenses are usually used only in situations in which image
quality is less important than reduction of weight.
The lines that are visible across the faces of most automobile headlights are
the edges of these curved segments. A headlight requires a short-focal-length lens
to collimate light from the nearby ﬁlament into a parallel beam. If it were not for
the Fresnel design, the glass would be very thick in the center and quite heavy. The
weight of the glass would probably cause the thin edge where the lens is supported
to break when subjected to the shocks and vibrations that are typical of travel on
rough roads.

in air and water:

Combination of Thin Lenses

Light from a distant object brought
into focus by two converging
lenses.

If two thin lenses are used to form an image, the system can be treated in the following manner. First, the image formed by the ﬁrst lens is located as if the second
lens were not present. Then a ray diagram is drawn for the second lens, with the
image formed by the ﬁrst lens now serving as the object for the second lens. The
second image formed is the ﬁnal image of the system. One conﬁguration is particularly straightforward; that is, if the image formed by the ﬁrst lens lies on the back
side of the second lens, then that image is treated as a virtual object for the second lens (that is, p is negative). The same procedure can be extended to a system
of three or more lenses. The overall magniﬁcation of a system of thin lenses equals
the product of the magniﬁcations of the separate lenses.
Let us consider the special case of a system of two lenses in contact. Suppose
two thin lenses of focal lengths f 1 and f 2 are placed in contact with each other. If p
is the object distance for the combination, application of the thin-lens equation
(Eq. 36.12) to the ﬁrst lens gives

where q 1 is the image distance for the ﬁrst lens. Treating this image as the object
for the second lens, we see that the object distance for the second lens must be

Because the two thin lenses are touching, q is also the distance of the ﬁnal image

equivalent to a single thin lens having a focal length given by Equation
36.13.

Where Is the Final Image?

Even when the conditions just described do not apply, the
lens equations yield image position and magniﬁcation. For
example, two thin converging lenses of focal lengths
f 1  10.0 cm and f 2  20.0 cm are separated by 20.0 cm, as
illustrated in Figure 36.29. An object is placed 15.0 cm to the
left of lens 1. Find the position of the ﬁnal image and the
magniﬁcation of the system.

Watch Your p’s and q’s!

Use a spreadsheet or a similar tool to create two graphs of image distance as a function of object distance — one for a lens
for which the focal length is 10 cm and one for a lens for
which the focal length is  10 cm.

Solution The graphs are shown in Figure 36.30. In each
graph a gap occurs where p  f, which we shall discuss. Note
the similarity in the shapes — a result of the fact that image
and object distances for both lenses are related according to
the same equation — the thin-lens equation.
The curve in the upper right portion of the f  10 cm
graph corresponds to an object on the front side of a lens,
which we have drawn as the left side of the lens in our previous
diagrams. When the object is at positive inﬁnity, a real image
forms at the focal point on the back side (the positive side) of
the lens, q  f. (The incoming rays are parallel in this case.) As
the object gets closer to the lens, the image moves farther from
the lens, corresponding to the upward path of the curve. This
continues until the object is located at the focal point on the

near side of the lens. At this point, the rays leaving the lens are
parallel, making the image inﬁnitely far away. This is described
in the graph by the asymptotic approach of the curve to the
line p  f  10 cm.
As the object moves inside the focal point, the image becomes virtual and located near q   . We are now following the curve in the lower left portion of Figure 36.30a. As
the object moves closer to the lens, the virtual image also
moves closer to the lens. As p : 0, the image distance q also
approaches 0. Now imagine that we bring the object to the
back side of the lens, where p 0. The object is now a virtual
object, so it must have been formed by some other lens. For
all locations of the virtual object, the image distance is positive and less than the focal length. The ﬁnal image is real,
and its position approaches the focal point as p gets more
and more negative.
The f   10 cm graph shows that a distant real object
forms an image at the focal point on the front side of the
lens. As the object approaches the lens, the image remains

1162

CHAPTER 36

virtual and moves closer to the lens. But as we continue toward the left end of the p axis, the object becomes virtual. As
the position of this virtual object approaches the focal point,
the image recedes toward inﬁnity. As we pass the focal point,

the image shifts from a location at positive inﬁnity to one at
negative inﬁnity. Finally, as the virtual object continues moving away from the lens, the image is virtual, starts moving in
from negative inﬁnity, and approaches the focal point.

LENS ABERRATIONS

One problem with lenses is imperfect images. The theory of mirrors and lenses that
we have been using assumes that rays make small angles with the principal axis and
that the lenses are thin. In this simple model, all rays leaving a point source focus at
a single point, producing a sharp image. Clearly, this is not always true. When the
approximations used in this theory do not hold, imperfect images are formed.
A precise analysis of image formation requires tracing each ray, using Snell’s
law at each refracting surface and the law of reﬂection at each reﬂecting surface.
This procedure shows that the rays from a point object do not focus at a single
point, with the result that the image is blurred. The departures of actual (imperfect) images from the ideal predicted by theory are called aberrations.

Spherical Aberrations

Figure 36.31

Spherical aberration caused by a converging lens.
Does a diverging lens cause spherical aberration?

Spherical aberrations occur because the focal points of rays far from the principal
axis of a spherical lens (or mirror) are different from the focal points of rays of the
same wavelength passing near the axis. Figure 36.31 illustrates spherical aberration
for parallel rays passing through a converging lens. Rays passing through points
near the center of the lens are imaged farther from the lens than rays passing
through points near the edges.
Many cameras have an adjustable aperture to control light intensity and reduce spherical aberration. (An aperture is an opening that controls the amount of
light passing through the lens.) Sharper images are produced as the aperture size
is reduced because with a small aperture only the central portion of the lens is exposed to the light; as a result, a greater percentage of the rays are paraxial. At the

Lens aberrations. (a) Spherical aberration occurs when light passing through the lens at different
distances from the principal axis is focused at different points. (b) Astigmatism occurs for objects

far from the principal axis and light passing near the center of the lens focus at different parts of
the focal plane.

same time, however, less light passes through the lens. To compensate for this
lower light intensity, a longer exposure time is used.
In the case of mirrors used for very distant objects, spherical aberration can be
minimized through the use of a parabolic reﬂecting surface rather than a spherical surface. Parabolic surfaces are not used often, however, because those with
high-quality optics are very expensive to make. Parallel light rays incident on a parabolic surface focus at a common point, regardless of their distance from the principal axis. Parabolic reﬂecting surfaces are used in many astronomical telescopes
to enhance image quality.

Chromatic Aberrations
The fact that different wavelengths of light refracted by a lens focus at different
points gives rise to chromatic aberrations. In Chapter 35 we described how the index of refraction of a material varies with wavelength. For instance, when white
light passes through a lens, violet rays are refracted more than red rays (Fig.
36.32). From this we see that the focal length is greater for red light than for violet
light. Other wavelengths (not shown in Fig. 36.32) have focal points intermediate
between those of red and violet.
Chromatic aberration for a diverging lens also results in a shorter focal length
for violet light than for red light, but on the front side of the lens. Chromatic aberration can be greatly reduced by combining a converging lens made of one type of
glass and a diverging lens made of another type of glass.

plished with an adjustable bellows in older-style cameras and with some other mechanical arrangement in modern cameras. For proper focusing — which is necessary for the formation of sharp images — the lens-to-ﬁlm distance depends on the
object distance as well as on the focal length of the lens.
The shutter, positioned behind the lens, is a mechanical device that is opened
for selected time intervals, called exposure times. One can photograph moving objects by using short exposure times, or photograph dark scenes (with low light levels) by using long exposure times. If this adjustment were not available, it would
be impossible to take stop-action photographs. For example, a rapidly moving vehicle could move enough in the time that the shutter was open to produce a
blurred image. Another major cause of blurred images is the movement of the
camera while the shutter is open. To prevent such movement, either short exposure times or a tripod should be used, even for stationary objects. Typical shutter
speeds (that is, exposure times) are 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, and 1/250 s. For handheld
cameras, the use of slower speeds can result in blurred images (due to movement),
but the use of faster speeds reduces the gathered light intensity. In practice, stationary objects are normally shot with an intermediate shutter speed of 1/60 s.
More expensive cameras have an aperture of adjustable diameter to further
control the intensity of the light reaching the ﬁlm. As noted earlier, when an aperture of small diameter is used, only light from the central portion of the lens
reaches the ﬁlm; in this way spherical aberration is reduced.
The intensity I of the light reaching the ﬁlm is proportional to the area of the
lens. Because this area is proportional to the square of the diameter D, we conclude that I is also proportional to D 2. Light intensity is a measure of the rate at
which energy is received by the ﬁlm per unit area of the image. Because the area
of the image is proportional to q 2, and q ⬇ f (when p W f, so p can be approximated as inﬁnite), we conclude that the intensity is also proportional to 1/f 2, and
thus I D 2/f 2. The brightness of the image formed on the ﬁlm depends on the
light intensity, so we see that the image brightness depends on both the focal
length and the diameter of the lens.
The ratio f/D is called the f-number of a lens:
f -number ⬅

Hence, the intensity of light incident on the ﬁlm can be expressed as
I

1
( f/D)2

1
( f -number)2

(36.15)

The f-number is often given as a description of the lens “speed.” The lower the
f-number, the wider the aperture and the higher the rate at which energy from
the light exposes the ﬁlm — thus, a lens with a low f-number is a “fast” lens. The
conventional notation for an f-number is “f/” followed by the actual number. For
example, “f/4” means an f-number of 4 — it does not mean to divide f by 4! Extremely fast lenses, which have f-numbers as low as approximately f/1.2, are expensive because it is very difﬁcult to keep aberrations acceptably small with light
rays passing through a large area of the lens. Camera lens systems (that is, combinations of lenses with adjustable apertures) are often marked with multiple f-numbers, usually f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, and f/16. Any one of these settings can
be selected by adjusting the aperture, which changes the value of D. Increasing the
setting from one f-number to the next higher value (for example, from f/2.8 to
f/4) decreases the area of the aperture by a factor of two. The lowest f-number set-

ting on a camera lens corresponds to a wide-open aperture and the use of the
maximum possible lens area.
Simple cameras usually have a ﬁxed focal length and a ﬁxed aperture size,
with an f-number of about f/11. This high value for the f-number allows for a
large depth of ﬁeld, meaning that objects at a wide range of distances from the
lens form reasonably sharp images on the ﬁlm. In other words, the camera does
not have to be focused.

EXAMPLE 36.14

Finding the Correct Exposure Time

The lens of a certain 35-mm camera (where 35 mm is the
width of the ﬁlm strip) has a focal length of 55 mm and a
speed (an f-number) of f/1.8. The correct exposure time for
this speed under certain conditions is known to be (1/500) s.

(b) Calculate the correct exposure time if the f-number is

Solution The total light energy hitting the ﬁlm is proportional to the product of the intensity and the exposure time.
If I is the light intensity reaching the ﬁlm, then in a time t

the energy per unit area received by the ﬁlm is proportional
to It. Comparing the two situations, we require that
I 1t 1  I 2t 2 , where t 1 is the correct exposure time for f/1.8
and t 2 is the correct exposure time for f/4. Using this result

THE EYE

Like a camera, a normal eye focuses light and produces a sharp image. However,
the mechanisms by which the eye controls the amount of light admitted and adjusts to produce correctly focused images are far more complex, intricate, and effective than those in even the most sophisticated camera. In all respects, the eye is
a physiological wonder.
Figure 36.34 shows the essential parts of the human eye. Light entering the
eye passes through a transparent structure called the cornea, behind which are a
clear liquid (the aqueous humor), a variable aperture (the pupil, which is an opening in the iris), and the crystalline lens. Most of the refraction occurs at the outer
surface of the eye, where the cornea is covered with a ﬁlm of tears. Relatively little
refraction occurs in the crystalline lens because the aqueous humor in contact
with the lens has an average index of refraction close to that of the lens. The iris,
which is the colored portion of the eye, is a muscular diaphragm that controls
pupil size. The iris regulates the amount of light entering the eye by dilating the
pupil in low-light conditions and contracting the pupil in high-light conditions.
The f-number range of the eye is from about f/2.8 to f/16.
The cornea – lens system focuses light onto the back surface of the eye, the
retina, which consists of millions of sensitive receptors called rods and cones. When
stimulated by light, these receptors send impulses via the optic nerve to the brain,

where an image is perceived. By this process, a distinct image of an object is observed when the image falls on the retina.
The eye focuses on an object by varying the shape of the pliable crystalline
lens through an amazing process called accommodation. An important component of accommodation is the ciliary muscle, which is situated in a circle around the
rim of the lens. Thin ﬁlaments, called zonules, run from this muscle to the edge of
the lens. When the eye is focused on a distant object, the ciliary muscle is relaxed,
tightening the zonules that attach the muscle to the edge of the lens. The force of
the zonules causes the lens to ﬂatten, increasing its focal length. For an object distance of inﬁnity, the focal length of the eye is equal to the ﬁxed distance between
lens and retina, about 1.7 cm. The eye focuses on nearby objects by tensing the ciliary muscle, which relaxes the zonules. This action allows the lens to bulge a bit,
and its focal length decreases, resulting in the image being focused on the retina.
All these lens adjustments take place so swiftly that we are not even aware of the
change. In this respect, even the ﬁnest electronic camera is a toy compared with
the eye.
Accommodation is limited in that objects that are very close to the eye produce blurred images. The near point is the closest distance for which the lens can
accommodate to focus light on the retina. This distance usually increases with age
and has an average value of 25 cm. Typically, at age 10 the near point of the eye is
about 18 cm. It increases to about 25 cm at age 20, to 50 cm at age 40, and to 500
cm or greater at age 60. The far point of the eye represents the greatest distance
for which the lens of the relaxed eye can focus light on the retina. A person with
normal vision can see very distant objects, such as the Moon, and thus has a far
point near inﬁnity.
Recall that the light leaving the mirror in Figure 36.8 becomes white where it
comes together but then diverges into separate colors again. Because nothing but
air exists at the point where the rays cross (and hence nothing exists to cause the
colors to separate again), seeing white light as a result of a combination of colors
must be a visual illusion. In fact, this is the case. Only three types of color-sensitive

cells are present in the retina; they are called red, green, and blue cones because
of the peaks of the color ranges to which they respond (Fig. 36.35). If the red and
green cones are stimulated simultaneously (as would be the case if yellow light
were shining on them), the brain interprets what we see as yellow. If all three types
of cones are stimulated by the separate colors red, blue, and green, as in Figure
36.8, we see white. If all three types of cones are stimulated by light that contains
all colors, such as sunlight, we again see white light.
Color televisions take advantage of this visual illusion by having only red,
green, and blue dots on the screen. With speciﬁc combinations of brightness in
these three primary colors, our eyes can be made to see any color in the rainbow.
Thus, the yellow lemon you see in a television commercial is not really yellow, it is
red and green! The paper on which this page is printed is made of tiny, matted,
translucent ﬁbers that scatter light in all directions; the resultant mixture of colors
appears white to the eye. Snow, clouds, and white hair are not really white. In fact,
there is no such thing as a white pigment. The appearance of these things is a consequence of the scattering of light containing all colors, which we interpret as
white.

Conditions of the Eye
When the eye suffers a mismatch between the focusing range of the lens – cornea
system and the length of the eye, with the result that light rays reach the retina before they converge to form an image, as shown in Figure 36.36a, the condition is
known as farsightedness (or hyperopia). A farsighted person can usually see faraway objects clearly but not nearby objects. Although the near point of a normal
eye is approximately 25 cm, the near point of a farsighted person is much farther
away. The eye of a farsighted person tries to focus by accommodation — that is, by
shortening its focal length. This works for distant objects, but because the focal
length of the farsighted eye is greater than normal, the light from nearby objects
cannot be brought to a sharp focus before it reaches the retina, and it thus causes
a blurred image. The refracting power in the cornea and lens is insufﬁcient to focus the light from all but distant objects satisfactorily. The condition can be corrected by placing a converging lens in front of the eye, as shown in Figure 36.36b.
The lens refracts the incoming rays more toward the principal axis before entering
the eye, allowing them to converge and focus on the retina.
A person with nearsightedness (or myopia), another mismatch condition, can
focus on nearby objects but not on faraway objects. In the case of axial myopia, the
nearsightedness is caused by the lens being too far from the retina. In refractive my-

opia, the lens – cornea system is too powerful for the length of the eye. The far
point of the nearsighted eye is not inﬁnity and may be less than 1 m. The maximum focal length of the nearsighted eye is insufﬁcient to produce a sharp image
on the retina, and rays from a distant object converge to a focus in front of the
retina. They then continue past that point, diverging before they ﬁnally reach the
retina and causing blurred vision (Fig. 36.37a). Nearsightedness can be corrected
with a diverging lens, as shown in Figure 36.37b. The lens refracts the rays away
from the principal axis before they enter the eye, allowing them to focus on the
retina.

Figure 36.38
Beginning in middle age, most people lose some of their accommodation ability as the ciliary muscle weakens and the lens hardens. Unlike farsightedness,
which is a mismatch between focusing power and eye length, presbyopia (literally, “old-age vision”) is due to a reduction in accommodation ability. The cornea
and lens do not have sufﬁcient focusing power to bring nearby objects into focus
on the retina. The symptoms are the same as those of farsightedness, and the condition can be corrected with converging lenses.
In the eye defect known as astigmatism, light from a point source produces a
line image on the retina. This condition arises when either the cornea or the lens
or both are not perfectly symmetric. Astigmatism can be corrected with lenses that
have different curvatures in two mutually perpendicular directions.

Geometric Optics

Optometrists and ophthalmologists usually prescribe lenses1 measured in
diopters:
The power P of a lens in diopters equals the inverse of the focal length in meters: P  1/f.
For example, a converging lens of focal length  20 cm has a power of  5.0
diopters, and a diverging lens of focal length  40 cm has a power of  2.5
diopters.

EXAMPLE 36.15

A Case of Nearsightedness

A particular nearsighted person is unable to see objects
clearly when they are beyond 2.5 m away (the far point of this
particular eye). What should the focal length be in a lens prescribed to correct this problem?

Solution The purpose of the lens in this instance is to
“move” an object from inﬁnity to a distance where it can be
seen clearly. This is accomplished by having the lens produce
an image at the far point. From the thin-lens equation, we
have

f  2.5 m
Why did we use a negative sign for the image distance? As you
should have suspected, the lens must be a diverging lens (one
with a negative focal length) to correct nearsightedness.

THE SIMPLE MAGNIFIER

The simple magniﬁer consists of a single converging lens. As the name implies,
this device increases the apparent size of an object.
Suppose an object is viewed at some distance p from the eye, as illustrated in
Figure 36.39. The size of the image formed at the retina depends on the angle 
subtended by the object at the eye. As the object moves closer to the eye,  increases and a larger image is observed. However, an average normal eye cannot focus on an object closer than about 25 cm, the near point (Fig. 36.40a). Therefore,
 is maximum at the near point.
To further increase the apparent angular size of an object, a converging lens
can be placed in front of the eye as in Figure 36.40b, with the object located at
point O, just inside the focal point of the lens. At this location, the lens forms a virtual, upright, enlarged image. We deﬁne angular magniﬁcation m as the ratio of
the angle subtended by an object with a lens in use (angle  in Fig. 36.40b) to the
angle subtended by the object placed at the near point with no lens in use (angle

1 The word lens comes from lentil, the name of an Italian legume. (You may have eaten lentil soup.)
Early eyeglasses were called “glass lentils” because the biconvex shape of their lenses resembled the
shape of a lentil. The ﬁrst lenses for farsightedness and presbyopia appeared around 1280; concave eyeglasses for correcting nearsightedness did not appear for more than 100 years after that.

The microscope has extended human vision to the point where we can view
previously unknown details of incredibly small objects. The capabilities of this instrument have steadily increased with improved techniques for precision grinding
of lenses. An often-asked question about microscopes is: “If one were extremely
patient and careful, would it be possible to construct a microscope that would enable the human eye to see an atom?” The answer is no, as long as light is used to illuminate the object. The reason is that, for an object under an optical microscope
(one that uses visible light) to be seen, the object must be at least as large as a
wavelength of light. Because the diameter of any atom is many times smaller than
the wavelengths of visible light, the mysteries of the atom must be probed using
other types of “microscopes.”
The ability to use other types of waves to “see” objects also depends on wavelength. We can illustrate this with water waves in a bathtub. Suppose you vibrate
your hand in the water until waves having a wavelength of about 15 cm are moving
along the surface. If you hold a small object, such as a toothpick, so that it lies in
the path of the waves, it does not appreciably disturb the waves; they continue
along their path “oblivious” to it. Now suppose you hold a larger object, such as a
toy sailboat, in the path of the 15-cm waves. In this case, the waves are considerably
disturbed by the object. Because the toothpick was smaller than the wavelength of
the waves, the waves did not “see” it (the intensity of the scattered waves was low).
Because it is about the same size as the wavelength of the waves, however, the boat
creates a disturbance. In other words, the object acts as the source of scattered
waves that appear to come from it.
Light waves behave in this same general way. The ability of an optical microscope to view an object depends on the size of the object relative to the wavelength
of the light used to observe it. Hence, we can never observe atoms with an optical

THE TELESCOPE

Two fundamentally different types of telescopes exist; both are designed to aid in
viewing distant objects, such as the planets in our Solar System. The refracting
telescope uses a combination of lenses to form an image, and the reﬂecting telescope uses a curved mirror and a lens.
The lens combination shown in Figure 36.42a is that of a refracting telescope.
Like the compound microscope, this telescope has an objective and an eyepiece.
The two lenses are arranged so that the objective forms a real, inverted image of
the distant object very near the focal point of the eyepiece. Because the object is
essentially at inﬁnity, this point at which I 1 forms is the focal point of the objective.
Hence, the two lenses are separated by a distance f o  f e , which corresponds to
the length of the telescope tube. The eyepiece then forms, at I 2 , an enlarged, inverted image of the image at I 1 .
The angular magniﬁcation of the telescope is given by / o , where  o is the
angle subtended by the object at the objective and  is the angle subtended by the
ﬁnal image at the viewer’s eye. Consider Figure 36.42a, in which the object is a
very great distance to the left of the ﬁgure. The angle  o (to the left of the objective) subtended by the object at the objective is the same as the angle (to the right

where the negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.
The angle  subtended by the ﬁnal image at the eye is the same as the angle

makes with the principal axis after it passes through the lens. Thus,

We have not used a negative sign in this equation because the ﬁnal image is not inverted; the object creating this ﬁnal image I 2 is I 1 , and both it and I 2 point in the
same direction. To see why the adjacent side of the triangle containing angle  is f e
and not 2f e , note that we must use only the bent length of the refracted ray.
Hence, the angular magniﬁcation of the telescope can be expressed as

When we look through a telescope at such relatively nearby objects as the
Moon and the planets, magniﬁcation is important. However, stars are so far away
that they always appear as small points of light no matter how great the magniﬁcation. A large research telescope that is used to study very distant objects must have
a great diameter to gather as much light as possible. It is difﬁcult and expensive to
manufacture large lenses for refracting telescopes. Another difﬁculty with large
lenses is that their weight leads to sagging, which is an additional source of aberration. These problems can be partially overcome by replacing the objective with a
concave mirror, which results in a reﬂecting telescope. Because light is reﬂected
from the mirror and does not pass through a lens, the mirror can have rigid supports on the back side. Such supports eliminate the problem of sagging.
Figure 36.43 shows the design for a typical reﬂecting telescope. Incoming light
rays pass down the barrel of the telescope and are reﬂected by a parabolic mirror
at the base. These rays converge toward point A in the ﬁgure, where an image
would be formed. However, before this image is formed, a small, ﬂat mirror M reﬂects the light toward an opening in the side of the tube that passes into an eyepiece. This particular design is said to have a Newtonian focus because Newton developed it. Note that in the reﬂecting telescope the light never passes through
glass (except through the small eyepiece). As a result, problems associated with
chromatic aberration are virtually eliminated.
The largest reﬂecting telescopes in the world are at the Keck Observatory on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The site includes two telescopes with diameters of 10 m, each
containing 36 hexagonally shaped, computer-controlled mirrors that work together to form a large reﬂecting surface. In contrast, the largest refracting telescope in the world, at the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, has a diameter of only 1 m.

16. A mirage is formed when the air gets gradually cooler
with increasing altitude. What might happen if the air

18. In a Jules Verne novel, a piece of ice is shaped into a magnifying lens to focus sunlight to start a ﬁre. Is this possible?

concave mirror to reﬂect and focus sunlight into a furnace enclosure. What factors in the design of the reﬂecting mirror would guarantee very high temperatures?
21. One method for determining the position of an image,
either real or virtual, is by means of parallax. If a ﬁnger or
another object is placed at the position of the image, as
shown in Figure Q36.21, and the ﬁnger and the image
are viewed simultaneously (the image is viewed through
the lens if it is virtual), the ﬁnger and image have the
same parallax; that is, if the image is viewed from different positions, it will appear to move along with the ﬁnger.
Use this method to locate the image formed by a lens. Explain why the method works.

Galileo devised a simple terrestrial telescope that produces an upright image. It consists of a converging objective lens and a diverging eyepiece at opposite ends of

aperture diameter of 200 mm and a focal length of
2 000 mm. It captures the image of a nebula on photographic ﬁlm at its prime focus with an exposure time of
1.50 min. To produce the same light energy per unit
area on the ﬁlm, what is the required exposure time to

Each point on the object is a source of rays that travel in

make everything that is viewed through them look
larger.

height and its lateral magniﬁcation also are inﬁnite. The
angular magniﬁcation of a telescope as we deﬁne it is
the factor by which the telescope increases in the diameter — on the retina of the viewer’s eye — of the real image of an extended object.

CHAPTER 37

Interference of Light Waves

I

n the preceding chapter on geometric optics, we used light rays to examine
what happens when light passes through a lens or reﬂects from a mirror. Here
in Chapter 37 and in the next chapter, we are concerned with wave optics, the
study of interference, diffraction, and polarization of light. These phenomena cannot be adequately explained with the ray optics used in Chapter 36. We now learn
how treating light as waves rather than as rays leads to a satisfying description of
such phenomena.

37.1

CONDITIONS FOR INTERFERENCE

In Chapter 18, we found that the adding together of two mechanical waves can be
constructive or destructive. In constructive interference, the amplitude of the resultant wave is greater than that of either individual wave, whereas in destructive
interference, the resultant amplitude is less than that of either individual wave.
Light waves also interfere with each other. Fundamentally, all interference associated with light waves arises when the electromagnetic ﬁelds that constitute the individual waves combine.
If two lightbulbs are placed side by side, no interference effects are observed
because the light waves from one bulb are emitted independently of those from
the other bulb. The emissions from the two lightbulbs do not maintain a constant
phase relationship with each other over time. Light waves from an ordinary source
such as a lightbulb undergo random changes about once every 10⫺8 s. Therefore,
the conditions for constructive interference, destructive interference, or some intermediate state last for lengths of time of the order of 10⫺8 s. Because the eye
cannot follow such short-term changes, no interference effects are observed. (In
1993 interference from two separate light sources was photographed in an extremely fast exposure. Nonetheless, we do not ordinarily see interference effects
because of the rapidly changing phase relationship between the light waves.) Such
light sources are said to be incoherent.
Interference effects in light waves are not easy to observe because of the short
wavelengths involved (from 4 ⫻ 10⫺7 m to 7 ⫻ 10⫺7 m). For sustained interference in light waves to be observed, the following conditions must be met:
Conditions for interference

• The sources must be coherent — that is, they must maintain a constant phase

with respect to each other.
• The sources should be monochromatic — that is, of a single wavelength.

We now describe the characteristics of coherent sources. As we saw when we
studied mechanical waves, two sources (producing two traveling waves) are
needed to create interference. In order to produce a stable interference pattern,
the individual waves must maintain a constant phase relationship with one
another. As an example, the sound waves emitted by two side-by-side loudspeakers
driven by a single ampliﬁer can interfere with each other because the two speakers
are coherent — that is, they respond to the ampliﬁer in the same way at the same
time.
A common method for producing two coherent light sources is to use one
monochromatic source to illuminate a barrier containing two small openings (usually in the shape of slits). The light emerging from the two slits is coherent because
a single source produces the original light beam and the two slits serve only to separate the original beam into two parts (which, after all, is what was done to the
sound signal from the side-by-side loudspeakers). Any random change in the light

37.2 Young’s Double-Slit Experiment

1187

emitted by the source occurs in both beams at the same time, and as a result interference effects can be observed when the light from the two slits arrives at a viewing screen.

YOUNG’S DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT

37.2

Interference in light waves from two sources was first demonstrated by Thomas
Young in 1801. A schematic diagram of the apparatus that Young used is shown
in Figure 37.1a. Light is incident on a first barrier in which there is a slit S0 .
The waves emerging from this slit arrive at a second barrier that contains two
parallel slits S 1 and S 2 . These two slits serve as a pair of coherent light sources
because waves emerging from them originate from the same wave front and
therefore maintain a constant phase relationship. The light from S 1 and S 2 produces on a viewing screen a visible pattern of bright and dark parallel bands
called fringes (Fig. 37.1b). When the light from S 1 and that from S 2 both arrive
at a point on the screen such that constructive interference occurs at that location, a bright fringe appears. When the light from the two slits combines destructively at any location on the screen, a dark fringe results. Figure 37.2 is a
photograph of an interference pattern produced by two coherent vibrating
sources in a water tank.

Look through the fabric of an umbrella at a distant streetlight. Can you
explain what you see? (The fringe
pattern in Figure 37.1b is from rectangular slits. The fabric of the umbrella creates a two-dimensional set of
square holes.)

Figure 37.2 is an overhead view of a shallow water tank. If you wanted to use a small ruler to
measure the water’s depth, would this be easier to do at location A or at location B?

Figure 37.3 shows some of the ways in which two waves can combine at the
screen. In Figure 37.3a, the two waves, which leave the two slits in phase, strike the
screen at the central point P. Because both waves travel the same distance, they arrive at P in phase. As a result, constructive interference occurs at this location, and
a bright fringe is observed. In Figure 37.3b, the two waves also start in phase, but
in this case the upper wave has to travel one wavelength farther than the lower
wave to reach point Q . Because the upper wave falls behind the lower one by exactly one wavelength, they still arrive in phase at Q , and so a second bright fringe
appears at this location. At point R in Figure 37.3c, however, midway between
points P and Q , the upper wave has fallen half a wavelength behind the lower
wave. This means that a trough of the lower wave overlaps a crest of the upper
wave; this gives rise to destructive interference at point R. For this reason, a dark
fringe is observed at this location.
We can describe Young’s experiment quantitatively with the help of Figure
37.4. The viewing screen is located a perpendicular distance L from the doubleslitted barrier. S 1 and S 2 are separated by a distance d, and the source is monochromatic. To reach any arbitrary point P, a wave from the lower slit travels farther
than a wave from the upper slit by a distance d sin ␪. This distance is called the
path difference ␦ (lowercase Greek delta). If we assume that r 1 and r 2 are parallel, which is approximately true because L is much greater than d, then ␦ is given

The value of ␦ determines whether the two waves are in phase when they arrive at
point P. If ␦ is either zero or some integer multiple of the wavelength, then the
two waves are in phase at point P and constructive interference results. Therefore,
the condition for bright fringes, or constructive interference, at point P is

When ␦ is an odd multiple of ␭/2, the two waves arriving at point P are 180°

It is useful to obtain expressions for the positions of the bright and dark
fringes measured vertically from O to P. In addition to our assumption that
L W d , we assume that d W ␭. These can be valid assumptions because in practice
L is often of the order of 1 m, d a fraction of a millimeter, and ␭ a fraction of a micrometer for visible light. Under these conditions, ␪ is small; thus, we can use the
approximation sin ␪ ⬇ tan ␪. Then, from triangle OPQ in Figure 37.4, we see that
y ⫽ L tan ␪ ⬇ L sin ␪

As we demonstrate in Example 37.1, Young’s double-slit experiment provides a
method for measuring the wavelength of light. In fact, Young used this technique
to do just that. Additionally, the experiment gave the wave model of light a great
deal of credibility. It was inconceivable that particles of light coming through the
slits could cancel each other in a way that would explain the dark fringes.

INTENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOUBLE-SLIT
INTERFERENCE PATTERN

Note that the edges of the bright fringes in Figure 37.1b are fuzzy. So far we have
discussed the locations of only the centers of the bright and dark fringes on a distant screen. We now direct our attention to the intensity of the light at other
points between the positions of maximum constructive and destructive interference. In other words, we now calculate the distribution of light intensity associated
with the double-slit interference pattern.

1191

37.3 Intensity Distribution of the Double-Slit Interference Pattern

Again, suppose that the two slits represent coherent sources of sinusoidal
waves such that the two waves from the slits have the same angular frequency ␻
and a constant phase difference ␾. The total magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at
point P on the screen in Figure 37.5 is the vector superposition of the two waves.
Assuming that the two waves have the same amplitude E 0 , we can write the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at point P due to each wave separately as
E 1 ⫽ E 0 sin ␻t

E 2 ⫽ E 0 sin(␻t ⫹ ␾)

and

(37.7)

Although the waves are in phase at the slits, their phase difference ␾ at point P depends
on the path difference ␦ ⫽ r 2 ⫺ r 1 ⫽ d sin ␪. Because a path difference of ␭ (constructive interference) corresponds to a phase difference of 2␲ rad, we obtain the
ratio

(37.8)

This equation tells us precisely how the phase difference ␾ depends on the angle ␪
in Figure 37.4.
Using the superposition principle and Equation 37.7, we can obtain the magnitude of the resultant electric ﬁeld at point P :
E P ⫽ E 1 ⫹ E 2 ⫽ E 0[sin ␻t ⫹ sin(␻t ⫹ ␾)]

(37.9)

To simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric identity

冢 A ⫹2 B 冣 cos冢 A ⫺2 B 冣

sin A ⫹ sin B ⫽ 2 sin

Taking A ⫽ ␻t ⫹ ␾ and B ⫽ ␻t, we can write Equation 37.9 in the form

冢 ␾2 冣 sin冢␻t ⫹ ␾2 冣

E P ⫽ 2E 0 cos

(37.10)

This result indicates that the electric ﬁeld at point P has the same frequency ␻ as the
light at the slits, but that the amplitude of the ﬁeld is multiplied by the factor
2 cos(␾/2). To check the consistency of this result, note that if ␾ ⫽ 0, 2␲, 4␲, . . . ,
then the electric ﬁeld at point P is 2E 0 , corresponding to the condition for constructive interference. These values of ␾ are consistent with Equation 37.2 for constructive interference. Likewise, if ␾ ⫽ ␲, 3␲, 5␲, . . . , then the magnitude of
the electric ﬁeld at point P is zero; this is consistent with Equation 37.3 for destructive interference.
Finally, to obtain an expression for the light intensity at point P, recall from
Section 34.3 that the intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of the resultant electric ﬁeld magnitude at that point (Eq. 34.20). Using Equation 37.10, we can therefore
express the light intensity at point P as

冢 ␾2 冣 sin 冢␻t ⫹ ␾2 冣

Most light-detecting instruments measure time-averaged light intensity, and the
time-averaged value of sin2(␻ t ⫹ ␾/2) over one cycle is 12 . Therefore, we can write
the average light intensity at point P as

Constructive interference, which produces light intensity maxima, occurs
when the quantity ␲ dy/␭ L is an integral multiple of ␲, corresponding to y ⫽
( ␭ L/d )m. This is consistent with Equation 37.5.
A plot of light intensity versus d sin ␪ is given in Figure 37.6. Note that the interference pattern consists of equally spaced fringes of equal intensity. Remember,
however, that this result is valid only if the slit-to-screen distance L is much greater
than the slit separation, and only for small values of ␪.
We have seen that the interference phenomena arising from two sources depend on the relative phase of the waves at a given point. Furthermore, the phase
difference at a given point depends on the path difference between the two waves.
The resultant light intensity at a point is proportional to the square of the
resultant electric ﬁeld at that point. That is, the light intensity is proportional
to (E 1 ⫹ E 2 )2. It would be incorrect to calculate the light intensity by adding the
intensities of the individual waves. This procedure would give E 12 ⫹ E 22, which of
course is not the same as (E 1 ⫹ E 2 )2. Note, however, that (E 1 ⫹ E 2)2 has the same
average value as E 12 ⫹ E 22 when the time average is taken over all values of the

PHASOR ADDITION OF WAVES

In the preceding section, we combined two waves algebraically to obtain the resultant wave amplitude at some point on a screen. Unfortunately, this analytical procedure becomes cumbersome when we must add several wave amplitudes. Because
we shall eventually be interested in combining a large number of waves, we now
describe a graphical procedure for this purpose.
Let us again consider a sinusoidal wave whose electric ﬁeld component is
given by

(a)

E2

E0
ωt + φ
ω

E 1 ⫽ E 0 sin ␻t
where E 0 is the wave amplitude and ␻ is the angular frequency. This wave can be
represented graphically by a phasor of magnitude E 0 rotating about the origin
counterclockwise with an angular frequency ␻, as shown in Figure 37.7a. Note that
the phasor makes an angle ␻ t with the horizontal axis. The projection of the phasor on the vertical axis represents E 1 , the magnitude of the wave disturbance at
some time t. Hence, as the phasor rotates in a circle, the projection E 1 oscillates
along the vertical axis about the origin.
Now consider a second sinusoidal wave whose electric ﬁeld component is
given by

ER

This wave has the same amplitude and frequency as E 1 , but its phase is ␾ with respect to E 1 . The phasor representing E 2 is shown in Figure 37.7b. We can obtain
the resultant wave, which is the sum of E 1 and E 2 , graphically by redrawing the
phasors as shown in Figure 37.7c, in which the tail of the second phasor is placed
at the tip of the ﬁrst. As with vector addition, the resultant phasor ER runs from
the tail of the ﬁrst phasor to the tip of the second. Furthermore, ER rotates along
with the two individual phasors at the same angular frequency ␻. The projection
of ER along the vertical axis equals the sum of the projections of the two other
phasors: E P ⫽ E 1 ⫹ E 2 .
It is convenient to construct the phasors at t ⫽ 0 as in Figure 37.8. From the
geometry of one of the right triangles, we see that

This is consistent with the result obtained algebraically, Equation 37.10. The resultant phasor has an amplitude 2E 0 cos(␾ /2) and makes an angle ␾ /2 with the ﬁrst
phasor. Furthermore, the average light intensity at point P, which varies as E P2, is
proportional to cos2(␾ /2), as described in Equation 37.11.
We can now describe how to obtain the resultant of several waves that have the
same frequency:
• Represent the waves by phasors, as shown in Figure 37.9, remembering to main-

tain the proper phase relationship between one phasor and the next.

The phasor ER is the
resultant of four phasors of equal

with respect to the ﬁrst phasor is ␣.

• The resultant phasor ER is the vector sum of the individual phasors. At each

instant, the projection of ER along the vertical axis represents the time variation of the resultant wave. The phase angle ␣ of the resultant wave is the
angle between ER and the first phasor. From Figure 37.9, drawn for four phasors, we see that the phasor of the resultant wave is given by the expression
E P ⫽ E R sin(␻t ⫹ ␣).

Phasor Diagrams for Two Coherent Sources
As an example of the phasor method, consider the interference pattern produced
by two coherent sources. Figure 37.10 represents the phasor diagrams for various
values of the phase difference ␾ and the corresponding values of the path difference ␦, which are obtained from Equation 37.8. The light intensity at a point is a
maximum when ER is a maximum; this occurs at ␾ ⫽ 0, 2␲, 4␲, . . . . The light
intensity at some point is zero when ER is zero; this occurs at ␾ ⫽ ␲, 3␲, 5␲, . . . .
These results are in complete agreement with the analytical procedure described
in the preceding section.

37.4 Phasor Addition of Waves

Three-Slit Interference Pattern
Using phasor diagrams, let us analyze the interference pattern caused by three
equally spaced slits. We can express the electric ﬁeld components at a point P on
the screen caused by waves from the individual slits as
E 1 ⫽ E 0 sin ␻t
E 2 ⫽ E 0 sin(␻t ⫹ ␾)
E 3 ⫽ E 0 sin(␻t ⫹ 2␾)
where ␾ is the phase difference between waves from adjacent slits. We can obtain
the resultant magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at point P from the phasor diagram in
Figure 37.11.
The phasor diagrams for various values of ␾ are shown in Figure 37.12. Note
that the resultant magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at P has a maximum value of 3E 0 ,
a condition that occurs when ␾ ⫽ 0, ⫾ 2␲, ⫾ 4␲, . . . . These points are called
primary maxima. Such primary maxima occur whenever the three phasors are
aligned as shown in Figure 37.12a. We also ﬁnd secondary maxima of amplitude
E 0 occurring between the primary maxima at points where ␾ ⫽ ⫾ ␲, ⫾ 3␲, . . . .
For these points, the wave from one slit exactly cancels that from another slit (Fig.
37.12d). This means that only light from the third slit contributes to the resultant,
which consequently has a total amplitude of E 0 . Total destructive interference occurs whenever the three phasors form a closed triangle, as shown in Figure 37.12c.
These points where E R ⫽ 0 correspond to ␾ ⫽ ⫾ 2␲/3, ⫾ 4␲/3, . . . . You
should be able to construct other phasor diagrams for values of ␾ greater than ␲.
Figure 37.13 shows multiple-slit interference patterns for a number of conﬁgurations. For three slits, note that the primary maxima are nine times more intense
than the secondary maxima as measured by the height of the curve. This is because the intensity varies as E R2. For N slits, the intensity of the primary maxima is
N 2 times greater than that due to a single slit. As the number of slits increases, the
primary maxima increase in intensity and become narrower, while the secondary
maxima decrease in intensity relative to the primary maxima. Figure 37.13 also
shows that as the number of slits increases, the number of secondary maxima also
increases. In fact, the number of secondary maxima is always N ⫺ 2, where N is
the number of slits.

CHANGE OF PHASE DUE TO REFLECTION

Young’s method for producing two coherent light sources involves illuminating
a pair of slits with a single source. Another simple, yet ingenious, arrangement
for producing an interference pattern with a single light source is known as
Lloyd’s mirror (Fig. 37.14). A light source is placed at point S close to a mirror,
and a viewing screen is positioned some distance away at right angles to the
mirror. Light waves can reach point P on the screen either by the direct path
SP or by the path involving reflection from the mirror. The reflected ray can be
treated as a ray originating from a virtual source at point S⬘. As a result, we can
think of this arrangement as a double-slit source with the distance between

1197

37.5 Change of Phase Due to Reflection

points S and S⬘ comparable to length d in Figure 37.4. Hence, at observation
points far from the source (L W d ), we expect waves from points S and S⬘ to
form an interference pattern just like the one we see from two real coherent
sources. An interference pattern is indeed observed. However, the positions of
the dark and bright fringes are reversed relative to the pattern created by two
real coherent sources (Young’s experiment). This is because the coherent
sources at points S and S⬘ differ in phase by 180°, a phase change produced by
reflection.
To illustrate this further, consider point P⬘, the point where the mirror intersects the screen. This point is equidistant from points S and S⬘. If path difference
alone were responsible for the phase difference, we would see a bright fringe at
point P⬘ (because the path difference is zero for this point), corresponding to the
central bright fringe of the two-slit interference pattern. Instead, we observe a
dark fringe at point P⬘ because of the 180° phase change produced by reﬂection.
In general,
an electromagnetic wave undergoes a phase change of 180° upon reﬂection
from a medium that has a higher index of refraction than the one in which the
wave is traveling.
It is useful to draw an analogy between reﬂected light waves and the reﬂections of a transverse wave pulse on a stretched string (see Section 16.6). The reﬂected pulse on a string undergoes a phase change of 180° when reﬂected from
the boundary of a denser medium, but no phase change occurs when the pulse is
reﬂected from the boundary of a less dense medium. Similarly, an electromagnetic
wave undergoes a 180° phase change when reﬂected from a boundary leading to
an optically denser medium, but no phase change occurs when the wave is reﬂected from a boundary leading to a less dense medium. These rules, summarized
in Figure 37.15, can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations, but the treatment is
beyond the scope of this text.

Interference of Light Waves

INTERFERENCE IN THIN FILMS

Interference effects are commonly observed in thin ﬁlms, such as thin layers of oil
on water or the thin surface of a soap bubble. The varied colors observed when
white light is incident on such ﬁlms result from the interference of waves reﬂected
from the two surfaces of the ﬁlm.
Consider a ﬁlm of uniform thickness t and index of refraction n, as shown in
Figure 37.16. Let us assume that the light rays traveling in air are nearly normal to
the two surfaces of the ﬁlm. To determine whether the reﬂected rays interfere
constructively or destructively, we ﬁrst note the following facts:
• A wave traveling from a medium of index of refraction n 1 toward a medium of

index of refraction n 2 undergoes a 180° phase change upon reﬂection when
n 2 ⬎ n 1 and undergoes no phase change if n 2 ⬍ n 1 .
• The wavelength of light ␭n in a medium whose refraction index is n (see Section
35.5) is

surfaces of the ﬁlm.

(37.14)

where ␭ is the wavelength of the light in free space.
Let us apply these rules to the ﬁlm of Figure 37.16, where n film ⬎ n air . Reﬂected ray 1, which is reﬂected from the upper surface (A), undergoes a phase
change of 180° with respect to the incident wave. Reﬂected ray 2, which is reﬂected from the lower ﬁlm surface (B), undergoes no phase change because it is
reﬂected from a medium (air) that has a lower index of refraction. Therefore, ray
1 is 180° out of phase with ray 2, which is equivalent to a path difference of ␭n /2.

Interference in soap bubbles. The colors are
due to interference between light rays reflected
from the front and back surfaces of the thin
film of soap making up the bubble. The color
depends on the thickness of the film, ranging
from black where the film is thinnest to
red where it is thickest.

The brilliant colors in a peacock’s feathers are
due to interference. The multilayer structure of
the feathers causes constructive interference for
certain colors, such as blue and green. The colors change as you view a peacock’s feathers from
different angles. Iridescent colors of butterﬂies
and hummingbirds are the result of similar interference effects.

1199

37.6 Interference in Thin Films

However, we must also consider that ray 2 travels an extra distance 2t before the
waves recombine in the air above surface A. If 2t ⫽ ␭ n /2, then rays 1 and 2 recombine in phase, and the result is constructive interference. In general, the condition
for constructive interference in such situations is
2t ⫽ (m ⫹ 12 )␭ n

m ⫽ 0, 1, 2, . . .

(37.15)

This condition takes into account two factors: (1) the difference in path length for
the two rays (the term m ␭ n ) and (2) the 180° phase change upon reﬂection (the
term ␭ n /2). Because ␭ n ⫽ ␭/n, we can write Equation 37.15 as
2nt ⫽ (m ⫹ 12 )␭

m ⫽ 0, 1, 2, . . .

(37.16)

Conditions for constructive
interference in thin ﬁlms

If the extra distance 2t traveled by ray 2 corresponds to a multiple of ␭ n , then
the two waves combine out of phase, and the result is destructive interference. The
general equation for destructive interference is
2nt ⫽ m␭

m ⫽ 0, 1, 2, . . .

(37.17)

Conditions for destructive
interference in thin ﬁlms

The foregoing conditions for constructive and destructive interference are
valid when the medium above the top surface of the film is the same as the
medium below the bottom surface. The medium surrounding the film may have
a refractive index less than or greater than that of the film. In either case, the
rays reflected from the two surfaces are out of phase by 180°. If the film
is placed between two different media, one with n ⬍ n film and the other with
n ⬎ n film , then the conditions for constructive and destructive interference are
reversed. In this case, either there is a phase change of 180° for both ray 1 reflecting from surface A and ray 2 reflecting from surface B, or there is no phase
change for either ray; hence, the net change in relative phase due to the reflections is zero.

Newton’s Rings
Another method for observing interference in light waves is to place a planoconvex lens on top of a ﬂat glass surface, as shown in Figure 37.18a. With this
arrangement, the air ﬁlm between the glass surfaces varies in thickness from zero
at the point of contact to some value t at point P. If the radius of curvature R of
the lens is much greater than the distance r, and if the system is viewed from above
using light of a single wavelength ␭, a pattern of light and dark rings is observed,
as shown in Figure 37.18b. These circular fringes, discovered by Newton, are called
Newton’s rings.
The interference effect is due to the combination of ray 1, reﬂected from the
ﬂat plate, with ray 2, reﬂected from the curved surface of the lens. Ray 1 undergoes a phase change of 180° upon reﬂection (because it is reﬂected from a
medium of higher refractive index), whereas ray 2 undergoes no phase change
(because it is reﬂected from a medium of lower refractive index). Hence, the conditions for constructive and destructive interference are given by Equations 37.16
and 37.17, respectively, with n ⫽ 1 because the ﬁlm is air.
The contact point at O is dark, as seen in Figure 37.18b, because ray 1 undergoes a 180° phase change upon external reﬂection (from the ﬂat surface); in con-

Observe the colors appearing to swirl

do you see just before a bubble

trast, ray 2 undergoes no phase change upon internal reﬂection (from the curved
surface).
Using the geometry shown in Figure 37.18a, we can obtain expressions for the
radii of the bright and dark bands in terms of the radius of curvature R and wavelength ␭ . For example, the dark rings have radii given by the expression
r ⬇ !m␭R/n. The details are left as a problem for you to solve (see Problem 67).
We can obtain the wavelength of the light causing the interference pattern by
measuring the radii of the rings, provided R is known. Conversely, we can use a
known wavelength to obtain R .
One important use of Newton’s rings is in the testing of optical lenses. A
circular pattern like that pictured in Figure 37.18b is obtained only when the
lens is ground to a perfectly symmetric curvature. Variations from such symmetry might produce a pattern like that shown in Figure 37.19. These variations indicate how the lens must be reground and repolished to remove the
imperfections.

Problem-Solving Hints
Thin-Film Interference
You should keep the following ideas in mind when you work thin-ﬁlm interference problems:
• Identify the thin ﬁlm causing the interference.
• The type of interference that occurs is determined by the phase relationship
between the portion of the wave reﬂected at the upper surface of the ﬁlm
and the portion reﬂected at the lower surface.
• Phase differences between the two portions of the wave have two causes: (1)
differences in the distances traveled by the two portions and (2) phase
changes that may occur upon reﬂection.
• When the distance traveled and phase changes upon reﬂection are both
taken into account, the interference is constructive if the equivalent path
difference between the two waves is an integral multiple of ␭, and it is destructive if the path difference is ␭/2, 3␭/2, 5␭/2, and so forth.

What other ﬁlm thicknesses produce constructive

Answer

Nonreﬂective Coatings for Solar Cells

Solar cells — devices that generate electricity when exposed
to sunlight — are often coated with a transparent, thin ﬁlm of
silicon monoxide (SiO, n ⫽ 1.45) to minimize reﬂective
losses from the surface. Suppose that a silicon solar cell
(n ⫽ 3.5) is coated with a thin ﬁlm of silicon monoxide for
this purpose (Fig. 37.20). Determine the minimum ﬁlm
thickness that produces the least reﬂection at a wavelength of
550 nm, near the center of the visible spectrum.

Solution The reﬂected light is a minimum when rays 1
and 2 in Figure 37.20 meet the condition of destructive interference. Note that both rays undergo a 180° phase change
upon reﬂection — ray 1 from the upper SiO surface and ray 2
from the lower SiO surface. The net change in phase due to
reﬂection is therefore zero, and the condition for a reﬂection
minimum requires a path difference of ␭ n /2. Hence,

A typical uncoated solar cell has reﬂective losses as high as
30%; a SiO coating can reduce this value to about 10%. This
signiﬁcant decrease in reﬂective losses increases the cell’s efﬁciency because less reﬂection means that more sunlight enters the silicon to create charge carriers in the cell. No coating can ever be made perfectly nonreﬂecting because the
required thickness is wavelength-dependent and the incident
light covers a wide range of wavelengths.
Glass lenses used in cameras and other optical instruments are usually coated with a transparent thin ﬁlm to reduce or eliminate unwanted reﬂection and enhance the
transmission of light through the lenses.

Reﬂective losses from a silicon solar cell are minimized by coating the surface of the cell with a thin ﬁlm of silicon
monoxide.

This camera lens has several coatings (of different thicknesses)
that minimize reﬂection of light waves having wavelengths near
the center of the visible spectrum. As a result, the little light that
is reﬂected by the lens has a greater proportion of the far ends of
the spectrum and appears reddish-violet.

Interference in a Wedge-Shaped Film

A thin, wedge-shaped ﬁlm of refractive index n is illuminated
with monochromatic light of wavelength ␭ , as illustrated in
Figure 37.21a. Describe the interference pattern observed for
this case.

Solution The interference pattern, because it is created
by a thin ﬁlm of variable thickness surrounded by air, is a series of alternating bright and dark parallel fringes. A dark
fringe corresponding to destructive interference appears at
point O, the apex, because here the upper reﬂected ray undergoes a 180° phase change while the lower one undergoes
no phase change.
According to Equation 37.17, other dark minima appear
when 2nt ⫽ m␭; thus, t 1 ⫽ ␭/2n, t 2 ⫽ ␭/n, t 3 ⫽ 3␭/2n, and

THE MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER

The interferometer, invented by the American physicist A. A. Michelson
(1852 – 1931), splits a light beam into two parts and then recombines the parts to
form an interference pattern. The device can be used to measure wavelengths or
other lengths with great precision.
A schematic diagram of the interferometer is shown in Figure 37.22. A ray of
light from a monochromatic source is split into two rays by mirror M, which is inclined at 45° to the incident light beam. Mirror M, called a beam splitter, transmits
half the light incident on it and reﬂects the rest. One ray is reﬂected from M vertically upward toward mirror M 1 , and the second ray is transmitted horizontally
through M toward mirror M 2 . Hence, the two rays travel separate paths L 1 and L 2 .
After reﬂecting from M 1 and M 2 , the two rays eventually recombine at M to produce an interference pattern, which can be viewed through a telescope. The glass
plate P, equal in thickness to mirror M, is placed in the path of the horizontal ray
to ensure that the two returning rays travel the same thickness of glass.

Figure 37.22

Diagram of the Michelson interferometer. A single ray of light is split into two
rays by mirror M, which is called a beam splitter. The path difference between the two rays is varied with the adjustable mirror M 1 . As M 1 is moved toward M, an interference pattern moves
across the ﬁeld of view.

The interference condition for the two rays is determined by their path length
differences. When the two rays are viewed as shown, the image of M 2 produced by
the mirror M is at M⬘2 , which is nearly parallel to M 1 . (Because M 1 and M 2 are not
exactly perpendicular to each other, the image M⬘2 is at a slight angle to M 1 .)
Hence, the space between M⬘2 and M 1 is the equivalent of a wedge-shaped air ﬁlm.
The effective thickness of the air ﬁlm is varied by moving mirror M 1 parallel to itself with a ﬁnely threaded screw adjustment. Under these conditions, the interference pattern is a series of bright and dark parallel fringes as described in Example
37.5. As M 1 is moved, the fringe pattern shifts. For example, if a dark fringe appears in the ﬁeld of view (corresponding to destructive interference) and M 1 is
then moved a distance ␭/4 toward M, the path difference changes by ␭/2 (twice
the separation between M 1 and M⬘2). What was a dark fringe now becomes a bright
fringe. As M 1 is moved an additional distance ␭/4 toward M, the bright fringe becomes a dark fringe. Thus, the fringe pattern shifts by one-half fringe each time
M 1 is moved a distance ␭/4. The wavelength of light is then measured by counting
the number of fringe shifts for a given displacement of M 1 . If the wavelength is accurately known (as with a laser beam), mirror displacements can be measured to
within a fraction of the wavelength.

Interference of Light Waves

SUMMARY
Interference in light waves occurs whenever two or more waves overlap at a given
point. A sustained interference pattern is observed if (1) the sources are coherent
and (2) the sources have identical wavelengths.
In Young’s double-slit experiment, two slits S1 and S 2 separated by a distance d
are illuminated by a single-wavelength light source. An interference pattern consisting of bright and dark fringes is observed on a viewing screen. The condition
for bright fringes (constructive interference) is

The condition for dark fringes (destructive interference) is
d sin ␪ ⫽ (m ⫹ 12 )␭

m ⫽ 0, ⫾ 1, ⫾ 2, . . .

(37.3)

The number m is called the order number of the fringe.

where I max is the maximum intensity on the screen and the expression represents
the time average.
A wave traveling from a medium of index of refraction n 1 toward a medium of
index of refraction n 2 undergoes a 180° phase change upon reﬂection when
n 2 ⬎ n 1 and undergoes no phase change when n 2 ⬍ n 1 .

QUESTIONS
1. What is the necessary condition on the path length difference between two waves that interfere (a) constructively
and (b) destructively?
2. Explain why two ﬂashlights held close together do not
produce an interference pattern on a distant screen.
3. If Young’s double-slit experiment were performed under
water, how would the observed interference pattern be affected?
4. In Young’s double-slit experiment, why do we use monochromatic light? If white light is used, how would the pattern change?
5. Consider a dark fringe in an interference pattern, at
which almost no light is arriving. Light from both slits is
arriving at this point, but the waves are canceling. Where
does the energy go?
6. An oil ﬁlm on water appears brightest at the outer regions, where it is thinnest. From this information, what
can you say about the index of refraction of oil relative to
that of water?

7. In our discussion of thin-ﬁlm interference, we looked at
light reﬂecting from a thin ﬁlm. Consider one light ray, the
direct ray, that transmits through the ﬁlm without reﬂecting. Consider a second ray, the reﬂected ray, that transmits through the ﬁrst surface, reﬂects from the second,
reﬂects again from the ﬁrst, and then transmits out into
the air, parallel to the direct ray. For normal incidence,
how thick must the ﬁlm be, in terms of the wavelength of
light, for the outgoing rays to interfere destructively? Is it
the same thickness as for reﬂected destructive interference?
8. Suppose that you are watching television connected to an
antenna rather than a cable system. If an airplane ﬂies
near your location, you may notice wavering ghost images
in the television picture. What might cause this?
9. If we are to observe interference in a thin ﬁlm, why must
the ﬁlm not be very thick (on the order of a few wavelengths)?

hen light waves pass through a small aperture, an interference pattern is
observed rather than a sharp spot of light. This behavior indicates that light,
once it has passed through the aperture, spreads beyond the narrow path deﬁned by the aperture into regions that would be in shadow if light traveled in
straight lines. Other waves, such as sound waves and water waves, also have this
property of spreading when passing through apertures or by sharp edges. This
phenomenon, known as diffraction, can be described only with a wave model for
light.
In Chapter 34, we learned that electromagnetic waves are transverse. That is,
the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors are perpendicular to the direction of wave
propagation. In this chapter, we see that under certain conditions these transverse
waves can be polarized in various ways.

INTRODUCTION TO DIFFRACTION

In Section 37.2 we learned that an interference pattern is observed on a viewing
screen when two slits are illuminated by a single-wavelength light source. If the
light traveled only in its original direction after passing through the slits, as
shown in Figure 38.1a, the waves would not overlap and no interference pattern
would be seen. Instead, Huygens’s principle requires that the waves spread out
from the slits as shown in Figure 38.1b. In other words, the light deviates from a
straight-line path and enters the region that would otherwise be shadowed. As
noted in Section 35.1, this divergence of light from its initial line of travel is
called diffraction.
In general, diffraction occurs when waves pass through small openings,
around obstacles, or past sharp edges, as shown in Figure 38.2. When an opaque
object is placed between a point source of light and a screen, no sharp boundary
exists on the screen between a shadowed region and an illuminated region. The illuminated region above the shadow of the object contains alternating light and
dark fringes. Such a display is called a diffraction pattern.
Figure 38.3 shows a diffraction pattern associated with the shadow of a penny.
A bright spot occurs at the center, and circular fringes extend outward from the
shadow’s edge. We can explain the central bright spot only by using the wave theViewing

Opaque object

Figure 38.2 Light from a small source passes by the edge of an opaque object. We might expect no light to appear on the screen below the position of the edge of the object. In reality, light
bends around the top edge of the object and enters this region. Because of these effects, a diffraction pattern consisting of bright and dark fringes appears in the region above the edge of the
object.

ory of light, which predicts constructive interference at this point. From the viewpoint of geometric optics (in which light is viewed as rays traveling in straight
lines), we expect the center of the shadow to be dark because that part of the viewing screen is completely shielded by the penny.
It is interesting to point out an historical incident that occurred shortly before
the central bright spot was ﬁrst observed. One of the supporters of geometric optics, Simeon Poisson, argued that if Augustin Fresnel’s wave theory of light were
valid, then a central bright spot should be observed in the shadow of a circular object illuminated by a point source of light. To Poisson’s astonishment, the spot was
observed by Dominique Arago shortly thereafter. Thus, Poisson’s prediction reinforced the wave theory rather than disproving it.
In this chapter we restrict our attention to Fraunhofer diffraction, which occurs, for example, when all the rays passing through a narrow slit are approximately parallel to one another. This can be achieved experimentally either by placing the screen far from the opening used to create the diffraction or by using a
converging lens to focus the rays once they pass through the opening, as shown in
Figure 38.4a. A bright fringe is observed along the axis at ␪ ⫽ 0, with alternating
dark and bright fringes occurring on either side of the central bright one. Figure
38.4b is a photograph of a single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.

Diffraction and Polarization

DIFFRACTION FROM NARROW SLITS

Until now, we have assumed that slits are point sources of light. In this section, we
abandon that assumption and see how the ﬁnite width of slits is the basis for understanding Fraunhofer diffraction.
We can deduce some important features of this phenomenon by examining
waves coming from various portions of the slit, as shown in Figure 38.5. According
to Huygens’s principle, each portion of the slit acts as a source of light waves.
Hence, light from one portion of the slit can interfere with light from another
portion, and the resultant light intensity on a viewing screen depends on the direction ␪.
To analyze the diffraction pattern, it is convenient to divide the slit into two
halves, as shown in Figure 38.5. Keeping in mind that all the waves are in phase
as they leave the slit, consider rays 1 and 3. As these two rays travel toward a viewing screen far to the right of the figure, ray 1 travels farther than ray 3 by an
amount equal to the path difference (a /2) sin ␪, where a is the width of the slit.
Similarly, the path difference between rays 2 and 4 is also (a /2) sin ␪. If this path
difference is exactly half a wavelength (corresponding to a phase difference of
180°), then the two waves cancel each other and destructive interference results.
This is true for any two rays that originate at points separated by half the slit
width because the phase difference between two such points is 180°. Therefore,
waves from the upper half of the slit interfere destructively with waves from the
lower half when

ﬁngers. Hold your hand up very close
to your eye so that you are looking
between your two ﬁngers toward a
bright area. Now bring the ﬁngers together until there is only a very tiny
slit between them. You should be able
to see a series of parallel lines. Although the lines appear to be located
in the narrow space between your ﬁngers, what you are actually seeing is a
diffraction pattern cast upon your
retina.

Figure 38.7 Fraunhofer diffraction by a single slit. The light intensity at point P is the resultant of all
the incremental electric ﬁeld magnitudes from zones of width ⌬y.

and each contributes an incremental electric ﬁeld of magnitude ⌬E at some point
P on the screen. We obtain the total electric ﬁeld magnitude E at point P by summing the contributions from all the zones. The light intensity at point P is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld (see Section 37.3).
The incremental electric ﬁeld magnitudes between adjacent zones are out of
phase with one another by an amount ⌬ ␤, where the phase difference ⌬ ␤ is related to the path difference ⌬y sin ␪ between adjacent zones by the expression

To ﬁnd the magnitude of the total electric ﬁeld on the screen at any angle ␪,
we sum the incremental magnitudes ⌬E due to each zone. For small values of ␪, we
can assume that all the ⌬E values are the same. It is convenient to use phasor diagrams for various angles, as shown in Figure 38.8. When ␪ ⫽ 0, all phasors are
aligned as shown in Figure 38.8a because all the waves from the various zones are
in phase. In this case, the total electric ﬁeld at the center of the screen is E 0 ⫽

As ␪ increases, the chain of phasors eventually forms the closed path shown in

That is, the ﬁrst minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs where sin ␪ ⫽ ␭/a; this
is in agreement with Equation 38.1.
At greater values of ␪, the spiral chain of phasors tightens. For example, Figure 38.8d represents the situation corresponding to the second maximum, which
occurs when ␤ ⫽ 360° ⫹ 180° ⫽ 540° (3␲ rad). The second minimum (two complete circles, not shown) corresponds to ␤ ⫽ 720° (4␲ rad), which satisﬁes the

We can obtain the total electric ﬁeld magnitude ER and light intensity I at any
point P on the screen in Figure 38.7 by considering the limiting case in which ⌬y
becomes inﬁnitesimal (dy) and N approaches ⬁. In this limit, the phasor chains in
Figure 38.8 become the red curve of Figure 38.9. The arc length of the curve is E 0
because it is the sum of the magnitudes of the phasors (which is the total electric
ﬁeld magnitude at the center of the screen). From this ﬁgure, we see that at some

Intensity of Two-Slit Diffraction Patterns
When more than one slit is present, we must consider not only diffraction due to
the individual slits but also the interference of the waves coming from different
slits. You may have noticed the curved dashed line in Figure 37.13, which indicates
a decrease in intensity of the interference maxima as ␪ increases. This decrease is

we simply combine Equation 37.12 and Equation 38.5:

Although this formula looks complicated, it merely represents the diffraction pattern (the factor in brackets) acting as an “envelope” for a two-slit interference pattern (the cosine-squared factor), as shown in Figure 38.11.
Equation 37.2 indicates the conditions for interference maxima as d sin ␪ ⫽ m␭,
where d is the distance between the two slits. Equation 38.1 speciﬁes that the ﬁrst
diffraction minimum occurs when a sin ␪ ⫽ ␭, where a is the slit width. Dividing
Equation 37.2 by Equation 38.1 (with m ⫽ 1) allows us to determine which interference maximum coincides with the ﬁrst diffraction minimum:

RESOLUTION OF SINGLE-SLIT AND
CIRCULAR APERTURES

38.3

The ability of optical systems to distinguish between closely spaced objects is limited because of the wave nature of light. To understand this difﬁculty, let us consider Figure 38.12, which shows two light sources far from a narrow slit of width a.
The sources can be considered as two noncoherent point sources S1 and S 2 — for
example, they could be two distant stars. If no diffraction occurred, two distinct
bright spots (or images) would be observed on the viewing screen. However, because of diffraction, each source is imaged as a bright central region ﬂanked by
weaker bright and dark fringes. What is observed on the screen is the sum of two
diffraction patterns: one from S1 , and the other from S 2 .
If the two sources are far enough apart to keep their central maxima from
overlapping, as shown in Figure 38.12a, their images can be distinguished and are
said to be resolved. If the sources are close together, however, as shown in Figure
38.12b, the two central maxima overlap, and the images are not resolved. In determining whether two images are resolved, the following condition is often used:
When the central maximum of one image falls on the ﬁrst minimum of the
other image, the images are said to be just resolved. This limiting condition of
resolution is known as Rayleigh’s criterion.
Figure 38.13 shows diffraction patterns for three situations. When the objects
are far apart, their images are well resolved (Fig. 38.13a). When the angular sepa-

that the patterns are not resolved.

ration of the objects satisﬁes Rayleigh’s criterion (Fig. 38.13b), the images are just
resolved. Finally, when the objects are close together, the images are not resolved
(Fig. 38.13c).
From Rayleigh’s criterion, we can determine the minimum angular separation
␪ min subtended by the sources at the slit for which the images are just resolved.
Equation 38.1 indicates that the ﬁrst minimum in a single-slit diffraction pattern
occurs at the angle for which
␭

where a is the width of the slit. According to Rayleigh’s criterion, this expression
gives the smallest angular separation for which the two images are resolved. Because ␭ V a in most situations, sin ␪ is small, and we can use the approximation
sin ␪ ⬇ ␪. Therefore, the limiting angle of resolution for a slit of width a is

speaker, of intermediate diameter, is used for the frequency
band above the high-frequency cutoff of the woofer and below the low-frequency cutoff of the tweeter. Circuits known as
crossover networks include low-pass, midrange, and high-pass
ﬁlters that direct the electrical signal to the appropriate
speaker. The effective aperture size of a speaker is approximately its diameter. Because the wavelengths of sound waves
are comparable to the typical sizes of the speakers, diffraction
effects determine the angular radiation pattern. To be most
useful, a speaker should radiate sound over a broad range of
angles so that the listener does not have to stand at a particular spot in the room to hear maximum sound intensity. On
the basis of the angular radiation pattern, let us investigate
the frequency range for which a 6-in. (0.15-m) midrange
speaker is most useful.
The speed of sound in air is 344 m/s, and for a circular aperture, diffraction effects become important when ␭ ⫽

angular proﬁles of sound intensity shown in Figure 38.17. In
examining these plots, we see that the dispersion pattern for
a 500-Hz sound is fairly uniform. This angular range is sufﬁ-

ciently great for us to say that this midrange speaker satisﬁes
the design criterion. The intensity of a 2 000-Hz sound decreases to about half its maximum value about 30° from the

THE DIFFRACTION GRATING

The diffraction grating, a useful device for analyzing light sources, consists of a
large number of equally spaced parallel slits. A transmission grating can be made by
cutting parallel lines on a glass plate with a precision ruling machine. The spaces
between the lines are transparent to the light and hence act as separate slits. A reﬂection grating can be made by cutting parallel lines on the surface of a reﬂective
material. The reﬂection of light from the spaces between the lines is specular, and
the reﬂection from the lines cut into the material is diffuse. Thus, the spaces between the lines act as parallel sources of reﬂected light, like the slits in a transmission grating. Gratings that have many lines very close to each other can have very
small slit spacings. For example, a grating ruled with 5 000 lines/cm has a slit spacing d ⫽ (1/5 000) cm ⫽ 2.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺4 cm.

between adjacent slits is d sin ␪.
A section of a diffraction grating is illustrated in Figure 38.18. A plane wave is
incident from the left, normal to the plane of the grating. A converging lens
brings the rays together at point P. The pattern observed on the screen is the result of the combined effects of interference and diffraction. Each slit produces diffraction, and the diffracted beams interfere with one another to produce the ﬁnal
pattern.
The waves from all slits are in phase as they leave the slits. However, for some
arbitrary direction ␪ measured from the horizontal, the waves must travel different
path lengths before reaching point P. From Figure 38.18, note that the path difference ␦ between rays from any two adjacent slits is equal to d sin ␪. If this path difference equals one wavelength or some integral multiple of a wavelength, then
waves from all slits are in phase at point P and a bright fringe is observed. Therefore, the condition for maxima in the interference pattern at the angle ␪ is
d sin ␪ ⫽ m␭

m ⫽ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .

(38.10)

We can use this expression to calculate the wavelength if we know the grating
spacing and the angle ␪. If the incident radiation contains several wavelengths, the
mth-order maximum for each wavelength occurs at a speciﬁc angle. All wavelengths are seen at ␪ ⫽ 0, corresponding to m ⫽ 0, the zeroth-order maximum.
The ﬁrst-order maximum (m ⫽ 1) is observed at an angle that satisﬁes the relationship sin ␪ ⫽ ␭/d; the second-order maximum (m ⫽ 2) is observed at a larger
angle ␪, and so on.
The intensity distribution for a diffraction grating obtained with the use of a
monochromatic source is shown in Figure 38.19. Note the sharpness of the principal maxima and the broadness of the dark areas. This is in contrast to the broad
bright fringes characteristic of the two-slit interference pattern (see Fig. 37.6). Because the principal maxima are so sharp, they are very much brighter than two-slit

the combination of multiple wave fronts for a ten-slit grating is compared with the

and therefore the maxima are even stronger.
A schematic drawing of a simple apparatus used to measure angles in a diffraction pattern is shown in Figure 38.21. This apparatus is a diffraction grating spectrometer. The light to be analyzed passes through a slit, and a collimated beam of
light is incident on the grating. The diffracted light leaves the grating at angles
that satisfy Equation 38.10, and a telescope is used to view the image of the slit.
The wavelength can be determined by measuring the precise angles at which the
images of the slit appear for the various orders.

38.4 The Diffraction Grating

CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 38.6

A Compact Disc Is a Diffraction Grating

Light reﬂected from the surface of a compact disc is multicolored, as shown in Figure 38.22. The colors and their intensities depend on the orientation of the disc relative to
the eye and relative to the light source. Explain how this
works.

Solution The surface of a compact disc has a spiral
grooved track (with adjacent grooves having a separation on
the order of 1 ␮m). Thus, the surface acts as a reﬂection grating. The light reﬂecting from the regions between these
closely spaced grooves interferes constructively only in certain directions that depend on the wavelength and on the direction of the incident light. Any one section of the disc
serves as a diffraction grating for white light, sending different colors in different directions. The different colors you
see when viewing one section change as the light source, the
disc, or you move to change the angles of incidence or diffraction.

EXAMPLE 38.7

is equal to the inverse of the number of lines per centimeter:

Hence, only zeroth-, ﬁrst-, and second-order maxima are observed for this situation.

Resolving Power of the Diffraction Grating
The diffraction grating is most useful for measuring wavelengths accurately. Like
the prism, the diffraction grating can be used to disperse a spectrum into its wavelength components. Of the two devices, the grating is the more precise if one
wants to distinguish two closely spaced wavelengths.
For two nearly equal wavelengths ␭ 1 and ␭ 2 between which a diffraction grating can just barely distinguish, the resolving power R of the grating is deﬁned as

where ␭ ⫽ (␭ 1 ⫹ ␭ 2)/2 and ⌬␭ ⫽ ␭ 2 ⫺ ␭ 1 . Thus, a grating that has a high resolving power can distinguish small differences in wavelength. If N lines of the grating

Resolving power of a grating

(38.12)

Thus, resolving power increases with increasing order number and with increasing

Note that R ⫽ 0 for m ⫽ 0; this signifies that all wavelengths are indistinguishable for the zeroth-order maximum. However, consider the second-order
diffraction pattern (m ⫽ 2) of a grating that has 5 000 rulings illuminated by
the light source. The resolving power of such a grating in second order is
R ⫽ 5 000 ⫻ 2 ⫽ 10 000. Therefore, for a mean wavelength of, for example,
600 nm, the minimum wavelength separation between two spectral lines that
can be just resolved is ⌬␭ ⫽ ␭ /R ⫽ 6.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺2 nm. For the third-order principal maximum, R ⫽ 15 000 and ⌬␭ ⫽ 4.00 ⫻ 10 ⫺2 nm, and so on.
One of the most interesting applications of diffraction is holography, which is
used to create three-dimensional images found practically everywhere, from credit
cards to postage stamps. The production of these special diffracting ﬁlms is discussed in Chapter 42 of the extended version of this text.

DIFFRACTION OF X-RAYS BY CRYSTALS

In principle, the wavelength of any electromagnetic wave can be determined if a
grating of the proper spacing (of the order of ␭ ) is available. X-rays, discovered by
Wilhelm Roentgen (1845 – 1923) in 1895, are electromagnetic waves of very short
wavelength (of the order of 0.1 nm). It would be impossible to construct a grating
having such a small spacing by the cutting process described at the beginning of
Section 38.4. However, the atomic spacing in a solid is known to be about 0.1 nm.
In 1913, Max von Laue (1879 – 1960) suggested that the regular array of atoms in a
crystal could act as a three-dimensional diffraction grating for x-rays. Subsequent
experiments conﬁrmed this prediction. The diffraction patterns are complex because of the three-dimensional nature of the crystal. Nevertheless, x-ray diffraction

1229

38.5 Diffraction of X-Rays by Crystals

has proved to be an invaluable technique for elucidating crystalline structures and
for understanding the structure of matter.1
Figure 38.23 is one experimental arrangement for observing x-ray diffraction
from a crystal. A collimated beam of x-rays is incident on a crystal. The diffracted
beams are very intense in certain directions, corresponding to constructive interference from waves reﬂected from layers of atoms in the crystal. The diffracted
beams can be detected by a photographic ﬁlm, and they form an array of spots
known as a Laue pattern. One can deduce the crystalline structure by analyzing the
positions and intensities of the various spots in the pattern.
The arrangement of atoms in a crystal of sodium chloride (NaCl) is shown in
Figure 38.24. Each unit cell (the geometric solid that repeats throughout the crystal) is a cube having an edge length a. A careful examination of the NaCl structure
shows that the ions lie in discrete planes (the shaded areas in Fig. 38.24). Now suppose that an incident x-ray beam makes an angle ␪ with one of the planes, as
shown in Figure 38.25. The beam can be reﬂected from both the upper plane and
the lower one. However, the beam reﬂected from the lower plane travels farther
than the beam reﬂected from the upper plane. The effective path difference is
2d sin ␪. The two beams reinforce each other (constructive interference) when
this path difference equals some integer multiple of ␭. The same is true for reﬂection from the entire family of parallel planes. Hence, the condition for constructive interference (maxima in the reﬂected beam) is

CHAPTER 38

Diffraction and Polarization

POLARIZATION OF LIGHT WAVES

38.6

In Chapter 34 we described the transverse nature of light and all other electromagnetic waves. Polarization is ﬁrm evidence of this transverse nature.
An ordinary beam of light consists of a large number of waves emitted by the
atoms of the light source. Each atom produces a wave having some particular orientation of the electric ﬁeld vector E, corresponding to the direction of atomic vibration. The direction of polarization of each individual wave is deﬁned to be the direction in which the electric ﬁeld is vibrating. In Figure 38.26, this direction
happens to lie along the y axis. However, an individual electromagnetic wave could
have its E vector in the yz plane, making any possible angle with the y axis. Because
all directions of vibration from a wave source are possible, the resultant electromagnetic wave is a superposition of waves vibrating in many different directions.
The result is an unpolarized light beam, represented in Figure 38.27a. The direction of wave propagation in this ﬁgure is perpendicular to the page. The arrows
show a few possible directions of the electric ﬁeld vectors for the individual waves
making up the resultant beam. At any given point and at some instant of time, all
these individual electric ﬁeld vectors add to give one resultant electric ﬁeld vector.
As noted in Section 34.2, a wave is said to be linearly polarized if the resultant electric ﬁeld E vibrates in the same direction at all times at a particular point,
as shown in Figure 38.27b. (Sometimes, such a wave is described as plane-polarized,
or simply polarized.) The plane formed by E and the direction of propagation is
called the plane of polarization of the wave. If the wave in Figure 38.26 represented
the resultant of all individual waves, the plane of polarization is the xy plane.
It is possible to obtain a linearly polarized beam from an unpolarized beam by
removing all waves from the beam except those whose electric ﬁeld vectors oscillate in a single plane. We now discuss four processes for producing polarized light
from unpolarized light.

Polarization by Selective Absorption
The most common technique for producing polarized light is to use a material
that transmits waves whose electric ﬁelds vibrate in a plane parallel to a certain direction and that absorbs waves whose electric ﬁelds vibrate in all other directions.
In 1938, E. H. Land (1909 – 1991) discovered a material, which he called polaroid, that polarizes light through selective absorption by oriented molecules. This
material is fabricated in thin sheets of long-chain hydrocarbons. The sheets are
stretched during manufacture so that the long-chain molecules align. After a sheet
is dipped into a solution containing iodine, the molecules become good electrical
conductors. However, conduction takes place primarily along the hydrocarbon
chains because electrons can move easily only along the chains. As a result, the

plane, and the magnetic ﬁeld vibrates in the xz
plane.

1231

38.6 Polarization of Light Waves

molecules readily absorb light whose electric ﬁeld vector is parallel to their length
and allow light through whose electric ﬁeld vector is perpendicular to their length.
It is common to refer to the direction perpendicular to the molecular chains
as the transmission axis. In an ideal polarizer, all light with E parallel to the transmission axis is transmitted, and all light with E perpendicular to the transmission
axis is absorbed.
Figure 38.28 represents an unpolarized light beam incident on a ﬁrst polarizing sheet, called the polarizer. Because the transmission axis is oriented vertically in
the ﬁgure, the light transmitted through this sheet is polarized vertically. A second
polarizing sheet, called the analyzer, intercepts the beam. In Figure 38.28, the analyzer transmission axis is set at an angle ␪ to the polarizer axis. We call the electric
ﬁeld vector of the transmitted beam E0 . The component of E0 perpendicular to
the analyzer axis is completely absorbed. The component of E0 parallel to the analyzer axis, which is allowed through by the analyzer, is E 0 cos ␪. Because the intensity of the transmitted beam varies as the square of its magnitude, we conclude that
the intensity of the (polarized) beam transmitted through the analyzer varies as
I ⫽ I max cos2 ␪

(38.14)

where I max is the intensity of the polarized beam incident on the analyzer. This expression, known as Malus’s law,2 applies to any two polarizing materials whose
transmission axes are at an angle ␪ to each other. From this expression, note that
the intensity of the transmitted beam is maximum when the transmission axes are
parallel (␪ ⫽ 0 or 180°) and that it is zero (complete absorption by the analyzer)
when the transmission axes are perpendicular to each other. This variation in
transmitted intensity through a pair of polarizing sheets is illustrated in Figure
38.29. Because the average value of cos2 ␪ is 12 , the intensity of the light passed
through an ideal polarizer is one-half the intensity of unpolarized light.

Polarization by Reﬂection
When an unpolarized light beam is reﬂected from a surface, the reﬂected light
may be completely polarized, partially polarized, or unpolarized, depending on
the angle of incidence. If the angle of incidence is 0°, the reﬂected beam is unpolarized. For other angles of incidence, the reﬂected light is polarized to some ex-

The intensity of light transmitted through two polarizers depends on the relative
orientation of their transmission axes. (a) The transmitted light has maximum intensity when the
transmission axes are aligned with each other. (b) The transmitted light has lesser intensity when
the transmission axes are at an angle of 45° with each other. (c) The transmitted light intensity is
a minimum when the transmission axes are at right angles to each other.

tent, and for one particular angle of incidence, the reﬂected light is completely
polarized. Let us now investigate reﬂection at that special angle.
Suppose that an unpolarized light beam is incident on a surface, as shown in
Figure 38.30a. Each individual electric ﬁeld vector can be resolved into two components: one parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to the page in Fig. 38.30,
represented by the dots), and the other (represented by the red arrows) perpendicular both to the ﬁrst component and to the direction of propagation. Thus, the
polarization of the entire beam can be described by two electric ﬁeld components
in these directions. It is found that the parallel component reﬂects more strongly
than the perpendicular component, and this results in a partially polarized reﬂected beam. Furthermore, the refracted beam is also partially polarized.

38.6 Polarization of Light Waves

Now suppose that the angle of incidence ␪ 1 is varied until the angle between
the reﬂected and refracted beams is 90°, as shown in Figure 38.30b. At this particular angle of incidence, the reﬂected beam is completely polarized (with its electric
ﬁeld vector parallel to the surface), and the refracted beam is still only partially
polarized. The angle of incidence at which this polarization occurs is called the
polarizing angle ␪p .
We can obtain an expression relating the polarizing angle to the index of refraction of the reﬂecting substance by using Figure 38.30b. From this ﬁgure, we

Because sin ␪ 2 ⫽ sin(90° ⫺ ␪p ) ⫽ cos ␪p , we can write this expression for n as
n ⫽ sin ␪p /cos ␪ p , which means that
n ⫽ tan ␪ p

(38.15)

This expression is called Brewster’s law, and the polarizing angle ␪p is sometimes
called Brewster’s angle, after its discoverer, David Brewster (1781 – 1868). Because n varies with wavelength for a given substance, Brewster’s angle is also a
function of wavelength.
Polarization by reﬂection is a common phenomenon. Sunlight reﬂected from
water, glass, and snow is partially polarized. If the surface is horizontal, the electric
ﬁeld vector of the reﬂected light has a strong horizontal component. Sunglasses
made of polarizing material reduce the glare of reﬂected light. The transmission
axes of the lenses are oriented vertically so that they absorb the strong horizontal
component of the reﬂected light. If you rotate sunglasses 90°, they will not be as
effective at blocking the glare from shiny horizontal surfaces.

Polarization by Double Refraction
Solids can be classiﬁed on the basis of internal structure. Those in which the atoms
are arranged in a speciﬁc order are called crystalline; the NaCl structure of Figure
38.24 is just one example of a crystalline solid. Those solids in which the atoms are
distributed randomly are called amorphous. When light travels through an amorphous material, such as glass, it travels with a speed that is the same in all directions. That is, glass has a single index of refraction. In certain crystalline materials,
however, such as calcite and quartz, the speed of light is not the same in all directions. Such materials are characterized by two indices of refraction. Hence, they
are often referred to as double-refracting or birefringent materials.
Upon entering a calcite crystal, unpolarized light splits into two planepolarized rays that travel with different velocities, corresponding to two angles of
refraction, as shown in Figure 38.31. The two rays are polarized in two mutually
perpendicular directions, as indicated by the dots and arrows. One ray, called the
ordinary (O) ray, is characterized by an index of refraction nO that is the same in
all directions. This means that if one could place a point source of light inside the
crystal, as shown in Figure 38.32, the ordinary waves would spread out from the
source as spheres.
The second plane-polarized ray, called the extraordinary (E) ray, travels with
different speeds in different directions and hence is characterized by an index of
refraction nE that varies with the direction of propagation. The point source in Fig-

ure 38.32 sends out an extraordinary wave having wave fronts that are elliptical in
cross-section. Note from Figure 38.32 that there is one direction, called the optic
axis, along which the ordinary and extraordinary rays have the same speed, corresponding to the direction for which n O ⫽ n E . The difference in speed for the two
rays is a maximum in the direction perpendicular to the optic axis. For example,
in calcite, n O ⫽ 1.658 at a wavelength of 589.3 nm, and nE varies from 1.658 along
the optic axis to 1.486 perpendicular to the optic axis. Values for nO and nE for various double-refracting crystals are given in Table 38.1.
If we place a piece of calcite on a sheet of paper and then look through the
crystal at any writing on the paper, we see two images, as shown in Figure 38.33. As
can be seen from Figure 38.31, these two images correspond to one formed by the
ordinary ray and one formed by the extraordinary ray. If the two images are viewed
through a sheet of rotating polarizing glass, they alternately appear and disappear
because the ordinary and extraordinary rays are plane-polarized along mutually
perpendicular directions.

Polarization by Scattering
When light is incident on any material, the electrons in the material can absorb
and reradiate part of the light. Such absorption and reradiation of light by electrons in the gas molecules that make up air is what causes sunlight reaching an observer on the Earth to be partially polarized. You can observe this effect — called
scattering — by looking directly up at the sky through a pair of sunglasses whose
lenses are made of polarizing material. Less light passes through at certain orientations of the lenses than at others.
Figure 38.34 illustrates how sunlight becomes polarized when it is scattered.

the ground) strikes a molecule of one of the gases that make up air, setting the
electrons of the molecule into vibration. These vibrating charges act like the vibrating charges in an antenna. The horizontal component of the electric ﬁeld vector in the incident wave results in a horizontal component of the vibration of the
charges, and the vertical component of the vector results in a vertical component
of vibration. If the observer in Figure 38.34 is looking straight up (perpendicular
to the original direction of propagation of the light), the vertical oscillations of the
charges send no radiation toward the observer. Thus, the observer sees light that is
completely polarized in the horizontal direction, as indicated by the red arrows. If
the observer looks in other directions, the light is partially polarized in the horizontal direction.
Some phenomena involving the scattering of light in the atmosphere can be
understood as follows. When light of various wavelengths ␭ is incident on gas molecules of diameter d, where d V ␭, the relative intensity of the scattered light
varies as 1/␭4. The condition d V ␭ is satisﬁed for scattering from oxygen (O2 )
and nitrogen (N 2 ) molecules in the atmosphere, whose diameters are about
0.2 nm. Hence, short wavelengths (blue light) are scattered more efﬁciently than
long wavelengths (red light). Therefore, when sunlight is scattered by gas molecules in the air, the short-wavelength radiation (blue) is scattered more intensely
than the long-wavelength radiation (red).
When you look up into the sky in a direction that is not toward the Sun, you
see the scattered light, which is predominantly blue; hence, you see a blue sky. If
you look toward the west at sunset (or toward the east at sunrise), you are looking
in a direction toward the Sun and are seeing light that has passed through a large
distance of air. Most of the blue light has been scattered by the air between you
and the Sun. The light that survives this trip through the air to you has had much
of its blue component scattered and is thus heavily weighted toward the red end of
the spectrum; as a result, you see the red and orange colors of sunset. However, a
blue sky is seen by someone to your west for whom it is still a quarter hour before
sunset.

Optical Activity
Many important applications of polarized light involve materials that display optical activity. A material is said to be optically active if it rotates the plane of polarization of any light transmitted through the material. The angle through which
the light is rotated by a speciﬁc material depends on the length of the path
through the material and on concentration if the material is in solution. One optically active material is a solution of the common sugar dextrose. A standard
method for determining the concentration of sugar solutions is to measure the rotation produced by a ﬁxed length of the solution.
Molecular asymmetry determines whether a material is optically active. For example, some proteins are optically active because of their spiral shape. Other materials, such as glass and plastic, become optically active when stressed. Suppose
that an unstressed piece of plastic is placed between a polarizer and an analyzer so
that light passes from polarizer to plastic to analyzer. When the plastic is unstressed and the analyzer axis is perpendicular to the polarizer axis, none of the
polarized light passes through the analyzer. In other words, the unstressed plastic
has no effect on the light passing through it. If the plastic is stressed, however, the
regions of greatest stress rotate the polarized light through the largest angles.
Hence, a series of bright and dark bands is observed in the transmitted light, with
the bright bands corresponding to regions of greatest stress.

Engineers often use this technique, called optical stress analysis, in designing
structures ranging from bridges to small tools. They build a plastic model and analyze it under different load conditions to determine regions of potential weakness
and failure under stress. Some examples of a plastic model under stress are shown
in Figure 38.35.
The liquid crystal displays found in most calculators have their optical activity
changed by the application of electric potential across different parts of the display. Try using a pair of polarizing sunglasses to investigate the polarization used in

SUMMARY
Diffraction is the deviation of light from a straight-line path when the light passes
through an aperture or around an obstacle.
The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a single slit of width a on a
distant screen consists of a central bright fringe and alternating bright and dark
fringes of much lower intensities. The angles ␪ at which the diffraction pattern has
zero intensity, corresponding to destructive interference, are given by

where ␤ ⫽ (2␲ a sin ␪ )/␭ and I max is the intensity at ␪ ⫽ 0.
Rayleigh’s criterion, which is a limiting condition of resolution, states that
two images formed by an aperture are just distinguishable if the central maximum
of the diffraction pattern for one image falls on the ﬁrst minimum of the diffrac-

width a is ␪ min ⫽ ␭/a, and the limiting angle of resolution for a circular aperture
of diameter D is ␪ min ⫽ 1.22 ␭/D.
A diffraction grating consists of a large number of equally spaced, identical
slits. The condition for intensity maxima in the interference pattern of a diffraction grating for normal incidence is

m ⫽ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .

the diffraction pattern is
R ⫽ Nm

(38.12)

where N is the number of lines in the grating that are illuminated.
When polarized light of intensity I 0 is emitted by a polarizer and then incident
on an analyzer, the light transmitted through the analyzer has an intensity equal to
I max cos2 ␪, where ␪ is the angle between the polarizer and analyzer transmission
axes.
In general, reﬂected light is partially polarized. However, reﬂected light is
completely polarized when the angle of incidence is such that the angle between
the reﬂected and refracted beams is 90°. This angle of incidence, called the polarizing angle ␪p , satisﬁes Brewster’s law:
n ⫽ tan ␪ p

where n is the index of refraction of the reﬂecting medium.

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
38.1 The space between the slightly open door and the doorframe acts as a single slit. Sound waves have wavelengths
that are approximately the same size as the opening and
so are diffracted and spread throughout the room you
are in. Because light wavelengths are much smaller than
the slit width, they are virtually undiffracted. As a result,
you must have a direct line of sight to detect the light
waves.
38.2 The situation is like that depicted in Figure 38.11 except
that now the slits are only half as far apart. The diffraction pattern is the same, but the interference pattern is
stretched out because d is smaller. Because d /a ⫽ 3, the
third interference maximum coincides with the ﬁrst diffraction minimum. Your sketch should look like the ﬁgure to the right.
38.3 Yes, but no diffraction effects are observed because the
separation distance between adjacent ribs is so much
greater than the wavelength of the x-rays.

ost of our everyday experiences and observations have to do with objects
that move at speeds much less than the speed of light. Newtonian mechanics was formulated to describe the motion of such objects, and this formalism is still very successful in describing a wide range of phenomena that occur at
low speeds. It fails, however, when applied to particles whose speeds approach that
of light.
Experimentally, the predictions of Newtonian theory can be tested at high
speeds by accelerating electrons or other charged particles through a large electric
potential difference. For example, it is possible to accelerate an electron to a
speed of 0.99c (where c is the speed of light) by using a potential difference of several million volts. According to Newtonian mechanics, if the potential difference is
increased by a factor of 4, the electron’s kinetic energy is four times greater and its
speed should double to 1.98c. However, experiments show that the speed of the
electron — as well as the speed of any other particle in the Universe — always remains less than the speed of light, regardless of the size of the accelerating voltage.
Because it places no upper limit on speed, Newtonian mechanics is contrary to
modern experimental results and is clearly a limited theory.
In 1905, at the age of only 26, Einstein published his special theory of relativity. Regarding the theory, Einstein wrote:
The relativity theory arose from necessity, from serious and deep contradictions in the old theory from which there seemed no escape. The strength of
the new theory lies in the consistency and simplicity with which it solves all
these difﬁculties . . . . 1

Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the
special theory of relativity alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. With this theory, experimental observations can be correctly predicted over the range of speeds from v ⫽ 0 to speeds approaching the speed of
light. At low speeds, Einstein’s theory reduces to Newtonian mechanics as a limiting situation. It is important to recognize that Einstein was working on electromagnetism when he developed the special theory of relativity. He was convinced that
Maxwell’s equations were correct, and in order to reconcile them with one of his
postulates, he was forced into the bizarre notion of assuming that space and time
are not absolute.
This chapter gives an introduction to the special theory of relativity, with emphasis on some of its consequences. The special theory covers phenomena such as
the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference
frames as measured by a stationary observer. We also discuss the relativistic forms
of momentum and energy, as well as some consequences of the famous mass –
energy formula, E ⫽ mc 2.
In addition to its well-known and essential role in theoretical physics, the special theory of relativity has practical applications, including the design of nuclear
power plants and modern global positioning system (GPS) units. These devices do
not work if designed in accordance with nonrelativistic principles.
We shall have occasion to use relativity in some subsequent chapters of the extended version of this text, most often presenting only the outcome of relativistic
effects.

Inertial frame of reference

Relativity

THE PRINCIPLE OF GALILEAN RELATIVITY

To describe a physical event, it is necessary to establish a frame of reference. You
should recall from Chapter 5 that Newton’s laws are valid in all inertial frames of
reference. Because an inertial frame is deﬁned as one in which Newton’s ﬁrst law
is valid, we can say that an inertial frame of reference is one in which an object
is observed to have no acceleration when no forces act on it. Furthermore,
any system moving with constant velocity with respect to an inertial system must
also be an inertial system.
There is no preferred inertial reference frame. This means that the results of
an experiment performed in a vehicle moving with uniform velocity will be identical to the results of the same experiment performed in a stationary vehicle. The
formal statement of this result is called the principle of Galilean relativity:
The laws of mechanics must be the same in all inertial frames of reference.
Let us consider an observation that illustrates the equivalence of the laws of
mechanics in different inertial frames. A pickup truck moves with a constant velocity, as shown in Figure 39.1a. If a passenger in the truck throws a ball straight up,
and if air effects are neglected, the passenger observes that the ball moves in a vertical path. The motion of the ball appears to be precisely the same as if the ball
were thrown by a person at rest on the Earth. The law of gravity and the equations
of motion under constant acceleration are obeyed whether the truck is at rest or in
uniform motion.
Now consider the same situation viewed by an observer at rest on the Earth.
This stationary observer sees the path of the ball as a parabola, as illustrated in Figure 39.1b. Furthermore, according to this observer, the ball has a horizontal component of velocity equal to the velocity of the truck. Although the two observers
disagree on certain aspects of the situation, they agree on the validity of Newton’s
laws and on such classical principles as conservation of energy and conservation of
linear momentum. This agreement implies that no mechanical experiment can
detect any difference between the two inertial frames. The only thing that can be
detected is the relative motion of one frame with respect to the other. That is, the
notion of absolute motion through space is meaningless, as is the notion of a preferred reference frame.

Which observer in Figure 39.1 is right about the ball’s path?

Suppose that some physical phenomenon, which we call an event, occurs in an
inertial system. The event’s location and time of occurrence can be speciﬁed by the
four coordinates (x, y, z, t). We would like to be able to transform these coordinates
from one inertial system to another one moving with uniform relative velocity.
Consider two inertial systems S and S⬘ (Fig. 39.2). The system S⬘ moves with a
constant velocity v along the xx⬘ axes, where v is measured relative to S. We assume
that an event occurs at the point P and that the origins of S and S⬘ coincide at
t ⫽ 0. An observer in S describes the event with space – time coordinates (x, y, z, t),
whereas an observer in S⬘ uses the coordinates (x⬘, y⬘, z⬘, t⬘) to describe the same
event. As we see from Figure 39.2, the relationships between these various coordinates can be written

relative to S.

Galilean space – time
transformation equations

z⬘ ⫽ z
t⬘ ⫽ t
These equations are the Galilean space – time transformation equations. Note
that time is assumed to be the same in both inertial systems. That is, within the
framework of classical mechanics, all clocks run at the same rate, regardless of
their velocity, so that the time at which an event occurs for an observer in S is the
same as the time for the same event in S⬘. Consequently, the time interval between
two successive events should be the same for both observers. Although this assumption may seem obvious, it turns out to be incorrect in situations where v is
comparable to the speed of light.
Now suppose that a particle moves a distance dx in a time interval dt as measured by an observer in S. It follows from Equations 39.1 that the corresponding
distance dx ⬘ measured by an observer in S⬘ is dx⬘ ⫽ dx ⫺ v dt, where frame S⬘ is
moving with speed v relative to frame S. Because dt ⫽ dt⬘, we ﬁnd that

where u x and u⬘x are the x components of the velocity relative to S and S⬘, respectively. (We use the symbol u for particle velocity rather than v, which is used for
the relative velocity of two reference frames.) This is the Galilean velocity transformation equation. It is used in everyday observations and is consistent with our
intuitive notion of time and space. As we shall soon see, however, it leads to serious
contradictions when applied to electromagnetic waves.

through a medium called the ether and that the speed of light was c only in a special, absolute frame at rest with respect to the ether. The Galilean velocity transformation equation was expected to hold in any frame moving at speed v relative to
the absolute ether frame.
Because the existence of a preferred, absolute ether frame would show that
light was similar to other classical waves and that Newtonian ideas of an absolute
frame were true, considerable importance was attached to establishing the existence of the ether frame. Prior to the late 1800s, experiments involving light traveling in media moving at the highest laboratory speeds attainable at that time were
not capable of detecting changes as small as c ⫾ v. Starting in about 1880, scientists decided to use the Earth as the moving frame in an attempt to improve their
chances of detecting these small changes in the speed of light.
As observers ﬁxed on the Earth, we can say that we are stationary and that the
absolute ether frame containing the medium for light propagation moves past us
with speed v. Determining the speed of light under these circumstances is just like
determining the speed of an aircraft traveling in a moving air current, or wind;
consequently, we speak of an “ether wind” blowing through our apparatus ﬁxed to
the Earth.
A direct method for detecting an ether wind would use an apparatus ﬁxed to
the Earth to measure the wind’s inﬂuence on the speed of light. If v is the speed of
the ether relative to the Earth, then the speed of light should have its maximum
value, c ⫹ v, when propagating downwind, as shown in Figure 39.3a. Likewise, the
speed of light should have its minimum value, c ⫺ v, when propagating upwind, as
shown in Figure 39.3b, and an intermediate value, (c 2 ⫺ v 2 )1/2, in the direction
perpendicular to the ether wind, as shown in Figure 39.3c. If the Sun is assumed to
be at rest in the ether, then the velocity of the ether wind would be equal to the orbital velocity of the Earth around the Sun, which has a magnitude of approximately 3 ⫻ 104 m/s. Because c ⫽ 3 ⫻ 10 8 m/s, it should be possible to detect a
change in speed of about 1 part in 104 for measurements in the upwind or downwind directions. However, as we shall see in the next section, all attempts to detect
such changes and establish the existence of the ether wind (and hence the absolute
frame) proved futile! (You may want to return to Problem 40 in Chapter 4 to see a
situation in which the Galilean velocity transformation equation does hold.)
If it is assumed that the laws of electricity and magnetism are the same in all
inertial frames, a paradox concerning the speed of light immediately arises. We
can understand this by recognizing that Maxwell’s equations seem to imply that
the speed of light always has the ﬁxed value 3.00 ⫻ 108 m/s in all inertial frames, a
result in direct contradiction to what is expected based on the Galilean velocity
transformation equation. According to Galilean relativity, the speed of light should
not be the same in all inertial frames.
For example, suppose a light pulse is sent out by an observer S⬘ standing in a
boxcar moving with a velocity v relative to a stationary observer standing alongside
the track (Fig. 39.4). The light pulse has a speed c relative to S⬘. According to
Galilean relativity, the pulse speed relative to S should be c ⫹ v. This is in contradiction to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which, as we shall see, postulates
that the speed of the pulse is the same for all observers.

To resolve this contradiction in theories, we must conclude that either (1)
the laws of electricity and magnetism are not the same in all inertial frames or
(2) the Galilean velocity transformation equation is incorrect. If we assume the
first alternative, then a preferred reference frame in which the speed of light has
the value c must exist and the measured speed must be greater or less than this
value in any other reference frame, in accordance with the Galilean velocity
transformation equation. If we assume the second alternative, then we are forced
to abandon the notions of absolute time and absolute length that form the basis
of the Galilean space – time transformation equations.

39.2

THE MICHELSON – MORLEY EXPERIMENT

The most famous experiment designed to detect small changes in the speed of
light was ﬁrst performed in 1881 by Albert A. Michelson (see Section 37.7) and
later repeated under various conditions by Michelson and Edward W. Morley
(1838 – 1923). We state at the outset that the outcome of the experiment contradicted the ether hypothesis.
The experiment was designed to determine the velocity of the Earth relative to
that of the hypothetical ether. The experimental tool used was the Michelson interferometer, which was discussed in Section 37.7 and is shown again in Figure
39.5. Arm 2 is aligned along the direction of the Earth’s motion through space.
The Earth moving through the ether at speed v is equivalent to the ether ﬂowing
past the Earth in the opposite direction with speed v. This ether wind blowing in
the direction opposite the direction of Earth’s motion should cause the speed of
light measured in the Earth frame to be c ⫺ v as the light approaches mirror M 2
and c ⫹ v after reﬂection, where c is the speed of light in the ether frame.
The two beams reﬂected from M 1 and M 2 recombine, and an interference
pattern consisting of alternating dark and bright fringes is formed. The interference pattern was observed while the interferometer was rotated through an angle
of 90°. This rotation supposedly would change the speed of the ether wind along
the arms of the interferometer. The rotation should have caused the fringe pattern to shift slightly but measurably, but measurements failed to show any change
in the interference pattern! The Michelson – Morley experiment was repeated at
different times of the year when the ether wind was expected to change direction

and magnitude, but the results were always the same: no fringe shift of the magnitude required was ever observed.2
The negative results of the Michelson – Morley experiment not only contradicted the ether hypothesis but also showed that it was impossible to measure the
absolute velocity of the Earth with respect to the ether frame. However, as we shall
see in the next section, Einstein offered a postulate for his special theory of relativity that places quite a different interpretation on these null results. In later years,
when more was known about the nature of light, the idea of an ether that permeates all of space was relegated to the ash heap of worn-out concepts. Light is now
understood to be an electromagnetic wave, which requires no medium for
its propagation. As a result, the idea of an ether in which these waves could travel
became unnecessary.

Details of the Michelson – Morley Experiment
To understand the outcome of the Michelson – Morley experiment, let us assume
that the two arms of the interferometer in Figure 39.5 are of equal length L. We
shall analyze the situation as if there were an ether wind, because that is what
Michelson and Morley expected to ﬁnd. As noted above, the speed of the light beam
along arm 2 should be c ⫺ v as the beam approaches M 2 and c ⫹ v after the beam is
reﬂected. Thus, the time of travel to the right is L /(c ⫺ v), and the time of travel to
the left is L/(c ⫹ v). The total time needed for the round trip along arm 2 is

Albert Einstein

(1879 – 1955)
Einstein, one of the greatest physicists of all times, was born in Ulm,
Germany. In 1905, at the age of 26, he
published four scientiﬁc papers that
revolutionized physics. Two of these
papers were concerned with what is
now considered his most important
contribution: the special theory of relativity.
In 1916, Einstein published his
work on the general theory of relativity. The most dramatic prediction of
this theory is the degree to which
light is deﬂected by a gravitational
ﬁeld. Measurements made by astronomers on bright stars in the vicinity of the eclipsed Sun in 1919 conﬁrmed Einstein’s prediction, and as a
result Einstein became a world
celebrity.
Einstein was deeply disturbed by
the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s despite his own role
as a scientiﬁc revolutionary. In particular, he could never accept the probabilistic view of events in nature that
is a central feature of quantum theory.
The last few decades of his life were
devoted to an unsuccessful search
for a uniﬁed theory that would combine gravitation and electromagnetism. (AIP Niels Bohr Library)

Now consider the light beam traveling along arm 1, perpendicular to the
ether wind. Because the speed of the beam relative to the Earth is (c 2 ⫺ v 2 )1/2 in
this case (see Fig. 39.3), the time of travel for each half of the trip is
L /(c 2 ⫺ v 2 )1/2, and the total time of travel for the round trip is

This time difference between the two instants at which the reﬂected beams arrive at the viewing telescope gives rise to a phase difference between the beams,
2 From an Earth observer’s point of view, changes in the Earth’s speed and direction of motion in the
course of a year are viewed as ether wind shifts. Even if the speed of the Earth with respect to the ether
were zero at some time, six months later the speed of the Earth would be 60 km/s with respect to the
ether, and as a result a fringe shift should be noticed. No shift has ever been observed, however.

producing an interference pattern when they combine at the position of the telescope. A shift in the interference pattern should be detected when the interferometer is rotated through 90° in a horizontal plane, so that the two beams exchange
roles. This results in a time difference twice that given by Equation 39.3. Thus, the
path difference that corresponds to this time difference is

In the experiments by Michelson and Morley, each light beam was reﬂected by

The instrument used by Michelson and Morley could detect shifts as small as 0.01
fringe. However, it detected no shift whatsoever in the fringe pattern. Since
then, the experiment has been repeated many times by different scientists under a
wide variety of conditions, and no fringe shift has ever been detected. Thus, it was
concluded that the motion of the Earth with respect to the postulated ether cannot be detected.
Many efforts were made to explain the null results of the Michelson – Morley
experiment and to save the ether frame concept and the Galilean velocity transformation equation for light. All proposals resulting from these efforts have been
shown to be wrong. No experiment in the history of physics received such valiant
efforts to explain the absence of an expected result as did the Michelson – Morley
experiment. The stage was set for Einstein, who solved the problem in 1905 with
his special theory of relativity.

EINSTEIN’S PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY

In the previous section we noted the impossibility of measuring the speed of the
ether with respect to the Earth and the failure of the Galilean velocity transformation equation in the case of light. Einstein proposed a theory that boldly removed
these difﬁculties and at the same time completely altered our notion of space and
time.3 He based his special theory of relativity on two postulates:

The postulates of the special
theory of relativity

CHAPTER 39

Relativity

1. The principle of relativity: The laws of physics must be the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The constancy of the speed of light: The speed of light in vacuum has the
same value, c ⫽ 3.00 ⫻ 10 8 m/s, in all inertial frames, regardless of the velocity of the observer or the velocity of the source emitting the light.
The ﬁrst postulate asserts that all the laws of physics — those dealing with mechanics, electricity and magnetism, optics, thermodynamics, and so on — are the
same in all reference frames moving with constant velocity relative to one another.
This postulate is a sweeping generalization of the principle of Galilean relativity,
which refers only to the laws of mechanics. From an experimental point of view,
Einstein’s principle of relativity means that any kind of experiment (measuring the
speed of light, for example) performed in a laboratory at rest must give the same
result when performed in a laboratory moving at a constant velocity past the ﬁrst
one. Hence, no preferred inertial reference frame exists, and it is impossible to detect absolute motion.
Note that postulate 2 is required by postulate 1: If the speed of light were not
the same in all inertial frames, measurements of different speeds would make it
possible to distinguish between inertial frames; as a result, a preferred, absolute
frame could be identiﬁed, in contradiction to postulate 1.
Although the Michelson – Morley experiment was performed before Einstein
published his work on relativity, it is not clear whether or not Einstein was aware of
the details of the experiment. Nonetheless, the null result of the experiment can
be readily understood within the framework of Einstein’s theory. According to his
principle of relativity, the premises of the Michelson – Morley experiment were incorrect. In the process of trying to explain the expected results, we stated that
when light traveled against the ether wind its speed was c ⫺v, in accordance with
the Galilean velocity transformation equation. However, if the state of motion of
the observer or of the source has no inﬂuence on the value found for the speed
of light, one always measures the value to be c. Likewise, the light makes the
return trip after reﬂection from the mirror at speed c, not at speed c ⫹ v. Thus,
the motion of the Earth does not inﬂuence the fringe pattern observed in the
Michelson – Morley experiment, and a null result should be expected.
If we accept Einstein’s theory of relativity, we must conclude that relative motion is unimportant when measuring the speed of light. At the same time, we shall
see that we must alter our common-sense notion of space and time and be prepared for some bizarre consequences. It may help as you read the pages ahead to
keep in mind that our common-sense ideas are based on a lifetime of everyday experiences and not on observations of objects moving at hundreds of thousands of
kilometers per second.

CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPECIAL THEORY
OF RELATIVITY

Before we discuss the consequences of Einstein’s special theory of relativity, we
must ﬁrst understand how an observer located in an inertial reference frame describes an event. As mentioned earlier, an event is an occurrence describable by
three space coordinates and one time coordinate. Different observers in different
inertial frames usually describe the same event with different coordinates.

39.4 Consequences of the Special Theory of Relativity

Figure 39.6 In studying relativity,
we use a reference frame consisting
of a coordinate grid and a set of synchronized clocks.
The reference frame used to describe an event consists of a coordinate grid
and a set of synchronized clocks located at the grid intersections, as shown in Figure 39.6 in two dimensions. The clocks can be synchronized in many ways with the
help of light signals. For example, suppose an observer is located at the origin with
a master clock and sends out a pulse of light at t ⫽ 0. The pulse takes a time r/c to
reach a clock located a distance r from the origin. Hence, this clock is synchronized with the master clock if this clock reads r/c at the instant the pulse reaches
it. This procedure of synchronization assumes that the speed of light has the same
value in all directions and in all inertial frames. Furthermore, the procedure concerns an event recorded by an observer in a speciﬁc inertial reference frame. An
observer in some other inertial frame would assign different space – time coordinates to events being observed by using another coordinate grid and another array
of clocks.
As we examine some of the consequences of relativity in the remainder of this
section, we restrict our discussion to the concepts of simultaneity, time, and
length, all three of which are quite different in relativistic mechanics from what
they are in Newtonian mechanics. For example, in relativistic mechanics the distance between two points and the time interval between two events depend on the
frame of reference in which they are measured. That is, in relativistic mechanics
there is no such thing as absolute length or absolute time. Furthermore,
events at different locations that are observed to occur simultaneously in
one frame are not observed to be simultaneous in another frame moving
uniformly past the ﬁrst.

Simultaneity and the Relativity of Time
A basic premise of Newtonian mechanics is that a universal time scale exists that is
the same for all observers. In fact, Newton wrote that “Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, ﬂows equably without relation to
anything external.” Thus, Newton and his followers simply took simultaneity for
granted. In his special theory of relativity, Einstein abandoned this assumption.
Einstein devised the following thought experiment to illustrate this point. A
boxcar moves with uniform velocity, and two lightning bolts strike its ends, as illustrated in Figure 39.7a, leaving marks on the boxcar and on the ground. The marks
on the boxcar are labeled A⬘ and B⬘, and those on the ground are labeled A and
B. An observer O⬘ moving with the boxcar is midway between A⬘ and B⬘, and a
ground observer O is midway between A and B. The events recorded by the observers are the striking of the boxcar by the two lightning bolts.

do not appear to be simultaneous to observer O⬘, who claims that the front of the car is struck before the rear. Note that in (b) the leftward-traveling light signal has already passed O ⬘ but the
rightward-traveling signal has not yet reached O ⬘.
The light signals recording the instant at which the two bolts strike reach observer O at the same time, as indicated in Figure 39.7b. This observer realizes that
the signals have traveled at the same speed over equal distances, and so rightly
concludes that the events at A and B occurred simultaneously. Now consider the
same events as viewed by observer O⬘. By the time the signals have reached observer O, observer O⬘ has moved as indicated in Figure 39.7b. Thus, the signal
from B⬘ has already swept past O⬘, but the signal from A⬘ has not yet reached O⬘.
In other words, O⬘ sees the signal from B⬘ before seeing the signal from A⬘. According to Einstein, the two observers must ﬁnd that light travels at the same speed.
Therefore, observer O⬘ concludes that the lightning strikes the front of the boxcar
before it strikes the back.
This thought experiment clearly demonstrates that the two events that appear
to be simultaneous to observer O do not appear to be simultaneous to observer O⬘.
In other words,
two events that are simultaneous in one reference frame are in general not simultaneous in a second frame moving relative to the ﬁrst. That is, simultaneity
is not an absolute concept but rather one that depends on the state of motion
of the observer.

Quick Quiz 39.3
Which observer in Figure 39.7 is correct?

The central point of relativity is this: Any inertial frame of reference can be
used to describe events and do physics. There is no preferred inertial frame of
reference. However, observers in different inertial frames always measure different time intervals with their clocks and different distances with their meter sticks.
Nevertheless, all observers agree on the forms of the laws of physics in their respective frames because these laws must be the same for all observers in uniform
motion. For example, the relationship F ⫽ ma in a frame S has the same form
F ⬘ ⫽ ma⬘ in a frame S⬘ that is moving at constant velocity relative to frame S. It is

1257

39.4 Consequences of the Special Theory of Relativity

the alteration of time and space that allows the laws of physics (including
Maxwell’s equations) to be the same for all observers in uniform motion.

Time Dilation
We can illustrate the fact that observers in different inertial frames always measure
different time intervals between a pair of events by considering a vehicle moving to
the right with a speed v, as shown in Figure 39.8a. A mirror is ﬁxed to the ceiling
of the vehicle, and observer O⬘ at rest in this system holds a laser a distance d below the mirror. At some instant, the laser emits a pulse of light directed toward the
mirror (event 1), and at some later time after reﬂecting from the mirror, the pulse
arrives back at the laser (event 2). Observer O⬘ carries a clock C ⬘ and uses it to
measure the time interval ⌬t p between these two events. (The subscript p stands
for proper, as we shall see in a moment.) Because the light pulse has a speed c, the
time it takes the pulse to travel from O⬘ to the mirror and back to O⬘ is
⌬t p ⫽

Distance traveled

(39.5)

This time interval ⌬t p measured by O⬘ requires only a single clock C ⬘ located at
the same place as the laser in this frame.
Now consider the same pair of events as viewed by observer O in a second
frame, as shown in Figure 39.8b. According to this observer, the mirror and laser
are moving to the right with a speed v, and as a result the sequence of events appears entirely different. By the time the light from the laser reaches the mirror, the
mirror has moved to the right a distance v ⌬t/2, where ⌬t is the time it takes the
light to travel from O⬘ to the mirror and back to O⬘ as measured by O. In other
words, O concludes that, because of the motion of the vehicle, if the light is to hit
the mirror, it must leave the laser at an angle with respect to the vertical direction.
Comparing Figure 39.8a and b, we see that the light must travel farther in (b)
than in (a). (Note that neither observer “knows” that he or she is moving. Each is
at rest in his or her own inertial frame.)

CHAPTER 39

Relativity

According to the second postulate of the special theory of relativity, both observers must measure c for the speed of light. Because the light travels farther in
the frame of O, it follows that the time interval ⌬t measured by O is longer than
the time interval ⌬t p measured by O⬘. To obtain a relationship between these two
time intervals, it is convenient to use the right triangle shown in Figure 39.8c. The
Pythagorean theorem gives

Because ␥ is always greater than unity, this result says that the time interval ⌬t
measured by an observer moving with respect to a clock is longer than the
time interval ⌬t p measured by an observer at rest with respect to the clock.
(That is, ⌬t ⬎ ⌬t p .) This effect is known as time dilation. Figure 39.9 shows that
as the velocity approaches the speed of light, ␥ increases dramatically. Note that for speeds less than one tenth the speed of light, ␥ is very
nearly equal to unity.
The time interval ⌬t p in Equations 39.5 and 39.7 is called the proper time.
(In German, Einstein used the term Eigenzeit, which means “own-time.”) In general, proper time is the time interval between two events measured by an observer who sees the events occur at the same point in space. Proper time is always the time measured with a single clock (clock C ⬘ in our case) at rest in the
frame in which the events take place.
If a clock is moving with respect to you, it appears to fall behind (tick more slowly
than) the clocks it is passing in the grid of synchronized clocks in your reference
frame. Because the time interval ␥(2d/c), the interval between ticks of a moving

than a clock in your reference frame by a factor ␥. This is true for mechanical clocks
as well as for the light clock just described. We can generalize this result by stating
that all physical processes, including chemical and biological ones, slow down relative
to a stationary clock when those processes occur in a moving frame. For example, the
heartbeat of an astronaut moving through space would keep time with a clock inside
the spaceship. Both the astronaut’s clock and heartbeat would be slowed down relative to a stationary clock back on the Earth (although the astronaut would have no
sensation of life slowing down in the spaceship).

A rocket has a clock built into its control panel. Use Figure 39.9 to determine approximately how fast the rocket must be moving before its clock appears to an Earth-bound observer to be ticking at one ﬁfth the rate of a clock on the wall at Mission Control. What does
an astronaut in the rocket observe?

Bizarre as it may seem, time dilation is a veriﬁable phenomenon. An experiment reported by Hafele and Keating provided direct evidence of time dilation.4
Time intervals measured with four cesium atomic clocks in jet ﬂight were compared with time intervals measured by Earth-based reference atomic clocks. In order to compare these results with theory, many factors had to be considered, including periods of acceleration and deceleration relative to the Earth, variations in
direction of travel, and the fact that the gravitational ﬁeld experienced by the ﬂying clocks was weaker than that experienced by the Earth-based clock. The results
were in good agreement with the predictions of the special theory of relativity and
can be explained in terms of the relative motion between the Earth and the jet aircraft. In their paper, Hafele and Keating stated that “Relative to the atomic time
scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the ﬂying clocks lost 59 ⫾ 10 ns during the
eastward trip and gained 273 ⫾ 7 ns during the westward trip . . . . These results provide an unambiguous empirical resolution of the famous clock paradox
with macroscopic clocks.”
Another interesting example of time dilation involves the observation of muons,
unstable elementary particles that have a charge equal to that of the electron and a
mass 207 times that of the electron. Muons can be produced by the collision of cosmic radiation with atoms high in the atmosphere. These particles have a lifetime of
2.2 ␮s when measured in a reference frame in which they are at rest or moving
slowly. If we take 2.2 ␮s as the average lifetime of a muon and assume that its speed
is close to the speed of light, we ﬁnd that these particles travel only approximately
600 m before they decay (Fig. 39.10a). Hence, they cannot reach the Earth from
the upper atmosphere where they are produced. However, experiments show that a
large number of muons do reach the Earth. The phenomenon of time dilation explains this effect. Relative to an observer on the Earth, the muons have a lifetime
equal to ␥␶p , where ␶p ⫽ 2.2 ␮s is the lifetime in the frame traveling with the
muons or the proper lifetime. For example, for a muon speed of v ⫽ 0.99c, ␥ ⬇ 7.1
and ␥␶p ⬇ 16 ␮s. Hence, the average distance traveled as measured by an observer
on the Earth is ␥ v ␶p ⬇ 4 800 m, as indicated in Figure 39.10b.

counters around the ring, enabling scientists to measure the decay rate and hence
the muon lifetime. The lifetime of the moving muons was measured to be approximately 30 times as long as that of the stationary muon (Fig. 39.11), in agreement

What Is the Period of the Pendulum?

The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the reference frame of the pendulum. What is the period when
measured by an observer moving at a speed of 0.95c relative
to the pendulum?

Solution

Instead of the observer moving at 0.95c, we can
take the equivalent point of view that the observer is at rest
and the pendulum is moving at 0.95c past the stationary observer. Hence, the pendulum is an example of a moving
clock.
The proper time is ⌬t p ⫽ 3.0 s. Because a moving clock

How Long Was Your Trip?

Suppose you are driving your car on a business trip and are
traveling at 30 m/s. Your boss, who is waiting at your destination, expects the trip to take 5.0 h. When you arrive late, your
excuse is that your car clock registered the passage of 5.0 h
but that you were driving fast and so your clock ran more
slowly than your boss’s clock. If your car clock actually did indicate a 5.0-h trip, how much time passed on your boss’s
clock, which was at rest on the Earth?

The Twins Paradox
An intriguing consequence of time dilation is the so-called twins paradox (Fig.
39.12). Consider an experiment involving a set of twins named Speedo and Goslo.
When they are 20 yr old, Speedo, the more adventuresome of the two, sets out on
an epic journey to Planet X, located 20 ly from the Earth. Furthermore, his spaceship is capable of reaching a speed of 0.95c relative to the inertial frame of his twin
brother back home. After reaching Planet X, Speedo becomes homesick and immediately returns to the Earth at the same speed 0.95c. Upon his return, Speedo is
shocked to discover that Goslo has aged 42 yr and is now 62 yr old. Speedo, on the
other hand, has aged only 13 yr.
At this point, it is fair to raise the following question — which twin is the traveler and which is really younger as a result of this experiment? From Goslo’s frame
of reference, he was at rest while his brother traveled at a high speed. But from
Speedo’s perspective, it is he who was at rest while Goslo was on the high-speed
space journey. According to Speedo, he himself remained stationary while Goslo
and the Earth raced away from him on a 6.5-yr journey and then headed back for
another 6.5 yr. This leads to an apparent contradiction. Which twin has developed
signs of excess aging?
To resolve this apparent paradox, recall that the special theory of relativity
deals with inertial frames of reference moving relative to each other at uniform
speed. However, the trip in our current problem is not symmetrical. Speedo, the
space traveler, must experience a series of accelerations during his journey. As a result, his speed is not always uniform, and consequently he is not in an inertial
frame. He cannot be regarded as always being at rest while Goslo is in uniform motion because to do so would be an incorrect application of the special theory of
relativity. Therefore, there is no paradox. During each passing year noted by
Goslo, slightly less than 4 months elapsed for Speedo.
The conclusion that Speedo is in a noninertial frame is inescapable. Each twin
observes the other as accelerating, but it is Speedo that actually undergoes dynamical acceleration due to the real forces acting on him. The time required to accelerate and decelerate Speedo’s spaceship may be made very small by using large rockets, so that Speedo can claim that he spends most of his time traveling to Planet X

at 0.95c in an inertial frame. However, Speedo must slow down, reverse his motion,
and return to the Earth in an altogether different inertial frame. At the very best,
Speedo is in two different inertial frames during his journey. Only Goslo, who is
in a single inertial frame, can apply the simple time-dilation formula to Speedo’s
trip. Thus, Goslo ﬁnds that instead of aging 42 yr, Speedo ages only
(1 ⫺ v 2/c 2 )1/2(42 yr) ⫽ 13 yr. Conversely, Speedo spends 6.5 yr traveling to
Planet X and 6.5 yr returning, for a total travel time of 13 yr, in agreement with
our earlier statement.

in which the stick has a velocity v
relative to the frame is shorter
than its proper length Lp by a
factor (1 ⫺ v 2/c 2 )1/2.

Length Contraction
The measured distance between two points also depends on the frame of reference. The proper length Lp of an object is the length measured by someone
at rest relative to the object. The length of an object measured by someone in a
reference frame that is moving with respect to the object is always less than the
proper length. This effect is known as length contraction.
Consider a spaceship traveling with a speed v from one star to another. There
are two observers: one on the Earth and the other in the spaceship. The observer
at rest on the Earth (and also assumed to be at rest with respect to the two stars)
measures the distance between the stars to be the proper length Lp . According to
this observer, the time it takes the spaceship to complete the voyage is ⌬t ⫽ L p /v.
Because of time dilation, the space traveler measures a smaller time of travel by
the spaceship clock: ⌬t p ⫽ ⌬t/␥. The space traveler claims to be at rest and sees
the destination star moving toward the spaceship with speed v. Because the space
traveler reaches the star in the time ⌬t p , he or she concludes that the distance L between the stars is shorter than L p . This distance measured by the space traveler is

where (1 ⫺ v 2/c 2 )1/2 is a factor less than unity. This result may be interpreted as
follows:
For example, suppose that a stick moves past a stationary Earth observer with
speed v, as shown in Figure 39.13. The length of the stick as measured by an observer in a frame attached to the stick is the proper length L p shown in Figure
39.13a. The length of the stick L measured by the Earth observer is shorter than
L p by the factor (1 ⫺ v 2/c 2 )1/2. Furthermore, length contraction is a symmetrical
effect: If the stick is at rest on the Earth, an observer in a moving frame would

1263

39.4 Consequences of the Special Theory of Relativity

measure its length to be shorter by the same factor (1 ⫺ v 2/c 2 )1/2. Note that
length contraction takes place only along the direction of motion.
It is important to emphasize that proper length and proper time are measured
in different reference frames. As an example of this point, let us return to the decaying muons moving at speeds close to the speed of light. An observer in the
muon reference frame measures the proper lifetime (that is, the time interval ␶p ),
whereas an Earth-based observer measures a dilated lifetime. However, the Earthbased observer measures the proper height (the length L p ) of the mountain in
Figure 39.10b. In the muon reference frame, this height is less than L p , as the ﬁgure shows. Thus, in the muon frame, length contraction occurs but time dilation
does not. In the Earth-based reference frame, time dilation occurs but length contraction does not. Thus, when calculations on the muon are performed in both

A Voyage to Sirius

An astronaut takes a trip to Sirius, which is located a distance
of 8 lightyears from the Earth. (Note that 1 lightyear (ly) is
the distance light travels through free space in 1 yr.) The astronaut measures the time of the one-way journey to be 6 yr.

Space – Time Graphs
It is sometimes helpful to make a space – time graph, in which time is the ordinate
and displacement is the abscissa. The twins paradox is displayed in such a graph in
Figure 39.14. A path through space – time is called a world-line. At the origin, the
world-lines of Speedo and Goslo coincide because the twins are in the same location at the same time. After Speedo leaves on his trip, his world-line diverges from
that of his brother. At their reunion, the two world-lines again come together.
Note that Goslo’s world-line is vertical, indicating no displacement from his original location. Also note that it would be impossible for Speedo to have a world-line
that crossed the path of a light beam that left the Earth when he did. To do so
would require him to have a speed greater than c.
World-lines for light beams are diagonal lines on space – time graphs, typically
drawn at 45° to the right or left of vertical, depending on whether the light beam
is traveling in the direction of increasing or decreasing x. These two world-lines
means that all possible future events for Goslo and Speedo lie within two 45° lines
extending from the origin. Either twin’s presence at an event outside this “light
cone” would require that twin to move at a speed greater than c, which, as we shall
see in Section 39.5, is not possible. Also, the only past events that Goslo and
Speedo could have experienced occurred within two similar 45° world-lines that
approach the origin from below the x axis.

The Relativistic Doppler Effect
Another important consequence of time dilation is the shift in frequency found
for light emitted by atoms in motion as opposed to light emitted by atoms at
rest. This phenomenon, known as the Doppler effect, was introduced in Chapter 17 as it pertains to sound waves. In the case of sound, the motion of the
source with respect to the medium of propagation can be distinguished from

39.5 The Lorentz Transformation Equations

1265

the motion of the observer with respect to the medium. Light waves must be analyzed differently, however, because they require no medium of propagation,
and no method exists for distinguishing the motion of a light source from the
motion of the observer.
If a light source and an observer approach each other with a relative speed v,
the frequency f obs measured by the observer is

!1 ⫹ v/c
!1 ⫺ v/c

f obs ⫽

f source

(39.10)

where f source is the frequency of the source measured in its rest frame. Note that
this relativistic Doppler shift formula, unlike the Doppler shift formula for sound,
depends only on the relative speed v of the source and observer and holds for relative speeds as great as c. As you might expect, the formula predicts that
f obs ⬎ f source when the source and observer approach each other. We obtain the
expression for the case in which the source and observer recede from each other
by replacing v with ⫺v in Equation 39.10.
The most spectacular and dramatic use of the relativistic Doppler effect is the
measurement of shifts in the frequency of light emitted by a moving astronomical
object such as a galaxy. Spectral lines normally found in the extreme violet region
for galaxies at rest with respect to the Earth are shifted by about 100 nm toward
the red end of the spectrum for distant galaxies — indicating that these galaxies
are receding from us. The American astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889 – 1953) performed extensive measurements of this red shift to conﬁrm that most galaxies are
moving away from us, indicating that the Universe is expanding.

THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION EQUATIONS

We have seen that the Galilean transformation equations are not valid when v approaches the speed of light. In this section, we state the correct transformation
equations that apply for all speeds in the range 0 ⱕ v ⬍ c.
Suppose that an event that occurs at some point P is reported by two observers, one at rest in a frame S and the other in a frame S⬘ that is moving to the
right with speed v, as in Figure 39.15. The observer in S reports the event with
space – time coordinates (x, y, z, t), and the observer in S⬘ reports the same event
using the coordinates (x⬘, y⬘, z⬘, t⬘). We would like to ﬁnd a relationship between
these coordinates that is valid for all speeds.
The equations that are valid from v ⫽ 0 to v ⫽ c and enable us to transform
coordinates from S to S⬘ are the Lorentz transformation equations:

These transformation equations were developed by Hendrik A. Lorentz
(1853 – 1928) in 1890 in connection with electromagnetism. However, it was Einstein who recognized their physical signiﬁcance and took the bold step of interpreting them within the framework of the special theory of relativity.
Note the difference between the Galilean and Lorentz time equations. In the
Galilean case, t ⫽ t⬘, but in the Lorentz case the value for t⬘ assigned to an event
by an observer O⬘ standing at the origin of the S⬘ frame in Figure 39.15 depends
both on the time t and on the coordinate x as measured by an observer O standing
in the S frame. This is consistent with the notion that an event is characterized by
four space – time coordinates (x, y, z, t). In other words, in relativity, space and
time are not separate concepts but rather are closely interwoven with each other.
If we wish to transform coordinates in the S⬘ frame to coordinates in the S
frame, we simply replace v by ⫺v and interchange the primed and unprimed coordinates in Equations 39.11:

v 2/c 2 V 1; thus, ␥ ⫽ 1, and Equations 39.11 reduce to the Galilean space – time
transformation equations:

In many situations, we would like to know the difference in coordinates between two events or the time interval between two events as seen by observers O
and O⬘. We can accomplish this by writing the Lorentz equations in a form suitable
for describing pairs of events. From Equations 39.11 and 39.12, we can express the
differences between the four variables x, x⬘, t, and t⬘ in the form

Although relative motion of the two frames along the x axis does not change the y and z coordinates

clocks.

Solution (a) Suppose that two events are simultaneous according to a moving observer O⬘, such that ⌬t ⬘ ⫽ 0. From
the expression for ⌬t given in Equation 39.14, we see that in
this case the time interval ⌬t measured by a stationary observer O is ⌬t ⫽ ␥v ⌬x ⬘/c 2. That is, the time interval for the
same two events as measured by O is nonzero, and so the
events do not appear to be simultaneous to O.

(b) Suppose that observer O⬘ ﬁnds that two events occur
at the same place (⌬x ⬘ ⫽ 0) but at different times (⌬t ⬘ ⫽ 0).
In this situation, the expression for ⌬t given in Equation
39.14 becomes ⌬t ⫽ ␥ ⌬t ⬘. This is the equation for time dilation found earlier (Eq. 39.7), where ⌬t ⬘ ⫽ ⌬t p is the proper
time measured by a clock located in the moving frame of observer O⬘.

Relative Velocity of Spaceships

Two spaceships A and B are moving in opposite directions, as
shown in Figure 39.16. An observer on the Earth measures
the speed of ship A to be 0.750c and the speed of ship B to be
0.850c. Find the velocity of ship B as observed by the crew on

From this result, we see that an object moving with a speed c relative to an observer in S also has a speed c relative to an observer in S⬘ — independent of the relative motion of S and S⬘. Note that this conclusion is consistent with Einstein’s second postulate — that the speed of light must be c relative to all inertial reference
frames. Furthermore, the speed of an object can never exceed c. That is, the speed
of light is the ultimate speed. We return to this point later when we consider the
energy of a particle.

The negative sign indicates that ship B is moving in the negative x direction as observed by the crew on ship A. Note that
the speed is less than c. That is, a body whose speed is less

c in any other frame. (If the Galilean velocity transformation

RELATIVISTIC LINEAR MOMENTUM AND THE
RELATIVISTIC FORM OF NEWTON’S LAWS

We have seen that in order to describe properly the motion of particles within the
framework of the special theory of relativity, we must replace the Galilean transformation equations by the Lorentz transformation equations. Because the laws of physics
must remain unchanged under the Lorentz transformation, we must generalize Newton’s laws and the deﬁnitions of linear momentum and energy to conform to the
Lorentz transformation equations and the principle of relativity. These generalized
deﬁnitions should reduce to the classical (nonrelativistic) deﬁnitions for v V c.
First, recall that the law of conservation of linear momentum states that when
two isolated objects collide, their combined total momentum remains constant.
Suppose that the collision is described in a reference frame S in which linear momentum is conserved. If we calculate the velocities in a second reference frame S⬘
using the Lorentz velocity transformation equation and the classical deﬁnition of
linear momentum, p ⫽ mu (where u is the velocity of either object), we ﬁnd that
linear momentum is not conserved in S⬘. However, because the laws of physics are
the same in all inertial frames, linear momentum must be conserved in all frames.
In view of this condition and assuming that the Lorentz velocity transformation
equation is correct, we must modify the deﬁnition of linear momentum to satisfy
the following conditions:
• Linear momentum p must be conserved in all collisions.
• The relativistic value calculated for p must approach the classical value mu as u

approaches zero.
For any particle, the correct relativistic equation for linear momentum that
satisﬁes these conditions is

where u is the velocity of the particle and m is the mass of the particle. When u is
much less than c, ␥ ⫽ (1 ⫺ u 2/c 2 )⫺1/2 approaches unity and p approaches mu.
Therefore, the relativistic equation for p does indeed reduce to the classical expression when u is much smaller than c.
The relativistic force F acting on a particle whose linear momentum is p is deﬁned as

where p is given by Equation 39.19. This expression, which is the relativistic form
of Newton’s second law, is reasonable because it preserves classical mechanics in

It is left as an end-of-chapter problem (Problem 63) to show that under relativistic conditions, the acceleration a of a particle decreases under the action of a
constant force, in which case a ⬀ (1 ⫺ u 2/c 2 )3/2. From this formula, note that as
the particle’s speed approaches c, the acceleration caused by any ﬁnite force approaches zero. Hence, it is impossible to accelerate a particle from rest to a speed
u ⱖ c.

RELATIVISTIC ENERGY

We have seen that the deﬁnition of linear momentum and the laws of motion require generalization to make them compatible with the principle of relativity. This
implies that the deﬁnition of kinetic energy must also be modiﬁed.
To derive the relativistic form of the work – kinetic energy theorem, let us ﬁrst
use the deﬁnition of relativistic force, Equation 39.20, to determine the work done
on a particle by a force F :

This is Einstein’s famous equation about mass – energy equivalence.
The relationship E ⫽ K ⫹ mc 2 shows that mass is a form of energy, where c 2
in the rest energy term is just a constant conversion factor. This expression also
shows that a small mass corresponds to an enormous amount of energy, a concept
fundamental to nuclear and elementary-particle physics.
In many situations, the linear momentum or energy of a particle is measured
rather than its speed. It is therefore useful to have an expression relating the total
energy E to the relativistic linear momentum p. This is accomplished by using the
expressions E ⫽ ␥mc 2 and p ⫽ ␥mu. By squaring these equations and subtracting,
we can eliminate u (Problem 39). The result, after some algebra, is6

When the particle is at rest, p ⫽ 0 and so E ⫽ E R ⫽ mc 2. For particles that have
zero mass, such as photons, we set m ⫽ 0 in Equation 39.26 and see that
E ⫽ pc

(39.27)

This equation is an exact expression relating total energy and linear momentum
for photons, which always travel at the speed of light.
Finally, note that because the mass m of a particle is independent of its motion, m must have the same value in all reference frames. For this reason, m is often called the invariant mass. On the other hand, because the total energy and
linear momentum of a particle both depend on velocity, these quantities depend
on the reference frame in which they are measured.
Because m is a constant, we conclude from Equation 39.26 that the quantity
E 2 ⫺ p 2c 2 must have the same value in all reference frames. That is, E 2 ⫺ p 2c 2 is
invariant under a Lorentz transformation. (Equations 39.26 and 39.27 do not
make provision for potential energy.)

carries linear momentum p ⫽ E /c. Hence, if momentum is to be conserved, the
box must recoil to the left with a speed v. If it is assumed that the box is very mas-

sive, the recoil speed is much less than the speed of light, and conservation of momentum gives M boxv ⫽ E /c, or

The time it takes the light pulse to move the length of the box is approximately
⌬t ⫽ L /c. In this time interval, the box moves a small distance ⌬x to the left,

The light then strikes the right end of the box and transfers its momentum to the
box, causing the box to stop. With the box in its new position, its center of mass
appears to have moved to the left. However, its center of mass cannot have moved
because the box is an isolated system. Einstein resolved this perplexing situation
by assuming that in addition to energy and momentum, light also carries mass. If
M pulse is the effective mass carried by the pulse of light and if the center of mass of
the system (box plus pulse of light) is to remain ﬁxed, then

Thus, Einstein reached the profound conclusion that “if a body gives off the energy E in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by E /c 2, . . .”
Although we derived the relationship E ⫽ mc 2 for light energy, the equivalence of mass and energy is universal. Equation 39.24, E ⫽ ␥mc 2, which represents
the total energy of any particle, suggests that even when a particle is at rest (␥ ⫽ 1)
it still possesses enormous energy because it has mass. Probably the clearest experimental proof of the equivalence of mass and energy occurs in nuclear and elementary particle interactions, where large amounts of energy are released and the energy release is accompanied by a decrease in mass. Because energy and mass are
related, we see that the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass
are one and the same. Simply put, this law states that
The release of enormous quantities of energy from subatomic particles, accompanied by changes in their masses, is the basis of all nuclear reactions. In a
conventional nuclear reactor, a uranium nucleus undergoes ﬁssion, a reaction that
creates several lighter fragments having considerable kinetic energy. The com-

Because mass is a measure of energy, can we conclude that
the mass of a compressed spring is greater than the mass of
the same spring when it is not compressed?

Binding Energy of the Deuteron

A deuteron, which is the nucleus of a deuterium atom,
contains one proton and one neutron and has a mass of
2.013 553 u. This total deuteron mass is not equal to the sum
of the masses of the proton and neutron. Calculate the mass
difference and determine its energy equivalence, which is
called the binding energy of the nucleus.

Solution

cording to the special theory of relativity, any change in the
total energy of a system is equivalent to a change in the mass
of the system. Therefore, the mass of a compressed (or
stretched) spring is greater than the mass of the spring in its
equilibrium position by an amount U/c 2.

Using atomic mass units (u), we have
m p ⫽ mass of proton ⫽ 1.007 276 u
m n ⫽ mass of neutron ⫽ 1.008 665 u
m p ⫹ m n ⫽ 2.015 941 u

tion, 1 u ⫽ 1.66 ⫻ 10 ⫺27 kg, and therefore
⌬m ⫽ 0.002 388 u ⫽ 3.96 ⫻ 10 ⫺30 kg
Using E ⫽ ⌬mc 2, we ﬁnd that the binding energy is
E ⫽ ⌬mc 2 ⫽ (3.96 ⫻ 10 ⫺30 kg)(3.00 ⫻ 10 8 m/s)2
⫽ 3.56 ⫻ 10 ⫺13 J ⫽ 2.23 MeV
Therefore, the minimum energy required to separate the
proton from the neutron of the deuterium nucleus (the
binding energy) is 2.23 MeV.

The mass difference ⌬m is therefore 0.002 388 u. By deﬁni-

generation of electric power.
In the nuclear reaction called fusion, two atomic nuclei combine to form a single nucleus. The fusion reaction in which two deuterium nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus is of major importance in current research and the development of
controlled-fusion reactors. The decrease in mass that results from the creation of
one helium nucleus from two deuterium nuclei is ⌬m ⫽ 4.25 ⫻ 10⫺29 kg. Hence,
the corresponding excess energy that results from one fusion reaction is ⌬mc 2 ⫽
3.83 ⫻ 10⫺12 J ⫽ 23.9 MeV. To appreciate the magnitude of this result, note that if
1 g of deuterium is converted to helium, the energy released is about 1012 J! At
the current cost of electrical energy, this quantity of energy would be worth about
$70 000.

Figure 39.21 (a) In frame S, the positive charge q moves to the right with a velocity v, and the
current-carrying wire is stationary. A magnetic ﬁeld B surrounds the wire, and charge experiences a magnetic force directed away from the wire. (b) In frame S⬘, the wire moves to the left
with a velocity ⫺v, and the charge q is stationary. The wire creates an electric ﬁeld E, and the
charge experiences an electric force directed away from the wire.

server in this frame, an electric ﬁeld surrounds the charge. However, an observer
in frame S says that the charge is in motion and therefore measures both an electric ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld measured by the observer in
frame S is created by the moving charge, which constitutes an electric current. In
other words, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are viewed differently in frames of reference that are moving relative to each other. We now describe one situation that
shows how an electric ﬁeld in one frame of reference is viewed as a magnetic ﬁeld
in another frame of reference.
A positive test charge q is moving parallel to a current-carrying wire with velocity v relative to the wire in frame S, as shown in Figure 39.21a. We assume that the
net charge on the wire is zero and that the electrons in the wire also move with velocity v in a straight line. The leftward current in the wire produces a magnetic
ﬁeld that forms circles around the wire and is directed into the page at the location of the moving test charge. Therefore, a magnetic force FB ⫽ q v ⴛ B directed
away from the wire is exerted on the test charge. However, no electric force acts on
the test charge because the net charge on the wire is zero when viewed in this
frame.
Now consider the same situation as viewed from frame S⬘, where the test
charge is at rest (Figure 39.21b). In this frame, the positive charges in the wire
move to the left, the electrons in the wire are at rest, and the wire still carries a cur-

CHAPTER 39

rent. Because the test charge is not moving in this frame, FB ⫽ q v ⴛ B ⫽ 0; there
is no magnetic force exerted on the test charge when viewed in this frame. However, if a force is exerted on the test charge in frame S⬘, the frame of the wire, as
described earlier, a force must be exerted on it in any other frame. What is the origin of this force in frame S, the frame of the test charge?
The answer to this question is provided by the special theory of relativity.
When the situation is viewed in frame S, as in Figure 39.21a, the positive charges
are at rest and the electrons in the wire move to the right with a velocity v. Because
of length contraction, the electrons appear to be closer together than their proper
separation. Because there is no net charge on the wire this contracted separation
must equal the separation between the stationary positive charges. The situation is
quite different when viewed in frame S⬘, shown in Figure 39.21b. In this frame, the
positive charges appear closer together because of length contraction, and the
electrons in the wire are at rest with a separation that is greater than that viewed in
frame S. Therefore, there is a net positive charge on the wire when viewed in
frame S⬘. This net positive charge produces an electric ﬁeld pointing away from
the wire toward the test charge, and so the test charge experiences an electric
force directed away from the wire. Thus, what was viewed as a magnetic ﬁeld (and
a corresponding magnetic force) in the frame of the wire transforms into an electric ﬁeld (and a corresponding electric force) in the frame of the test charge.

THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

Up to this point, we have sidestepped a curious puzzle. Mass has two seemingly different properties: a gravitational attraction for other masses and an inertial property
that resists acceleration. To designate these two attributes, we use the subscripts g
and i and write
Gravitational property
Inertial property

Fg ⫽ mg g
⌺F ⫽ m i a

The value for the gravitational constant G was chosen to make the magnitudes
of m g and m i numerically equal. Regardless of how G is chosen, however, the strict
proportionality of m g and m i has been established experimentally to an extremely
high degree: a few parts in 1012. Thus, it appears that gravitational mass and inertial mass may indeed be exactly proportional.
But why? They seem to involve two entirely different concepts: a force of mutual gravitational attraction between two masses, and the resistance of a single
mass to being accelerated. This question, which puzzled Newton and many other
physicists over the years, was answered when Einstein published his theory of gravitation, known as his general theory of relativity, in 1916. Because it is a mathematically
complex theory, we offer merely a hint of its elegance and insight.
In Einstein’s view, the remarkable coincidence that m g and m i seemed to be
proportional to each other was evidence of an intimate and basic connection between the two concepts. He pointed out that no mechanical experiment (such as
dropping a mass) could distinguish between the two situations illustrated in Figure
39.22a and b. In each case, the dropped briefcase undergoes a downward acceleration g relative to the ﬂoor.
Einstein carried this idea further and proposed that no experiment, mechanical or otherwise, could distinguish between the two cases. This extension to in-

(a) The observer is at rest in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld g. (b) The observer is
in a region where gravity is negligible, but the frame of reference is accelerated by an external
force F that produces an acceleration g. According to Einstein, the frames of reference in parts
(a) and (b) are equivalent in every way. No local experiment can distinguish any difference between the two frames. (c) If parts (a) and (b) are truly equivalent, as Einstein proposed, then a
ray of light should bend in a gravitational ﬁeld.

clude all phenomena (not just mechanical ones) has interesting consequences.
For example, suppose that a light pulse is sent horizontally across the elevator.
During the time it takes the light to make the trip, the right wall of the elevator
has accelerated upward. This causes the light to arrive at a location lower on the
wall than the spot it would have hit if the elevator were not accelerating. Thus,
in the frame of the elevator, the trajectory of the light pulse bends downward as
the elevator accelerates upward to meet it. Because the accelerating elevator
cannot be distinguished from a nonaccelerating one located in a gravitational
ﬁeld, Einstein proposed that a beam of light should also be bent downward by a
gravitational ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 39.22c. Experiments have veriﬁed the effect, although the bending is small. A laser aimed at the horizon falls less than
1 cm after traveling 6 000 km. (No such bending is predicted in Newton’s theory
of gravitation.)
The two postulates of Einstein’s general theory of relativity are
• All the laws of nature have the same form for observers in any frame of refer-

ence, whether accelerated or not.

incorporates relativistically corrected time

CHAPTER 39

Relativity

• In the vicinity of any point, a gravitational ﬁeld is equivalent to an accelerated

frame of reference in the absence of gravitational effects. (This is the principle of
equivalence.)
The second postulate implies that gravitational mass and inertial mass are completely equivalent, not just proportional. What were thought to be two different
types of mass are actually identical.
One interesting effect predicted by the general theory is that time scales are
altered by gravity. A clock in the presence of gravity runs more slowly than one located where gravity is negligible. Consequently, the frequencies of radiation emitted by atoms in the presence of a strong gravitational ﬁeld are red-shifted to lower
frequencies when compared with the same emissions in the presence of a weak
ﬁeld. This gravitational red shift has been detected in spectral lines emitted by
atoms in massive stars. It has also been veriﬁed on the Earth by comparison of the
frequencies of gamma rays (a high-energy form of electromagnetic radiation)
emitted from nuclei separated vertically by about 20 m.

Quick Quiz 39.7
Two identical clocks are in the same house, one upstairs in a bedroom and the other downstairs in the kitchen. Which clock runs more slowly?

The second postulate suggests that a gravitational ﬁeld may be “transformed
away” at any point if we choose an appropriate accelerated frame of reference — a
freely falling one. Einstein developed an ingenious method of describing the acceleration necessary to make the gravitational ﬁeld “disappear.” He speciﬁed a
concept, the curvature of space – time, that describes the gravitational effect at every
point. In fact, the curvature of space – time completely replaces Newton’s gravitational theory. According to Einstein, there is no such thing as a gravitational force.
Rather, the presence of a mass causes a curvature of space – time in the vicinity of
the mass, and this curvature dictates the space – time path that all freely moving
objects must follow. In 1979, John Wheeler summarized Einstein’s general theory
of relativity in a single sentence: “Space tells matter how to move and matter tells
space how to curve.”

Deﬂection of starlight passing near the Sun. Because of this effect, the Sun or

39.10 Summary

Einstein’s cross. The four bright spots are
images of the same galaxy that have been
bent around a massive object located between the galaxy and the Earth. The massive object acts like a lens, causing the rays
of light that were diverging from the distant
galaxy to converge on the Earth. (If the intervening massive object had a uniform
mass distribution, we would see a bright
ring instead of four spots.)

North Pole but from different starting locations. Even though both say they are
walking due north, and thus should be on parallel paths, they see themselves getting closer and closer together, as if they were somehow attracted to each other.
The curvature of the Earth causes this effect. In a similar way, what we are used to
thinking of as the gravitational attraction between two masses is, in Einstein’s view,
two masses curving space – time and as a result moving toward each other, much
like two bowling balls on a mattress rolling together.
One prediction of the general theory of relativity is that a light ray passing
near the Sun should be deﬂected into the curved space – time created by the Sun’s
mass. This prediction was conﬁrmed when astronomers detected the bending of
starlight near the Sun during a total solar eclipse that occurred shortly after World
War I (Fig. 39.23). When this discovery was announced, Einstein became an international celebrity.
If the concentration of mass becomes very great, as is believed to occur when a
large star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses to a very small volume, a black
hole may form. Here, the curvature of space – time is so extreme that, within a certain distance from the center of the black hole, all matter and light become
trapped.

SUMMARY
The two basic postulates of the special theory of relativity are

• The speed of light in vacuum has the same value, c ⫽ 3.00 ⫻ 10 8 m/s, in all in-

source emitting the light.
Three consequences of the special theory of relativity are
• Events that are simultaneous for one observer are not simultaneous for another

observer who is in motion relative to the ﬁrst.
• Clocks in motion relative to an observer appear to be slowed down by a factor

Nevertheless, some narrow gaps occur in the continuous

ionized calcium atoms at rest produce strong absorption
at a wavelength of 394 nm. For a galaxy in the constellation Hydra, 2 billion lightyears away, this absorption line
is shifted to 475 nm. How fast is the galaxy moving away

ANSWERS TO QUICK QUIZZES
39.1 They both are because they can report only what they
see. They agree that the person in the truck throws the
ball up and then catches it a bit later.
39.2 It depends on the direction of the throw. Taking the direction in which the train is traveling as the positive x
direction, use the values u⬘x ⫽ ⫹90 mi/h and v ⫽
⫹ 110 mi/h, with u x in Equation 39.2 being the value
you are looking for. If the pitcher throws the ball in the
same direction as the train, a person at rest on the Earth
sees the ball moving at 110 mi/h ⫹ 90 mi/h ⫽
200 mi/h. If the pitcher throws in the opposite direction, the person on the Earth sees the ball moving
in the same direction as the train but at only
110 mi/h ⫺ 90 mi/h ⫽ 20 mi/h.
39.3 Both are correct. Although the two observers reach different conclusions, each is correct in her or his own reference frame because the concept of simultaneity is not
absolute.
39.4 About 2.9 ⫻ 108 m/s, because this is the speed at which
␥ ⫽ 5. For every 5 s ticking by on the Mission Control
clock, the Earth-bound observer (with a powerful telescope!) sees the rocket clock ticking off 1 s. The astronaut sees her own clock operating at a normal rate. To
her, Mission Control is moving away from her at a speed
of 2.9 ⫻ 108 m/s, and she sees the Mission Control clock
as running slow. Strange stuff, this relativity!
39.5 If their on-duty time is based on clocks that remain on
the Earth, they will have larger paychecks. Less time will
have passed for the astronauts in their frame of reference than for their employer back on the Earth.

39.6 By a curved line. This can be seen in the middle of
Speedo’s world-line in Figure 39.14, where he turns
around and begins his trip home.
39.7 The downstairs clock runs more slowly because it is
closer to the Earth and hence experiences a stronger
gravitational ﬁeld than the upstairs clock does.

Mathematics Review

These appendices in mathematics are intended as a brief review of operations and
methods. Early in this course, you should be totally familiar with basic algebraic
techniques, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. The appendices on differential
and integral calculus are more detailed and are intended for those students who
have difﬁculty applying calculus concepts to physical situations.

B.1

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION

Many quantities that scientists deal with often have very large or very small
values. For example, the speed of light is about 300 000 000 m/s, and the
ink required to make the dot over an i in this textbook has a mass of about
0.000 000 001 kg. Obviously, it is very cumbersome to read, write, and keep track
of numbers such as these. We avoid this problem by using a method dealing with
powers of the number 10:
10 0  1
10 1  10
10 2  10  10  100
10 3  10  10  10  1000
10 4  10  10  10  10  10 000
10 5  10  10  10  10  10  100 000
and so on. The number of zeros corresponds to the power to which 10 is raised,
called the exponent of 10. For example, the speed of light, 300 000 000 m/s, can
be expressed as 3  108 m/s.
In this method, some representative numbers smaller than unity are

APPENDIX B

In these cases, the number of places the decimal point is to the left of the digit 1
equals the value of the (negative) exponent. Numbers expressed as some power of
10 multiplied by another number between 1 and 10 are said to be in scientiﬁc notation. For example, the scientiﬁc notation for 5 943 000 000 is 5.943  109 and
that for 0.000 083 2 is 8.32  105.
When numbers expressed in scientiﬁc notation are being multiplied, the following general rule is very useful:
10 n  10 m  10 nm

(B.1)

where n and m can be any numbers (not necessarily integers). For example,
10 2  10 5  10 7. The rule also applies if one of the exponents is negative:
10 3  10 8  10 5.
When dividing numbers expressed in scientiﬁc notation, note that
10 n
 10 n  10 m  10 nm
10 m

(B.2)

ALGEBRA

Some Basic Rules
When algebraic operations are performed, the laws of arithmetic apply. Symbols
such as x, y, and z are usually used to represent quantities that are not speciﬁed,
what are called the unknowns.
First, consider the equation
8x  32
If we wish to solve for x, we can divide (or multiply) each side of the equation by
the same factor without destroying the equality. In this case, if we divide both sides
by 8, we have
8x
32

8
8
x4

B.2

Algebra

Next consider the equation
x28
In this type of expression, we can add or subtract the same quantity from each
side. If we subtract 2 from each side, we get
x2282
x6
In general, if x  a  b, then x  b  a.
Now consider the equation
x
9
5
If we multiply each side by 5, we are left with x on the left by itself and 45 on the
right:

冢 5x 冣 (5)  9  5
x  45
In all cases, whatever operation is performed on the left side of the equality must also be performed on the right side.
The following rules for multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions should be recalled, where a, b, and c are three numbers:

For example, x 2x 4  x 24  x 6.

Linear Equations
A linear equation has the general form
y  mx  b

(B.9)

where m and b are constants. This equation is referred to as being linear because
the graph of y versus x is a straight line, as shown in Figure B.1. The constant b,
called the y-intercept, represents the value of y at which the straight line intersects
the y axis. The constant m is equal to the slope of the straight line and is also
equal to the tangent of the angle that the line makes with the x axis. If any two
points on the straight line are speciﬁed by the coordinates (x 1 , y 1 ) and (x 2 , y 2 ), as
in Figure B.1, then the slope of the straight line can be expressed as
Slope 

y2  y1

x2  x1

y
 tan
x

(B.10)

Note that m and b can have either positive or negative values. If m  0, the
straight line has a positive slope, as in Figure B1. If m  0, the straight line has a
negative slope. In Figure B.1, both m and b are positive. Three other possible situations are shown in Figure B.2.

Solving Simultaneous Linear Equations
Consider the equation 3x  5y  15, which has two unknowns, x and y. Such an
equation does not have a unique solution. For example, note that (x  0, y  3),
(x  5, y  0), and (x  2, y  9/5) are all solutions to this equation.
If a problem has two unknowns, a unique solution is possible only if we have
two equations. In general, if a problem has n unknowns, its solution requires n
equations. In order to solve two simultaneous equations involving two unknowns,
x and y, we solve one of the equations for x in terms of y and substitute this expression into the other equation.

EXAMPLE 2
Solve the following two simultaneous equations:

Solution

(1)

5x  y  8

(2)

2x  2y  4

Alternate Solution Multiply each term in (1) by the
factor 2 and add the result to (2):
10x  2y  16
2x  2y  4

From (2), x  y  2. Substitution of this into (1)

12x  12

gives

x  1

5(y  2)  y  8

Two linear equations containing two unknowns can also be solved by a graphical method. If the straight lines corresponding to the two equations are plotted in
a conventional coordinate system, the intersection of the two lines represents the
solution. For example, consider the two equations
xy2
x  2y  1

1 2 3 4 5 6 x
x–y=2

These are plotted in Figure B.3. The intersection of the two lines has the coordinates x  5, y  3. This represents the solution to the equations. You should check
this solution by the analytical technique discussed above.

Logarithms
Suppose that a quantity x is expressed as a power of some quantity a:
x  ay

(B.11)

The number a is called the base number. The logarithm of x with respect to the
base a is equal to the exponent to which the base must be raised in order to satisfy
the expression x  a y :
y  log a x

(B.12)

Conversely, the antilogarithm of y is the number x :
x  antilog a y

(B.13)

In practice, the two bases most often used are base 10, called the common logarithm base, and base e  2.718 . . . , called Euler’s constant or the natural logarithm base. When common logarithms are used,
y  log 10 x

(or x  10 y )

(B.14)

(or x  e y )

(B.15)

When natural logarithms are used,
y  ln e x

For example, log10 52  1.716, so that antilog10 1.716  101.716  52. Likewise,
lne 52  3.951, so antilne 3.951  e 3.951  52.
In general, note that you can convert between base 10 and base e with the
equality
ln e x  (2.302 585) log 10 x

(B.16)

Finally, some useful properties of logarithms are
log(ab)  log a  log b
log(a/b)  log a  log b
log(a n)  n log a

That portion of mathematics based on the special properties of the right triangle is
called trigonometry. By deﬁnition, a right triangle is one containing a 90° angle. Consider the right triangle shown in Figure B.9, where side a is opposite the angle , side b
is adjacent to the angle , and side c is the hypotenuse of the triangle. The three basic
trigonometric functions deﬁned by such a triangle are the sine (sin), cosine (cos), and
tangent (tan) functions. In terms of the angle , these functions are deﬁned by
side opposite

DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

In various branches of science, it is sometimes necessary to use the basic tools of
calculus, invented by Newton, to describe physical phenomena. The use of calculus is fundamental in the treatment of various problems in Newtonian mechanics,
electricity, and magnetism. In this section, we simply state some basic properties
and “rules of thumb” that should be a useful review to the student.
First, a function must be speciﬁed that relates one variable to another (such
as a coordinate as a function of time). Suppose one of the variables is called y (the
dependent variable), the other x (the independent variable). We might have a
function relationship such as
y(x)  ax 3  bx 2  cx  d
If a, b, c, and d are speciﬁed constants, then y can be calculated for any value of x.
We usually deal with continuous functions, that is, those for which y varies
“smoothly” with x.
1 The

approximations for the functions sin x, cos x, and tan x are for x  0.1 rad.

A.25

A.26

APPENDIX B

The derivative of y with respect to x is deﬁned as the limit, as x approaches
zero, of the slopes of chords drawn between two points on the y versus x curve.
Mathematically, we write this deﬁnition as

y
y2
∆y
y1

dy
 lim
x:0
dx

∆x

x1

(B.28)

where y and x are deﬁned as x  x 2  x 1 and y  y 2  y 1 (Fig. B.13). It is
important to note that dy/dx does not mean dy divided by dx, but is simply a notation of the limiting process of the derivative as deﬁned by Equation B.28.
A useful expression to remember when y(x)  ax n, where a is a constant and n
is any positive or negative number (integer or fraction), is

(B.29)

If y(x) is a polynomial or algebraic function of x, we apply Equation B.29 to
each term in the polynomial and take d[constant]/dx  0. In Examples 4 through
7, we evaluate the derivatives of several functions.

EXAMPLE 4
Suppose y(x) (that is, y as a function of x) is given by
y(x) 

ax 3

so

 bx  c

y  y(x  x)  y(x)  a(3x 2 x  3x x 2  x 3 )
b x

where a and b are constants. Then it follows that

Substituting this into Equation B.28 gives

y(x  x)  a(x  x)3
 b(x  x)  c
y(x  x) 

EXAMPLE 5
y(x)  8x 5  4x 3  2x  7

Solution Applying Equation B.29 to each term independently, and remembering that d/dx (constant)  0, we have

dy
 40x 4  12x 2  2

integral because its value depends on the choice of c.

For a general continuous function f(x), the integral can be described as the area
under the curve bounded by f(x) and the x axis, between two speciﬁed values of x,
say, x 1 and x 2 , as in Figure B.14.
The area of the blue element is approximately f(x i ) x i . If we sum all these
area elements from x 1 and x 2 and take the limit of this sum as x i : 0, we obtain
the true area under the curve bounded by f(x) and x, between the limits x 1 and x 2 :
where f(x) is called the integrand and f(x) 

Partial Integration
Sometimes it is useful to apply the method of partial integration (also called “integrating by parts”) to evaluate certain integrals. The method uses the property that

冕

u dv  uv 

冕

(B.39)

v du

where u and v are carefully chosen so as to reduce a complex integral to a simpler
one. In many cases, several reductions have to be made. Consider the function
I(x) 

冕

x 2e x dx

This can be evaluated by integrating by parts twice. First, if we choose u  x 2,
v  e x, we get

冕

x 2e x dx 

冕

x 2 d(e x )  x 2e x  2

冕

e xx dx  c 1

Now, in the second term, choose u  x, v  e x, which gives

冕

or

x 2e x dx  x 2e x  2xe x  2

冕

冕

e x dx  c 1

x 2e x dx  x 2e x  2xe x  2e x  c 2

The Perfect Differential
Another useful method to remember is the use of the perfect differential, in which
we look for a change of variable such that the differential of the function is the differential of the independent variable appearing in the integrand. For example,
consider the integral
I(x) 

冕

cos2 x sin x dx

This becomes easy to evaluate if we rewrite the differential as d(cos x)  sin x dx.
The integral then becomes

冕

cos2 x sin x dx  

冕

cos2 x d(cos x)

If we now change variables, letting y  cos x, we obtain
